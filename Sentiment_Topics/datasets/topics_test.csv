9,0,""" Tokyo Eyes "" tells of a 17 year old Japanese girl who falls in like with a man being hunted by her big bro who is a cop . This lame flick is about 50 % filler and 50 % talk , talk , and more talk . You 'll get to see the less than stellar cast of three as they talk on the bus , talk and play video games , talk and get a haircut , talk and walk and walk and talk , talk on cell phones , hang out and talk , etc . as you read subtitles waiting for something to happen . The thin wisp of a story is not sufficient to support a film with low end production value , a meager cast , and no action , no romance , no sex or nudity , no heavy drama ... just incessant yadayadayada'ing .

28,0,"Uhhh ... so , did they even have writers for this ? Maybe I 'm picky , but I like a little dialog with my movies . And , as far as slasher films go , just a sliver of character development will suffice . Unfortunately , The Prey provides neitherand if you think I 'm being hyperbolic , you 'll just have to see it for yourself . Scene after scene , we just get actors standing around , looking forlorn and awkward , abandoned by any sense of a script . Outside of calling out each other 's names when they get separated in the woods ( natch ) , the only instances where these people say something substantive is when one character explains the constellation Orion ( clearly plagiarized from Funk & Wagnalls ; scintillating slasher fare , no ? ) and another rehashes an old campfire tale that does n't even have anything to do with the plot ( wait , what IS the plot ? ) At other times , The Prey actually has the gall to film its characters with the boom mic just far away enough so that we ca n't exactly hear what they 're saying . So we get entire scenes wherein the actors are murmuring ! Deliberately ! Seriously , I 've seen more dialog in a silent film . It 's as if the filmmakers sat down at a bar somewhere in Rancho Cucamonga in the heyday of the ' 80s slasher craze and one looked at the other and said , "" Hey , I got ta really sweet idea for a gory decapitation gag . Let 's somehow pad an entire feature around it . "" And ... well , they did . To be fair , The Prey probably had some sort of writer on board . I mean , somebody had to jot down the scene sequence and label the dailies . However , I am fully convinced that this film did not have an editor of any kind whatsoever . There are glaring pauses , boring tableaux , and zero sense of pacing throughout . The filmmakers do n't have anything else in the "" script "" to film , so they fill out the running time with exhaustive taxonomies of the flora and fauna that inhabit the forest in which our wild and crazy teens are getting sliced and diced . These critters are all filmed in straightforward , noontime daylight in a completely reserved fashion and with no attempt at atmospheric photography . If it feels like a science film , that 's because it is . I 'm pretty sure this is all nature show stock footageall that 's missing is a stuffy narration from some National Geographic alderman . More exciting footage that was graciously spared from the cutting room floor : a scene in which two men discuss cucumber and cream cheese sandwiches , and another scene wherein a supporting character strums away on a banjo for what feels like an entire minute - and - a- half ! A minute - and - a - half ! That 's a lot of banjoing to commit to celluloid to begin with , let alone insert into the final cut of the film ! Way to go , guys ! Brevity and concision are the real victims of this slaughterfest . Admittedly , the film picks up quite a bit of steam ( comparatively ) in the last 25 minutes , into which much of the carnage is condensed and where a rip - off of Béla Bartók 's "" Music for Strings , Percussion and Celesta "" cuts in . Vaudeville great Jackie Coogan makes a fun appearance as a tubby , bumbly park ranger ( this was his last role , if you can believe it ) . And there are some nice gory moments , including a splattery neck tearing and the aforementioned decapitation . The make - up used for the killer ( Carel Struycken , aka "" Lurch "" from the Addams Family movies ) is also quite effective , and makes him look like a strange hybrid of young Jason Voorhees and Freddy Krueger . Plus , if you love wacky , straight - outta - left - field endings , you need to check out how they wrap this puppy up . You 'll do a spit take , I promise . Usually , I love films that are on this level of ineptitude , but the first three - quarters of The Prey are just so interminably boring that they pretty much spoil the rest . Overall , this is a largely pallid and tedious affair , and , while it ai n't all bad , it should really only be seen by debilitated slasher completists . Why do we do this to ourselves , anyway ?",825,0,0.0001503759398496378,0.08815546473214611,0.0001503759398496378,0.0001503759398496378,0.0001503759398496378,0.0001503759398496378,0.0001503759398496378,0.014309311543970618,0.0001503759398496378,0.0001503759398496378,0.0001503759398496378,0.0001503759398496378,0.12877331938711856,0.0001503759398496378,0.02269194545238918,0.0001503759398496378,0.0001503759398496378,0.0001503759398496378,0.007662810296237033,0.0001503759398496378,0.36554968416966427,0.07515891714428645,0.0001503759398496378,0.0001503759398496378,0.0001503759398496378,0.0001503759398496378,0.0001503759398496378,0.0001503759398496378,0.0001503759398496378,0.0001503759398496378,0.0001503759398496378,0.0001503759398496378,0.04650442897869632,0.0001503759398496378,0.0001503759398496378,0.0001503759398496378,0.0001503759398496378,0.0001503759398496378,0.0001503759398496378,0.0001503759398496378,0.0001503759398496378,0.0001503759398496378,0.0001503759398496378,0.2450287047616564,0.0001503759398496378,0.0001503759398496378,0.0001503759398496378,0.0001503759398496378,0.0001503759398496378,0.0001503759398496378,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
160,0,"Does anyone else think that "" Reba "" is basically a ripoff of "" Roseanne "" ? Just look at the characters from the two families , Connors ( Roseanne ) and Harts ( Reba ) ; the blonde bombshell elder daughter ( Becky Connor and Cheyenne Hart ) who 's married to a moron ( Mark Healy and Van Montgomery ) , the sarcastic brunette younger daughter ( Darlene Connor and Kyra Hart ) , the little brother ( DJ Connor and Jake Hart ) , and the quirky relative ( Jackie Connor and Barbara - Jean Booker Hart ) . And then , of course , there is the biggest similarity , Reba Hart and Roseanne Connor . "" Reba "" tried to copy the sarcastic and tough - love style mom without giving her the same lovable qualities as Roseanne had . Or , perhaps , they made her * too * lovable , for Reba Hart seems to waver between being mean and scary ( hence Van 's line to his wife Cheyenne "" I 'm not afraid of you , I 'm afraid of your mother ! "" ) and being sweet and caring with little transition in between . Roseanne at least managed to get it across that she was being cruel to be kind , since she was always mean and sarcastic and , whenever she tried to open up , it was hard for her . As inconsistent as Reba 's character is , it 's hard for her to be believable . But even if the characters were n't completely ripped off of "" Roseanne "" , nothing could 've saved the show from being sub - par in the plot area . The writers try to give the show substance but they really ca n't lay off the corny jokes long enough to give any impact . And you 'd better believe the jokes are corny ; it 's as if they were written by a twelve - year - old who thinks that any joke is hilarious . While occasionally they come out with something that 's funny ( I do n't pretend that I did n't laugh at a few episodes ) these gems are too few and far between to make "" Reba "" witty . Overall , "" Reba "" is a very mediocre show with obvious ripoffs of "" Roseanne "" , sub - par plots and sub - sub - par humor , and ( let 's face it ) terrible acting . The show might be a bit better , actually , if they replaced all the actors , especially Reba herself , who is more community- theater quality than prime - time sitcom quality . I give it a 3 out of 10 just to be fair to the good jokes that make it in .",484,0,0.00032258064516132035,0.00032258064516132035,0.045373963204237255,0.00032258064516132035,0.00032258064516132035,0.00032258064516132035,0.00032258064516132035,0.00032258064516132035,0.00032258064516132035,0.00032258064516132035,0.00032258064516132035,0.00032258064516132035,0.2621340257803118,0.00032258064516132035,0.00032258064516132035,0.00032258064516132035,0.00032258064516132035,0.00032258064516132035,0.00032258064516132035,0.00032258064516132035,0.26669098983887546,0.3188724417469921,0.00032258064516132035,0.00032258064516132035,0.00032258064516132035,0.024010063121277972,0.00032258064516132035,0.00032258064516132035,0.00032258064516132035,0.00032258064516132035,0.00032258064516132035,0.00032258064516132035,0.019234410060943275,0.00032258064516132035,0.00032258064516132035,0.00032258064516132035,0.00032258064516132035,0.00032258064516132035,0.00032258064516132035,0.00032258064516132035,0.00032258064516132035,0.04981313850542524,0.00032258064516132035,0.00032258064516132035,0.00032258064516132035,0.00032258064516132035,0.00032258064516132035,0.00032258064516132035,0.00032258064516132035,0.00032258064516132035,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
246,0,"Over the GW is a near failure of a debut feature , and not because it 's not without trying ... Actually , it is . It 's a shamble all the more because it 's writer / director / technical everyman Nick Gaglia went through the same rehab cult that he depicts in the film . Sometimes a first time filmmaker , full of the vigor that comes with getting a thumbs up or two from fellow film students , goes headlong into style that is way too disjointed , unsure , and dramatically frustrating that the personal side of the story , the extremely personal side , gets smudged in the purpose of telling a good story . Gaglia , who was 13 when put into a horrid program that basically tortured and brainwashed their "" patients "" with crazy group scare tactics , psychological mind - f * * * sessions that could go on for days , and attitudes from the rehab leaders that would make most Nazis cringe , escaped finally when he was 15 . I 'm glad he got out , though it might help if he now goes into a real rehab for his film - making skills , if only for a couple of days , to learn things like , say , structure , proper lighting , fluid camera movement , subtlety with actors , and other basics that are perpetually lost here . It 's all the more frustrating because Gaglia is dealing with a subject that should be shown more to the public ( there was recently a Newsweek article referring to a similar AA cult - rehab ) . Many times one wonders if certain personal character studies might work better as documentaries as opposed to narrative dramas . This is an ever - nagging sensation throughout Over the GW , where it almost feels like Gaglia wants to tell the truth but does n't know how to communicate it properly through his characters . The character that one would think is closest to him , Bronx teen Tony Serra ( Gallagher ) , who is taken by his mother to a rehab in New Jersey , would be closest to Gaglia , is actually much more of a one - dimensional being , where there is very little back - story ( we see a brief freak - out , in black and white , in his old home ) and little connection to his mother ( Moriarty ) , who has more potential that is never tapped aside from a cold stone who passes her kids off to another . But there is a story to go with his two - year crisis , I guess . Right off the bat things get rough ( a nude cavity search in the first five minutes ) , and soon it 's clear that instead of medical care it 's more like a cross between anger management and some bizarre religious sect , where the head doctor Hiller ( Insinnia ) is a total over - controlling loon . But soon Tony 's sister Sofia ( Donohue ) gets thrown in to the program , and as opposed to Tony 's repeated moments of outrage and supposed non - compliance , she goes head - on through the whacked - out three step program and once released becoming a runaway . At times there are bits in this fractured nightmare , where there 's one woman , a 22 year old mother who has been in the program a year and a half finds she 's become a prisoner not allowed to leave , and when the father of the main siblings comes and pays an enraged visit to Hiller when Sofia finally returns to them , that do contain some raw power , very brief glimpses of Gaglia being able to at least garner some leverage in pure melodrama . But these are moments few and far between . It 's not just the unsuccessful characters , who are mostly reduced to stereotypes that veer into being like hysterical D.A.R.E. rip - offs ( maybe some of them , like an angry black youth , the passive - aggressive counselors , or even Serra 's older sister who is ratted out by the siblings as having taken a hit off a joint and almost thrown into the program , would resonate more if there was more time given to develop any of them ) . It 's that Gaglia is so unfocused in his multiple roles on his tiny $ 30,000 budget that not one side of whatever potential talent he has can come through . He over - uses tints , mostly with a shade that looks urine - coated ) , he jiggles his hand - held DVX camera as if it 's supposed to be intense ala City of God , occasionally a character will just shoot into frame randomly , his choices of music are like the worst selections possible from pseudo - indie soft - rockers , and there 's even inane fake interview scenes with Nicholas Serra ( inspiration ? ) and Krakowsky that feel about as false as possible .

264,0,""" The Racketeer "" stars Carol ( deprived of the "" e "" that usually appeared at the end of her first name ) Lombard as a woman thrown out of society because she left her husband for a concert violinist ( Roland Drew ) who has since become a down - and - out alcoholic , and torn between her love for him and the interest of New York crime kingpin Robert Armstrong ( top - billed ) . It 's virtually a compendium of what was wrong with the earliest talkies : stiff direction , immobile cameras , stagy acting and ridiculously slow - paced delivery of lines . At the time the sound crews were telling the directors to have their actors speak every line s - l - o - w - l - y and not to start speaking their own line until after the previous actor had finished theirs . Done about five years later , this could have been an interesting movie , but director Howard Higgin faithfully follows his sound recorder 's dictates and systematically undercuts the talents we know Lombard and Armstrong had from watching their later movies . "" The Racketeer "" was made in 1929 , a year that despite the transition problems from silent to sound nonetheless gave us some legitimate masterpieces  Vidor 's "" Hallelujah ! , "" Mamoulian 's "" Applause , "" Wyler 's "" Hell 's Heroes , "" Capra 's "" Ladies of Leisure ""  all from directors with strong enough wills to tell the soundboard dictators to get stuffed and let their actors talk and act naturalistically . Too bad Howard Higgin was n't that strong ; as it is , watching a naturally rapid - paced actor like Armstrong slog through the part in the ridiculous way he 's been told to speak , one ca n't help but wonder where that 50-foot gorilla is when Armstrong needs him .",331,0,0.0003921568627451377,0.0003921568627451377,0.0003921568627451377,0.0003921568627451377,0.0003921568627451377,0.0003921568627451377,0.0003921568627451377,0.0003921568627451377,0.0003921568627451377,0.0003921568627451377,0.0003921568627451377,0.0003921568627451377,0.0003921568627451377,0.0003921568627451377,0.0003921568627451377,0.0003921568627451377,0.0003921568627451377,0.0003921568627451377,0.0003921568627451377,0.0003921568627451377,0.4720723328465402,0.0003921568627451377,0.0003921568627451377,0.02439734748988145,0.0003921568627451377,0.0003921568627451377,0.3845355181857189,0.0003921568627451377,0.05921568627451409,0.018148984274874456,0.0003921568627451377,0.0003921568627451377,0.0003921568627451377,0.0003921568627451377,0.0003921568627451377,0.0003921568627451377,0.0003921568627451377,0.0003921568627451377,0.0003921568627451377,0.0003921568627451377,0.024375228967684785,0.0003921568627451377,0.0003921568627451377,0.0003921568627451377,0.0003921568627451377,0.0003921568627451377,0.0003921568627451377,0.0003921568627451377,0.0003921568627451377,0.0003921568627451377,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

479,0,"After seeing the DVD release of the Blues Brothers , and their mention of "" Wired "" on Belushi 's bio , my boyfriend and I were hungry for more information on John Belushi . I had heard of "" Wired "" but did n't know too much about it and found it way in the back of the local rental store . I understand that Dan Akroyd was really p***ed over this movie and I thought it was because it did n't portray them in a good light . But that had nothing to do with it . The movie starts out okay , until they wheel in John 's body to the morgue . When he wakes up on the autopsy table , and decides to run for it , then begins the utter tastelessness of this movie . John is subjected to viewing his life and all of the turmoil he created with "" Angel , "" a Puerto Rican cab driver with a wicked sense of humor -- subjecting him to criticism and attempting to try to get him to cross over . The two actors who portray John and Dan look nothing even remotely close to the real actors , ( let alone anyone else related for that matter , i.e. , Lorne Michaels , ) making it difficult to really try to concentrate on them and how they were in real life ... but that is the tip of the iceberg . I believe this was supposed to be an "" artsy "" film -- John constantly being tormented by drugs ( i.e. , the powdered soap in the bathroom being cocaine , ) in such a way that was also difficult to follow . The flashbacks are choppy , also making it difficult to understand . Probably the most tasteless scene was when John is ( literally , ) forced to undergo his autopsy and is in pain while they remove his heart to weigh it , saying that it was abnormally large due to drug use , obesity , yeah , we get the point without the grotesque portrayal . There are very few other actors we know of in the movie , ( where 's Carrie Fisher for instance ? They were incredibly close . And Jim Belushi would have been a great person to show , ) it looks VERY cheaply made , ( we felt it looked as if the graphics were from the early 80s or late 70s , ) it felt as if it was filmed in about a week and all in all , did n't show the side to John at all . I felt I knew a little bit more about him from watching episodes of Saturday Night Live . On one last note , Bob Woodward comes across narcissistic by placing himself in the movie , arguing with John about writing his life story . For someone who was supposed to be very highbrow , concerning the bust on Nixon , his calibur of person could match any writer in the National Enquirer , and therefore losing my interest in any of his work from this point forward . SKIP THIS MOVIE . If you want to see more on John , watch his movies , see clips of Dan Akroyd talking about him or hope someone has the taste to make another movie on John that goes along the lines of "" Man on the Moon , "" which is ultimately what we were expecting . I guess this was a "" moral "" kind of movie -- you know , do n't do drugs , but I guess the creators of this film did n't understand that his death made a number of people ( like Carrie Fisher , ) stop doing drugs altogether for that reason .",647,0,0.2468905063567929,0.00017241379310346672,0.00017241379310346672,0.046316349237775736,0.00017241379310346672,0.00017241379310346672,0.00017241379310346672,0.19832225590227118,0.00017241379310346672,0.00017241379310346672,0.00017241379310346672,0.00017241379310346672,0.00017241379310346672,0.00017241379310346672,0.00017241379310346672,0.00017241379310346672,0.00017241379310346672,0.014477533321922404,0.00017241379310346672,0.00017241379310346672,0.41703020156564086,0.00017241379310346672,0.00017241379310346672,0.00017241379310346672,0.00017241379310346672,0.00017241379310346672,0.00017241379310346672,0.00017241379310346672,0.00017241379310346672,0.00017241379310346672,0.00017241379310346672,0.00017241379310346672,0.00017241379310346672,0.00017241379310346672,0.00017241379310346672,0.00017241379310346672,0.00017241379310346672,0.00017241379310346672,0.00017241379310346672,0.03574803691182986,0.00017241379310346672,0.00017241379310346672,0.00017241379310346672,0.03380132360031807,0.00017241379310346672,0.00017241379310346672,0.00017241379310346672,0.00017241379310346672,0.00017241379310346672,0.00017241379310346672,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
623,0,"As a professional poker dealer for over 25 years I found this movie very hard to watch . Too unreal . It seems the producers of this movie either had done little or no research or just did n't care . The card tricks are something you never would see performed in a real poker game . Common sense right ? Plus it was full of film cuts and such during the tricks . Who could n't do that ? The cheating was amateur stuff . Palming , marked cards , etc . Would you sit in a high limit game where they use opened deck cards ? Would you sit in a game where the players push their chips into the middle of a pot ( constantly ) , mixing them in then just verbalizing how much they bet ? C'MON ! I gave it a 4 because the twists and turns might be interesting to some people but for those who know how to play the game it will be pretty painful .

1210,0,"Very odd , this seems like a very average movie to me , if not slightly less . It is brilliantly shot but , together with the performance of R. Lee Ermey , that 's about the only redeeming aspect I found in the movie which consists of two separate parts . The first part covers the basic marine - training which , watching it in 2007 , comes off like something I 've see a zillion times before in dozens of other movies and series and it 's not particularly gripping . After 30 minutes I got the idea and wished they could just get on with it . The drill sergeant is about the only believable character while everyone else seem to be just cardboard cut - outs . The general acting is staggeringly haggard and the screenplay is devoid of anything interesting and consists of little more than the Sergeant shouting . The boys make it through their training and end up in Vietnam . Oh , and the fat weirdo shoots the sergeant ( what a surprise .. ) , probably in the mistaken belief that it was actually the scriptwriter . So , one hour passed and nothing worthy of note happened . Nothing ... Then we have the Vietnam - part . It opens with a bunk - scene where reporters of Stars and Stripes are bored and are making small talk to pass the time . At first I thought they were re - enacting some movie scenes from old films , it sounded pretty bad . But no , they were actually muttering their script lines . Then the camp is besieged . Some 20 Vietcong enter the camp through the main gate . Too bad for them they are being dropped like flies because they simply walk into several manned gun posts with no means of cover . Is that normal behaviour ? Were the Vietnamese all suicidal ? If so , how come the US did n't win this war during the first two months of engagement ? The rest of the movie continues with even more completely illogical war scenes . Furthermore , the whole plot is altogether pointless . None of the characters inspire much sympathy and the story is frankly rather uneventful . It shows little more other than some war - reporters hooking up with a platoon with some guys getting shot because they are disobedient morons and who also seem to think that somehow a gaping hole in a wall will protect you from bullets . What was the message of this movie .. that people died in Vietnam ? That people are animals in war situations ? That if you want to dispose of really dumb people , you send them to a war zone ? Or that somehow in Vietnam concrete can actually burn ? I 'm sorry , but if this movie deserves an 8.3 , then Apocalypse Now deserves a 38.35/10",500,0,0.04762710810546043,0.0002409638554217051,0.0002409638554217051,0.0002409638554217051,0.0002409638554217051,0.0002409638554217051,0.0002409638554217051,0.0002409638554217051,0.0002409638554217051,0.0002409638554217051,0.013045844275373466,0.0002409638554217051,0.0002409638554217051,0.0002409638554217051,0.0002409638554217051,0.0002409638554217051,0.0002409638554217051,0.0002409638554217051,0.036384320682570685,0.0002409638554217051,0.18437121232087747,0.49547628665439997,0.0002409638554217051,0.024379027105213544,0.01628710343385488,0.0002409638554217051,0.0002409638554217051,0.0002409638554217051,0.0002409638554217051,0.0002409638554217051,0.0002409638554217051,0.062256341919774284,0.0002409638554217051,0.0002409638554217051,0.0002409638554217051,0.0002409638554217051,0.0002409638554217051,0.0002409638554217051,0.0002409638554217051,0.0002409638554217051,0.0002409638554217051,0.0002409638554217051,0.014456053910898433,0.09607814737470868,0.0002409638554217051,0.0002409638554217051,0.0002409638554217051,0.0002409638554217051,0.0002409638554217051,0.0002409638554217051,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

1488,0,"Stumbled over this film on Amazon.com . Had never heard of its release but the three reviews gave it five stars and rave reviews so being a lover of German movies I bought a copy ... Have to say that I was not impressed . The production values are cheap , the story is derivative , the characters are less than engaging and for a comedy it is surprisingly short on laughs . I wanted to like this but I just found it lackluster and dull . Or maybe I expected more of independent German cinema than a gay spin on The Full Monty and a cast of stereotypes . There are bits in the film that make no sense at all , like one of the Leather Bear 's trying to get Ecki in a sling --like he 'd even look at him twice ?

1547,0,"This odd little film starts out with the story of Bruno ( Alex Linz ) in a catholic school who has no friends and gets beat up everyday . He likes to wear dresses and his obese mother Angela who is a dressmaker does n't think their is anything wrong with what her son likes . Angela complains to Mother Superior ( Kathy Bates ) but gets ignored and as the two of them walk back to they 're car they are harassed by the other kids and are pelted with eggs . Bruno 's father Dino ( Gary Sinise ) is divorced from Angela and is totally disgusted by his son being a sissy and practically disowns him . Bruno meets a new student at school named Shawniqua ( Kiami Davael ) who is a free spirit and dresses like Annie Oakley with cap pistols . Angela has a heart attack and Bruno 's grandmother steps in to take care of him when Dino refuses . The film starts out with a very hard and unsympathetic look at all the characters involved . Angela has a great deal to do with Bruno wearing dresses as she practically encourages him . Dino was told when he was a young boy by his mother that he was a sissy because he liked opera and now he refuses to help Bruno when he needs it . The catholic school that Bruno attends is very unruly and all the kids run rampant and even call Shawniqua the "" N "" word . Once Shirley MacLaine steps in the film shifts and becomes more family oriented ( So to speak ) . * * * * SPOILER ALERT * * * * The ending after the spelling bee is incredibly contrived and "" feel good "" . Hugs and cheers for Bruno as reporters follow him and take his picture for their papers . All the while Shirley MacLaine is acting like the "" tough old broad "" who snaps at everyone . There is one thing about MacLaine 's character in the film that no one has mention in these comments and it has to do with the masculine nature of her . I think the character of Helen might be a lesbian ! She 's very tough and strong and at one point in the film she shares a shot of whiskey with Bruno and smokes a cigar at the same time . I do n't remember anyone in the film mentioning who her husband was or if she was ever married at all ! This is why I think her character might be gay . Lots of other good actors appear in the film as well . Joey Lauren Adams , Jennifer Tilly , Brett Butler , Gwen Verdon and Lainie Kazan all should have taken a better look at the script before they signed on . I guess when they heard that MacLaine was directing that it would be an honor to be part of it . Very difficult to feel any remorse or understanding towards any of the characters and the subject matter is probably impossible for most to relate to . The actors are not bad but what exactly was MacLaine aiming for ? Tolerance towards a young boy who wants to wear dresses and freedom of expression ? We get that in the first 10 minutes , the rest of the time I was trying not to cringe .",582,0,0.0002197802197802431,0.0002197802197802431,0.0002197802197802431,0.0002197802197802431,0.022538780765542752,0.026293272824517204,0.0002197802197802431,0.0002197802197802431,0.0002197802197802431,0.0002197802197802431,0.0002197802197802431,0.0002197802197802431,0.0002197802197802431,0.0002197802197802431,0.0002197802197802431,0.0002197802197802431,0.05272720242964623,0.0002197802197802431,0.011202132869661468,0.011997505087065197,0.3021475442061854,0.035464208095133,0.0002197802197802431,0.0002197802197802431,0.05599048229882287,0.03940518502913037,0.0002197802197802431,0.0002197802197802431,0.0002197802197802431,0.0002197802197802431,0.0002197802197802431,0.0002197802197802431,0.0002197802197802431,0.0002197802197802431,0.0002197802197802431,0.0002197802197802431,0.0002197802197802431,0.0002197802197802431,0.0002197802197802431,0.0002197802197802431,0.0002197802197802431,0.09266231210338514,0.0002197802197802431,0.290536810612628,0.0002197802197802431,0.050682915326633333,0.0002197802197802431,0.0002197802197802431,0.0002197802197802431,0.0002197802197802431,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0

I was not familiar with the character , although after hearing some general stories about the style of the comic and good reviews of the movie , I thought I was in for a real treat ... From the moment that the lead character started to talk in his forced husky voice , I could tell straight away that I was not going to enjoy this movie . I found the story weak and predictable , the acting poor , the effects were very good for a small budget film , but did nothing for the overall plot .

2040,0,"A gut - ripping baby T - Rex is on the loose in a small western town , prompting sheriff Eric Roberts and animal control agent Melissa Brasselle ( who walks through her role in a very disinterest fashion ) to get to the bottom of things . They discover that a mad scientist ( Corbin Bernsen ) is , unbeknownst to the government sponsorship , continuing on with a long - abandoned US research project called Operation Jurassic Storm ( ha ! ) by creating an army of dinosaurs in a secluded underground lab facility . Before long , our heroes become trapped inside , the marines are called in , the power goes out and the dinos are set free to make a quick lunch of everyone they can get their claws and jaws on . Despite an often infuriatingly inept script full of plot holes , character inconsistencies and loose ends , this direct - to - video copy of JURASSIC PARK and CARNOSAUR is fairly digestible trash , thanks to good production values , passable FX , the occasional laugh and plenty of brainless action . Someone pointed out that an opening scene in this film was stolen from CARNOSAUR , but anyone used to watching Roger Corman productions knows he allows directors to liberally reuse clips from his early films to save both time and money .

2250,0,"What to say about "" Dead End Road"" ... Lets just say that Edgar Allen Poe would have been so ashamed . The acting , writing , effects , and everything in this movie was just horrendous . That does n't even do justice ! This movie was the biggest piece of garbage I have ever had to sit through . That is also why I stopped it about 20 minutes before the ending because personally I did n't care what happened to the characters . I have seen bad but this was definitely the worst .

2265,0,"A Chicago couple , Dillon and Dougherty , are falsely accused of killing their daughter . People begin to wonder if they did it . The police investigate and find suspicious evidence . The couple are maligned by the public and accused in the press . The cops speculate that they are Satanists and have ritually murdered their own daughter . They are charged and brought to trial . They are represented by publicity - seeking lawyers who give them bad advice and bill them for $ 100,000 . The evidence presented against them is twisted or hidden by the police . Fabricated intimations of sexual abuse are presented . Their other child is taken away from them and put in a foster home . Dougherty is pregnant and gives birth to find her baby removed . Verdict , she did n't do it but he did . He goes to the slams with a sentence of 45 years . In the last third of the movie , with Dillon in jail and Dougherty wondering what to do next , we see people who have been antagonistic now slowly coming to the couple 's defense . Witnesses admit to having lied . Other facts are brought to light that , finally , result in Dillon 's release . The killer is never found , though the movie gives us a thorough whacko as a plausible perp . This is a weeper from beginning to end . Nothing seems to go right for the couple . Oh , there are a few happy moment , maybe a party where everyone is glad to be together and tearing up with joy , or some point of evidence in their favor is discovered and people hug one another . But it 's never long before someone rushes through the door with more bad news and all the faces are frozen in tragic disbelief . ( Usually a fade to block follows . ) There is n't necessarily anything wrong with moving tragedies , although I ca n't imagine what pleasure we get out of seeing people suffer . There 's plenty of tragedy in Shakespeare too . I suppose whatever we find interesting about tragic stories lies in the way they 're told . "" Oh , but I am Fortune 's fool ! "" Romeo cries after killing Juliet 's brother . Here we have Dougherty running in her robe through a hospital corridor , screaming , "" Where 's my baby ? ? ? "" There is n't any ambiguity or irony in the story -- as I 'm sure there must have been in the real life events on which it 's based . People are either good or bad here . Or else they 're bad , then they turn good . The film is n't aimed at exploring human quirkiness , or the way things work out . It 's aimed at wrenching tears from the audience . The actors provide first - rate role models . I ca n't remember the last movie in which I saw so many tears . There are rivulets of tears . Showers of them . Cascades of them . A veritable Niagara of them . A Lake Lacrymose of them . Well , I 'll give one example of the efficiency with which the movie is crafted . Dillon and Dougherty hire a Chicago cop who works on the side as a private investigator ( Ed Asner ) . Asner is sympathetic to them but he does n't really accomplish much . He seems to be in the movie not because of his importance to the case but because he can provide the victimized couple with a kind of philosophy -- "" Learn to live with it , "" which is okay -- and because he suffers from colorectal cancer , so we can watch him take his medicine , double over with pain , and finally pass away . What 's frustrating about the movie is that in focusing so intensely on the suffering of the couple , it sidesteps one of the more important issues that it raises -- the function of gossip in regulating private lives . Gossip is a strange thing really . If we call it "" gossip "" it 's bad , but if we call it "" public opinion "" it sounds acceptable , at the very least . Of course we all have convictions about issues that may or may not be justified . ( As I write , Michael Jackson is once again being brought to court accused of molesting a young boy , and I wonder how many of us thrilled at the news and immediately assumed he was a pedophile . ) But gossip is n't all bad either . It 's like water . When it 's properly controlled it 's a community asset . We need gossip to keep each other in line . It helps us to maintain public order . But , like water in a flood or a tsunami , it is ruinous to a village when it rages out of control . This is a movie that 's okay if you 're not looking for too much in the way of insight into human nature . It 's done so cleverly that , given its goal , it 's hard to argue with it .",911,0,0.00017543859649124627,0.00017543859649124627,0.00017543859649124627,0.00017543859649124627,0.00017543859649124627,0.00017543859649124627,0.00017543859649124627,0.24015307010766773,0.00017543859649124627,0.00017543859649124627,0.00017543859649124627,0.00017543859649124627,0.037898365320500484,0.00017543859649124627,0.008947368384536601,0.00017543859649124627,0.06444680457211736,0.00017543859649124627,0.00017543859649124627,0.00017543859649124627,0.3104023085188306,0.00017543859649124627,0.00017543859649124627,0.00017543859649124627,0.016074825477127835,0.00017543859649124627,0.00017543859649124627,0.00017543859649124627,0.00017543859649124627,0.00017543859649124627,0.00017543859649124627,0.00017543859649124627,0.00017543859649124627,0.00017543859649124627,0.00017543859649124627,0.00017543859649124627,0.00017543859649124627,0.00017543859649124627,0.00017543859649124627,0.00017543859649124627,0.00017543859649124627,0.017883375359094955,0.01899189626274791,0.00017543859649124627,0.00017543859649124627,0.2780090035412355,0.00017543859649124627,0.00017543859649124627,0.00017543859649124627,0.00017543859649124627,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

And what 's with the Laurie going to war ? . i 'm OK with the fact that when a book is made into a movie there has to be some changes made , but not re - write the whole story . very very bad done .",168,0,0.0005555555555556085,0.0005555555555556085,0.0005555555555556085,0.0005555555555556085,0.0005555555555556085,0.0005555555555556085,0.0005555555555556085,0.0005555555555556085,0.028547050874395023,0.0005555555555556085,0.0005555555555556085,0.0005555555555556085,0.0005555555555556085,0.0005555555555556085,0.0005555555555556085,0.0005555555555556085,0.0005555555555556085,0.0005555555555556085,0.0005555555555556085,0.0005555555555556085,0.6774291759353761,0.0005555555555556085,0.0005555555555556085,0.0005555555555556085,0.04202679552989818,0.0005555555555556085,0.0005555555555556085,0.0005555555555556085,0.0005555555555556085,0.0005555555555556085,0.0005555555555556085,0.040096540598557426,0.0005555555555556085,0.0005555555555556085,0.08305867829858227,0.0005555555555556085,0.10439731431874415,0.0005555555555556085,0.0005555555555556085,0.0005555555555556085,0.0005555555555556085,0.0005555555555556085,0.0005555555555556085,0.0005555555555556085,0.0005555555555556085,0.0005555555555556085,0.0005555555555556085,0.0005555555555556085,0.0005555555555556085,0.0005555555555556085,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

He 's reached the point where you realize that his shtick has n't changed since his SNL days , over ten years ago . He 's doing the same cutesy stream - of - consciousness jokes and the same voices . His Cat is painfully unfunny . He tries way to hard . He 's some weird Type A comedian , not the cool cat he 's supposed to be . The rest of the movie is just as bad . The sets are unbelievably ugly --- and clearly a waste of millions of dollars . ( Cardboard cut - outs for the background buildings would have made more sense than constructing an entire neighborhood and main street . ) Alec Balwin tries to do a funny Great Santini impression , but he ends up looking and sounding incoherent . There 's even an innapropriate cheesecake moment with faux celebrity Paris Hilton --- that sticks in the mind simply because this is supposed to be a Dr. Seuss story .

3297,0,"I have read all of the reviews for this direct to video movie . I can agree that the movie is not "" Armageddon "" or "" Deep Impact "" quality . Nevertheless , if you are looking for a way to pass ninety minutes or so , then this is a movie that is bearable . I started looking at the film early in the AM hours as I was doing some geek stuff . It was very nice , because I was able to switch back and forth between what I was doing and watching the movie , with out missing a beat . It is a predictable movie , and the acting is not up to par for some of the veteran actors ( for instance , Dennis Hopper).But I should point out that I paid only $ 2 ( US ) and as the old adage goes : You get what you pay for ! If you are looking for some deep meaning movie that will have you have to watching it over and over again , then this is definitely the long video . On the other hand , if you looking for something to pass the time , then there is nothing wrong with Tycus ( Which incidentally was called "" Comet : Final Impact "" in Mexico where I found this video ) .",231,0,0.00045454545454549596,0.08460373030094108,0.030148751638357615,0.02174301233238041,0.00045454545454549596,0.00045454545454549596,0.00045454545454549596,0.00045454545454549596,0.00045454545454549596,0.00045454545454549596,0.00045454545454549596,0.00045454545454549596,0.00045454545454549596,0.00045454545454549596,0.00045454545454549596,0.00045454545454549596,0.00045454545454549596,0.00045454545454549596,0.02318034786481992,0.00045454545454549596,0.3157024871446782,0.049321940902245266,0.00045454545454549596,0.00045454545454549596,0.00045454545454549596,0.00045454545454549596,0.00045454545454549596,0.00045454545454549596,0.00045454545454549596,0.00045454545454549596,0.00045454545454549596,0.00045454545454549596,0.00045454545454549596,0.00045454545454549596,0.00045454545454549596,0.00045454545454549596,0.028382074987784705,0.00045454545454549596,0.00045454545454549596,0.00045454545454549596,0.00045454545454549596,0.00045454545454549596,0.00045454545454549596,0.00045454545454549596,0.056634617268556134,0.3716466739238711,0.00045454545454549596,0.00045454545454549596,0.00045454545454549596,0.00045454545454549596,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0
3584,0,"So after the initial disappointment of the first Final Fantasy movie , which seemed to bare next to no resemblance to the Final Fantasy series , Final Fantasy : Advent Children has released itself to a warm reception and , now , a dedicated fanbase . And the reason for the films success is understandable as it has lush graphics , fast moving fight sequences and some cool as hell characters . However , if you have n't played FF7 then it is likely that you will not enjoy this film as it 's storyline carries on from the game without previous explanation and your likely to get lost from the plot even if you have played the game . Secondly , there is no character development , without previous knowledge from the game your opinions on the characters are limited to ' cool ' and ' not cool ' . Of course , for FF7 fans the film is almost guaranteed to entertain , at least for nostalgic reasons , and it 's cool seeing all the characters you grew to love from the game rendered in some pretty amazing computer animation . One last complaint , the film , at least in my opinion , attempted to cram too much into less than two hours and therefore the last half hour or so seems horribly rushed . If you played and enjoyed FF7 than it is a worthwhile watch , though nothing too special . If you have not played FF7 then it is best that you play it first before watching this film .",267,0,0.0004000000000000331,0.0004000000000000331,0.0004000000000000331,0.024916434317606165,0.0004000000000000331,0.0004000000000000331,0.14855653316310055,0.0004000000000000331,0.0004000000000000331,0.0004000000000000331,0.0004000000000000331,0.0004000000000000331,0.0004000000000000331,0.0004000000000000331,0.02039061321431121,0.0004000000000000331,0.0004000000000000331,0.0004000000000000331,0.0004000000000000331,0.0004000000000000331,0.10095038686696464,0.0004000000000000331,0.0004000000000000331,0.045847582643735806,0.0004000000000000331,0.0004000000000000331,0.0004000000000000331,0.0004000000000000331,0.0004000000000000331,0.0004000000000000331,0.0004000000000000331,0.0004000000000000331,0.0004000000000000331,0.0004000000000000331,0.10373714597323673,0.0004000000000000331,0.0004000000000000331,0.0004000000000000331,0.0004000000000000331,0.0004000000000000331,0.07340424883510732,0.0004000000000000331,0.02093733462727863,0.3432125505114343,0.0004000000000000331,0.0004000000000000331,0.10204716984722328,0.0004000000000000331,0.0004000000000000331,0.0004000000000000331,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0

3846,0,"This movie is total dumbness incarnate . Yet , i 've seen this movie several times already and plan to watch several more times because , despite its sheer dumbness , it 's very entertaining . And it has one of my favorite hokey - movie actors , Casper van Dien , who is here in his full hokey - movie glory . Here , Casper van Dien is fully Casper van Dien , and ya got ta love him for it . If he had n't been in this movie , it would have been totally unwatchable dreck , or at least far dreckier than it already is . The ( cough cough ) "" science "" used here makes absolutely no sense at all . No one else in the world noticed that big asteroid approaching the Earth besides that small group ? Not even with thousands and thousands and thousands of professional and amateur astronomers constantly searching the skies for just such a thing ? An asteroid that big would have made itself completely obvious to anyone who has a pair of eyes even vaguely capable of sight . And a chunk of the asteroid bounced off the atmosphere and no one even noticed it ? A rock that big hitting the atmosphere would have caused enormous shockwaves that would have in turned caused an enormous amount of damage to the planet 's surface . Surely , someone would have noticed such a thing . Bwahahaha ! The "" science "" used in this movie is so completely ridiculous , that , somehow it works for making this movie as entertaining as it is . One thing i noticed is that despite the uber heat , all the characters were n't dripping with sweat and their clothes completely soaked with it . At the most , the characters looked like they had been lightly spritzed on occasion by someone off - camera with a water bottle to give a "" sweat sheen "" . Authenticity was * not * a goal that this movie assiduously and constantly strived for . Which , in a weird and hilarious sort of way , gives this movie its entertainment charm . Is this movie actually worth watching ? Definitely ! Assuming , of course , you have absolutely * no * expectations of anything that even remotely approaches reality . And , it 's your desire to wallow and luxuriate in total hokeyness at the moment .",417,0,0.0003225806451613174,0.0003225806451613174,0.0003225806451613174,0.0003225806451613174,0.0003225806451613174,0.0003225806451613174,0.0003225806451613174,0.0003225806451613174,0.0003225806451613174,0.0003225806451613174,0.0003225806451613174,0.0003225806451613174,0.00032258064516133646,0.0003225806451613174,0.0003225806451613174,0.0003225806451613174,0.0003225806451613174,0.0003225806451613174,0.0003225806451613174,0.0003225806451613174,0.7907160453169833,0.0003225806451613174,0.0003225806451613174,0.0003225806451613174,0.03919493253135841,0.0003225806451613174,0.0003225806451613174,0.0003225806451613174,0.0003225806451613174,0.07182457907814799,0.0003225806451613174,0.0003225806451613174,0.01749722693810669,0.0003225806451613174,0.0003225806451613174,0.0003225806451613174,0.0003225806451613174,0.0003225806451613174,0.0003225806451613174,0.0003225806451613174,0.0003225806451613174,0.0003225806451613174,0.017703746612186932,0.0003225806451613174,0.0003225806451613174,0.0003225806451613174,0.048869921136118544,0.0003225806451613174,0.0003225806451613174,0.0003225806451613174,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

I am not a Kiwi but I do know that the Haka can only be performed by someone of Maori origin and not by an all - American white boy . I am assuming that this was made for the American audience so the shallowness and "" Disney end ' "" is excusable but there was hardly any attempt to point out the basic rules of the game apart from the prison side where the main character suddenly takes charge of an American Football game and gets everyone playing rugby instead .

4518,0,"While I was watching this movie I never thought I 'd be defending it . It 's honest enough from the begininning about not having much of a plot . There 's no real characters to latch onto except the killer . Some of the acting can be better , but most of it is capable . I know , a three out of ten is n't stellar , but there are reviews saying it was shot poorly and completely useless , etc . I think it set out to do what it 's supposed to fairly well . The lighting is minimal at times , more natural than most audiences are used to , but it 's supposed top look like a camcorder snuff film . In fact , at times the quality is probably still too high to be true to that , but nobody would make it through tne minutes of camera work that 's truly that bad . It 's not particularly scary , but it is disturbing at times . There are one or two characters who do n't come across as believable at all and the soundtrack does get tiring at times , but overall it was put together cleaner than a lot of camcorder movies .",213,0,0.12682719287488595,0.0004444444444444738,0.04244286793227381,0.0004444444444444738,0.0004444444444444738,0.0004444444444444738,0.0004444444444444738,0.0004444444444444738,0.0004444444444444738,0.0004444444444444738,0.0004444444444444738,0.0004444444444444738,0.2422714243916698,0.0004444444444444738,0.0004444444444444738,0.0004444444444444738,0.0004444444444444738,0.0004444444444444738,0.02266007665672738,0.0004444444444444738,0.0004444444444444738,0.19995083018490686,0.0004444444444444738,0.0004444444444444738,0.0004444444444444738,0.04087733199767836,0.0004444444444444738,0.0004444444444444738,0.0004444444444444738,0.0004444444444444738,0.0004444444444444738,0.0004444444444444738,0.0004444444444444738,0.0004444444444444738,0.0004444444444444738,0.0004444444444444738,0.0004444444444444738,0.0004444444444444738,0.0004444444444444738,0.0004444444444444738,0.0004444444444444738,0.0004444444444444738,0.0004444444444444738,0.30585916485074566,0.0004444444444444738,0.0004444444444444738,0.0004444444444444738,0.0004444444444444738,0.0004444444444444738,0.0004444444444444738,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
4595,0,A man is builing a hotel with a partner . He finds out the hotel is over - insured . Things just get worse . This film has a huge mumber of scenes . They must have been put together in someones ' sleep . It jumps around from place to place . It does not stay focused on anything for very long . The ending starts on christmas morning with a hotel fire . It then cuts to a night scene of that fire and then cuts back to day time . The DVD sound track is horrible . It takes a fair plot and turns into the worst film I have scene in a long time .,119,0,0.0006896551724138482,0.252857734478129,0.0006896551724138482,0.03639738841883625,0.0006896551724138482,0.0006896551724138482,0.0006896551724138482,0.03712834633215031,0.0006896551724138482,0.0006896551724138482,0.0006896551724138482,0.0006896551724138482,0.11722281675447846,0.0006896551724138482,0.0006896551724138482,0.0006896551724138482,0.0006896551724138482,0.0006896551724138482,0.0006896551724138482,0.0006896551724138482,0.0006896551724138482,0.0006896551724138482,0.0006896551724138482,0.0006896551724138482,0.0006896551724138482,0.0006896551724138482,0.0006896551724138482,0.0006896551724138482,0.03580225254662011,0.0006896551724138482,0.0006896551724138482,0.0006896551724138482,0.0006896551724138482,0.0006896551724138482,0.0006896551724138482,0.0006896551724138482,0.0006896551724138482,0.0006896551724138482,0.0006896551724138482,0.0006896551724138482,0.0006896551724138482,0.0006896551724138482,0.0006896551724138482,0.49024663388357675,0.0006896551724138482,0.0006896551724138482,0.0006896551724138482,0.0006896551724138482,0.0006896551724138482,0.0006896551724138482,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

5058,0,"I have been living in Istanbul for 24 years and I ( a 39 years of experience would suggest ) do know what Istanbul has gone through all those years . Faith Akin is still quite young ( born in 1973 ) and falling in the great mistake of being ORIENTALIST when looking at Turkey ( just as his other movie Gegen Die Wand did ) This movie SERIOUSLY LACK contemporary urban Turkish life AND MISLEADS the audience when giving out ( quite false ) clues as to the geographical and cultural spreading of Istanbul . Anyone who could speak Turkish could easily attest that many underground bands & groups depicted in the movie ( Siyasiyabend for one ) are SO MISERABLE and their members can not even speak a proper language that they can not be taken as ' representatives ' of the contemporary Turkish music . Much less a piece of crap which many Turkish listeners even do not know about at all . We Turks have long been accustomed to ' superficious ' westerners who look at Turkey with some Orientalist point of view : trying to fit the actual Turkish image into their mind molds .. What is new in this movie is the fact that now a Turkish originated director ( Faith Akin ) is making the same mistake : Looking at Turkey with some false western glasses and scrambling to depict it as if he understands better . All of a vain effort . Just ask any Turkish friend of yours : What sort of a musical documentary is this without mentioning the names : Zeki Muren , Baris Manco , Ajda Pekkan , Teoman , Muslum Gurses , Ibrahim Tatlises , Ferdi Ozbegen ? .. and many others who have SHAPED so far the real MUSIC we are listening today?Faith Akin has a long long lesson to learn before babbling away and confusing other people 's minds with false images about the contemporary Turkish Music .",333,0,0.14559191137919808,0.11805186506033895,0.00038461538461541996,0.00038461538461541996,0.00038461538461541996,0.00038461538461541996,0.00038461538461541996,0.13003600361912263,0.00038461538461541996,0.00038461538461541996,0.00038461538461541996,0.00038461538461541996,0.00038461538461541996,0.00038461538461541996,0.01919696928400132,0.00038461538461541996,0.00038461538461541996,0.00038461538461541996,0.00038461538461541996,0.00038461538461541996,0.23932110976845286,0.00038461538461541996,0.00038461538461541996,0.020522144768459656,0.00038461538461541996,0.00038461538461541996,0.00038461538461541996,0.00038461538461541996,0.060473083770163055,0.00038461538461541996,0.00038461538461541996,0.00038461538461541996,0.012873774975071329,0.00038461538461541996,0.00038461538461541996,0.00038461538461541996,0.00038461538461541996,0.020096232012513336,0.00038461538461541996,0.00038461538461541996,0.11981869672773242,0.00038461538461541996,0.00038461538461541996,0.00038461538461541996,0.09901820863494504,0.00038461538461541996,0.00038461538461541996,0.00038461538461541996,0.00038461538461541996,0.00038461538461541996,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0
5129,0,"Why did I have to go out and buy ( yes buy ! ) JACK FROST 2 : REVENGE OF THE MUTANT KILLER SNOWMAN ? ? ? Maybe it was a burst of temporary mental derangement ? But I 'm guessing it 's because I kind of enjoyed the first JACK FROST . It was a silly but funny horror - comedy which had some okay effects by Screaming Mad George . That and the fact that on the back - cover of the sequel there was this nice picture of this guy impaled by this giant icicle ( coming out of his mouth with a lot of blood and all ) . So I thought : if it 's as idiotic as the first and has some nice splatter / gore in it , it should be fun , right ? Well , I was so dead wrong ! Let me first say that the movie deserves some credit for having an immensely insane and retarded plot . I mean , a mutant killer snowman on a tropical island that spawns mutant killer baby snowballs which can only be killed or harmed by bananas ? ? ? As much as I love the premise , I really hated the movie . First of all : while the first JACK FROST looked like an actual movie ( seemingly being shot on real film and all ) , this sequel has the look and feel of a third - rate soap - opera . It has this way too slick shot - on - video look . The lighting is just plain awful ( bright white spots for the day look , and stupid colors like blue and green at night ) . The acting ... well do n't even go there . The dialogues range from stiff to extremely senile ( that Jamaican man was just moronic , saying "" man "" after every sentence ) . And when it comes to the voice of the killer snowman , all I could think of was a seventh - rate Chucky from CHILD 'S PLAY spewing dumb and supposedly witty one - liners before he kills someone . The best joke was were one guy asks "" Why are you talking to your watch ? "" . And the best scene was undoubtedly the one with that beautiful Asian chick popping up out of nowhere and taking a swim in the pool totally naked ( thank god for that ! ) . Oh , yeah , and that little scene over the end - credits with those two Japanese dudes on a miniature ship being badly dubbed had me laughing too . But the worst thing about this movie was : Where was the gore and splatter action everyone is talking about ? There were plenty of occasions to show some decent gory killings . A lot of people were killed off in original ways here , but all off - screen . Like I 've read in many other comments , there were indeed nice set - ups to a head explosion , a crushed body , eyes being poked out , tongue ripped out , ... but on the crucial moments the editor cuts away to some blood splatters on the floor or nothing at all . That frontal shot of that British guy being impaled ( from the back - cover of the DVD ) was n't even in the movie . I only saw that particular killing filmed from the back ( meaning I did n't see sh!t ! ) . I was waiting throughout the whole movie for that to happen , and then I get to see nothing ? ! ? ! What a let - down ! Could it be that I saw a cut version of the movie ? That would be a shame , 'cause only a decent amount of splatter - fun could have saved this movie if you ask me . Seeing a lot of killer snowballs reduced to bloody pulp just did n't cut it for me . Speaking of those snowballs : they were done very poorly . They made MUNCHIES look like state - of - the - art ' animatronics ' . But I guess that was the whole point of it . At some point , the special effects crew even turned to some laughably bad CGI . Boy , you really have to see it to believe it . Best is to not see it , actually , 'cause this flick is just too bad ( okay , I did laugh with it , for it kept getting worse and worse ) . Just stick with the first JACK FROST ( 1996 ) and you 'll be okay ( just bare in mind that it 's a pretty silly horror - comedy but fun in it 's own right).It 's funny , but writer / director Michael Cooney somehow must have realized that he was a pretty bad director after JACK FROST 2 , and then focused on writing . Turns out he then wrote two pretty good thriller screenplays for THE I INSIDE ( starring Ryan Phillippe ) and IDENTITY ( starring John Cusack ) . So the man seems to have some talent after all . Now it would be far too easy to give JACK FROST 2 the lowest rating possible . So I say one point for that naked Asian babe doing the skinny dipping and one point for those completely retarded snowball babies . Way to go Mr. Cooney !",941,0,0.11701131975736728,0.00011764705882354184,0.00011764705882354184,0.00011764705882354184,0.00011764705882354184,0.00011764705882354184,0.018281156743060405,0.00011764705882354184,0.029010870512164694,0.00011764705882354184,0.024298020158674865,0.00011764705882354184,0.05172992214367602,0.00011764705882354184,0.00011764705882354184,0.00011764705882354184,0.00011764705882354184,0.025085091713394344,0.00011764705882354184,0.00011764705882354184,0.5850032905249043,0.05746462410492418,0.00011764705882354184,0.00011764705882354184,0.00011764705882354184,0.010406084941852403,0.00011764705882354184,0.00011764705882354184,0.00011764705882354184,0.00011764705882354184,0.00011764705882354184,0.006464131804709995,0.027606385309047948,0.00011764705882354184,0.00011764705882354184,0.006818591439584427,0.00011764705882354184,0.00011764705882354184,0.00011764705882354184,0.00011764705882354184,0.00011764705882354184,0.00618211447380708,0.00011764705882354184,0.00011764705882354184,0.022427358748801956,0.008093390565206075,0.00011764705882354184,0.00011764705882354184,0.00011764705882354184,0.00011764705882354184,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0
5136,0,"Jack Frost 2 was a horrible , terrible , sadly pathetic excuse for a sequal to a great movie . The original , was a low budget comedy horror film about a murdered who was turned into a snowman after an accident with some toxic waste . And the snowman went around murdering people , and avoiding blow dryers like the plague . This , however , was a far cry from the quality of the original . It seems like this even had a lower - budget because for some reason , after an hour into this film , I still had n't seen the snowman . Some revenge he 's getting if he 's always in the form of Ice cubes with a cheesy voice - over and a little shake of the cooler he rests in to give animation to the character . Disappointing to no belief , even for a fan of bad cinema .",159,0,0.0007142857142857634,0.0007142857142857634,0.03907374812839677,0.0007142857142857634,0.03852187165373646,0.0007142857142857634,0.0007142857142857634,0.0007142857142857634,0.0007142857142857634,0.0007142857142857634,0.0007142857142857634,0.0007142857142857634,0.0007142857142857634,0.0007142857142857634,0.0007142857142857634,0.0007142857142857634,0.0007142857142857634,0.0007142857142857634,0.0007142857142857634,0.0007142857142857634,0.6606488447390483,0.0007142857142857634,0.0007142857142857634,0.0007142857142857634,0.0007142857142857634,0.0007142857142857634,0.0007142857142857634,0.0007142857142857634,0.0007142857142857634,0.0007142857142857634,0.0007142857142857634,0.0007142857142857634,0.17601290196841515,0.0007142857142857634,0.0007142857142857634,0.0007142857142857634,0.0007142857142857634,0.0007142857142857634,0.0007142857142857634,0.0007142857142857634,0.0007142857142857634,0.0007142857142857634,0.0007142857142857634,0.05359977636754411,0.0007142857142857634,0.0007142857142857634,0.0007142857142857634,0.0007142857142857634,0.0007142857142857634,0.0007142857142857634,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
5349,0,"A depressed creepy teenager does many bad things to a socially active older lady who does not like to use shades or drapes in her windows . He steels assorted things from her , peeps at her , does prank calls , and plays assorted unpleasant tricks on her . Oddly , he keeps none of this a secret from her . At first , she does not seem to care one way or the other that he is bothering her . Then later she seems to begin to respect him for his cruel fevered activities . There are some illogical items to note . One is that the guy peeps into the night through a pane of glass from the more brightly lit side . In real life such a thing would not happen . The more brightly lit side of a pane of glass acts as a mirror . He would be able to see exactly nothing . Also , everyone out in the night would be able to look inside at him sitting in his well lit room . One other illogical item is that the creepy teen takes a job as a milkman , and his one and only customer each morning seems to be the lady he is picking on . Easy work , if you can get it . I saw A SHORT FILM ABOUT LOVE at a public showing . By the end , there was not a single open eye in the house . A SHORT FILM ABOUT LOVE is the foreign language movie for those who do not like reading subtitles . Not only are there very few words spoken in the film , but much of the movie is silent . A certain rest in peace .",297,0,0.18062598660570717,0.00039215686274513505,0.00039215686274513505,0.00039215686274513505,0.00039215686274513505,0.00039215686274513505,0.00039215686274513505,0.00039215686274513505,0.00039215686274513505,0.00039215686274513505,0.00039215686274513505,0.00039215686274513505,0.00039215686274513505,0.00039215686274513505,0.01999999999999926,0.00039215686274513505,0.14529632797728995,0.00039215686274513505,0.02000000000000029,0.08241835576855451,0.1263190380935491,0.00039215686274513505,0.00039215686274513505,0.00039215686274513505,0.00039215686274513505,0.10136642156943756,0.05812969764088552,0.00039215686274513505,0.00039215686274513505,0.00039215686274513505,0.00039215686274513505,0.00039215686274513505,0.00039215686274513505,0.00039215686274513505,0.00039215686274513505,0.00039215686274513505,0.00039215686274513505,0.03960784313724815,0.00039215686274513505,0.00039215686274513505,0.00039215686274513505,0.00039215686274513505,0.00039215686274513505,0.21055005469752308,0.00039215686274513505,0.00039215686274513505,0.00039215686274513505,0.00039215686274513505,0.00039215686274513505,0.00039215686274513505,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
5424,0,"I first watched this show hoping for a few laughs , good acting , and good plot . Sadly , I got none of those things . First off , this show is completely unrealistic . How can someone go to a boarding school that 's super hip , awesome location , and barely any rules ? Plus a sushi bar . A SUSHI BAR . No school has a sushi bar . And what 's up with the huge , ultra cool , ultra hip dorm rooms ? This does n't happen in boarding schools ! Everyone in this show seems to be perfect . Zoey , looks perfect , has the perfect friends , never has to do homework , and is super popular . Sounds more like a villain to me ! I hate how they use so many cliques in this show , Example : Dana the skater chick . She is completely ignorant and wears "" edgy "" clothes . The jokes are old sooooo old too ! I would n't watch this show if I were you , it 's one of the most horrible shows I have ever watched and I hope it gets canceled soon !

5441,0,"Just do a little research on the making of this film . Something so simple as a Google search . It was funded by the US Army and promoted just in time for the elections . It is a great idea , but I 'd much rather see a DOCUMENTARY , not something edited by the Bush Administration and told its reality . The timing of the movie 's release , its tone , and the fact that MS&L promoted it , raised questions about the intent of the movie . "" According to MS&L Managing Director Joe Gleason , he and his colleagues also deliver key targeted messages about the war in Iraq to specific constituencies , "" wrote Eartha Melzer . "" Was the left - leaning art house crowd one of those constituencies ? Is the government hiring documentary filmmakers to propagandize the U.S. population ?

María Lidón is n't a director , she is just a dumb woman that pretends that holding a camera with the hand and shout "" action "" makes her a professional film maker . What a mistake ! The movie itself is pointless and a total waste of good actors that could be doing something better in another project . Val Kilmer does nothing but place his face in front of the camera . His character do n't have specific weight in the movie . The same thing can tell about Joss Ackland , Vincent Gallo or Joaquim De Almeida . It 's a shame the way Rade Serbedzija 's character has been written . WARNING SPOILERSHe spends most of the time alone in the tunnels talking with himself in the way ( now I 'm doing this , now I 'm low of bats , I 'll search in my bag , now I 'm turning left , now I 'm turning right ... ) only to bring the audience a clear idea about his actions . It 's simply nonsense and proves the lack of talent of the director .

5488,0,"Some spoilers * * * * A Soap has some wonderful moments to recommend it . When Charlotte and Veronica get close to intimacy is a beautiful , low key , truly erotic scene . I also loved the music score and the soft , muted cinematography . I 'm not clear if the curious stop and start structure of the film comes from it being digested originally in serialized form ( the announcer describing the action in sections is quite annoying ) . My biggest problem with this film is its rather absurd depiction of a transwomen and her life . Of course , she has to be shown as a sexworker ( what else ) , scatterbrained , impractical , absurdly frilly / girly , completely hopeless when it comes to dressing and incapable of making any interpersonal attachments in the world . Moreover , she 's always shown with two days growth of beard ( for some bizarre reason ) as if to emphasize how tawdry her life is . And she 's waiting to get gender reassignment surgery when she seemingly has done nothing else to forward her transitioning . In truth , the character resembles a drag queen , not someone in the midst of transitioning . These are typical fantasies of people from the outside who really are n't connected to transpeople . The film 's fetishization of GRS surgery is a way of objectifying people who are going through transition . Not impressed with this aspect of the film in the least . At the very least , why not have the character played by someone who really is transgender ... I thought the male actor portraying Veronica was okay but no better than that . Much better was the woman portraying Charlotte , a very complex character full of energy , self - loathing , desire and contradictions . If she was so fascinated by someone with female energy , a Charlotte could go out to a women 's bar in two seconds and find it . Yes , she was drawn to Veronica but more as an abstract idea of someone with male / female characteristics ( a gentle touch but with a good punch ) , not as a unique person . Yes , what A Soap says about love is often lovely and moving , but that does n't mean an already stereotyped minority has to be stereotyped some more in the process . This film also proves that Danes are lousy dancers . For such a promising premise ( better executed in a film like "" Different For Girls "" ) the final film is a letdown .",450,0,0.30866965461792495,0.0003076923076923311,0.0003076923076923311,0.0003076923076923311,0.0003076923076923311,0.01599428880048009,0.0003076923076923311,0.10069293901976663,0.0003076923076923311,0.0003076923076923311,0.0003076923076923311,0.04268486064787426,0.0003076923076923311,0.0003076923076923311,0.0003076923076923311,0.0003076923076923311,0.0003076923076923311,0.0003076923076923311,0.0003076923076923311,0.0003076923076923311,0.0003076923076923311,0.056589224345551296,0.0003076923076923311,0.0003076923076923311,0.0003076923076923311,0.020276945916438964,0.0003076923076923311,0.0003076923076923311,0.03822311276209736,0.0003076923076923311,0.0003076923076923311,0.0003076923076923311,0.0003076923076923311,0.0003076923076923311,0.0003076923076923311,0.0003076923076923311,0.0003076923076923311,0.0003076923076923311,0.0003076923076923311,0.0003076923076923311,0.0003076923076923311,0.0003076923076923311,0.0003076923076923311,0.40394589696678873,0.0003076923076923311,0.0003076923076923311,0.0003076923076923311,0.0003076923076923311,0.0003076923076923311,0.0003076923076923311,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
5697,0,"This was a Hindi movie . Hindi = Horrible . reasons : cheap dialogues , cheap special effects , cheap directing + stretching a 2 hr max movie into 3 hrs . % ^^^^^^spoiler ... little bit%%%%%%%%Specifically for this movie : 1 . dialogues are not funny . they are cheesy , and cheap . Though akshay tried his best acting for which i admire him , comedy was not funny at all ! I laughed only 3 times during this movie . 2 . first half of the movie was useless to the story of the 2nd half . the 2nd half was the actual story / movie . the first half was time pass / build up . 3 . The characters are not developed properly at all . paresh rawal is smart in the first half , an idiot in the 2nd half / rest of the movie . we do n't really develop any feelings or caring for akshay , and govinda . their characters are stupid nothing more . they do not seem to struggle in their difficulties . Jokes are funny , but they are not funny in a very serious scene . the characters of the gang and the drug smugglers are cheesy and have been used in last 20 movies . there is nothing new about those characters . Again , they are shown to be stupid for being funny . however , stupid = funny when stupid is the norm throughout the whole movie . the only character that made sense was that of lara dutta with a real story . 4 . special effects were crap . at the end , ppl r fallin off the ladder of a fire truck . you notice that they are not actually on ladder in air . secondly , ppl start to fly off when the ladder starts to move around . ppl ca n't fly off a ladder when its moving ... they fall directly to the ground due to something called gravity . 5 . the whole movie was dubbed . all the dialogues were recorded after the movie . The actors ' lips hardly synced to the dialogues . There are probably many other reasons why this movie was crap , but i ca n't remember them . look at this masterpiece of crappy Indian movies by non - intelligent , even stupid , director yourself and you will agree with my review . ppl who like Hindi movies , please increase your expectations for decent quality in Hindi movies . Let me say that not all Hindi movies are bad . I like some . i did not like this one . 1.5/10 ( 1.5 for the effort by akshay and lara )",464,0,0.00021978021978023523,0.00021978021978023523,0.011573019210286375,0.00021978021978023523,0.00021978021978023523,0.00021978021978023523,0.04465331710022718,0.00021978021978023523,0.00021978021978023523,0.00021978021978023523,0.00021978021978023523,0.00021978021978023523,0.06731732713094424,0.00021978021978023523,0.06611775287762411,0.00021978021978023523,0.00021978021978023523,0.00021978021978023523,0.01120879120879015,0.00021978021978023523,0.6745696592539147,0.00021978021978023534,0.00021978021978023523,0.00021978021978023523,0.00021978021978023523,0.00021978021978023523,0.00021978021978023523,0.00021978021978023523,0.00021978021978023523,0.00021978021978023523,0.00021978021978023523,0.00021978021978023523,0.08959007402727587,0.00021978021978023523,0.00021978021978023523,0.00021978021978023523,0.00021978021978023523,0.00021978021978023523,0.00021978021978023523,0.00021978021978023523,0.00021978021978023523,0.00021978021978023523,0.00021978021978023523,0.00021978021978023523,0.025739289960167628,0.00021978021978023523,0.00021978021978023523,0.00021978021978023523,0.00021978021978023523,0.00021978021978023523,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0
5724,0,"Do n't be fooled by the other reviewers . Although this film contains an impressive array of talent , the material they present leaves a great deal to be desired . Nat King Cole 's 3 numbers are pretty lame and not even close to his later efforts , though he does impress with his piano playing . ' Moms ' Mabley is not a bit funny , though I remember her as a very entertaining talk show guest from my youth . Actually , the best performances are from a couple of fat guys who impress with a lively tap dance and a Four Tops takeoff , and the jazz band itself , especially in the number featuring the bass player . The print itself is pretty poor quality , and the wonderful Butterfly McQueen is totally wasted in the wraparound plot .",144,0,0.0007142857142857942,0.0007142857142857942,0.08090022308702595,0.0007142857142857942,0.17289842906666952,0.0007142857142857942,0.0007142857142857942,0.0007142857142857942,0.0007142857142857942,0.0007142857142857942,0.0007142857142857942,0.03642973448900398,0.0007142857142857942,0.0007142857142857942,0.0007142857142857942,0.0007142857142857942,0.0007142857142857942,0.0007142857142857942,0.0007142857142857942,0.0007142857142857942,0.20002980216306884,0.22319235666658843,0.0007142857142857942,0.0007142857142857942,0.0007142857142857942,0.0007142857142857942,0.03496158105127424,0.0007142857142857942,0.0007142857142857942,0.0007142857142857942,0.0007142857142857942,0.0007142857142857942,0.0007142857142857942,0.0007142857142857942,0.0007142857142857942,0.0007142857142857942,0.0007142857142857942,0.0007142857142857942,0.0007142857142857942,0.051136004460043835,0.0007142857142857942,0.0007142857142857942,0.0007142857142857942,0.10536542111133544,0.0007142857142857942,0.0658007336192723,0.0007142857142857942,0.0007142857142857942,0.0007142857142857942,0.0007142857142857942,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0

6071,0,"Summary : Not worth the filmAs an avid Gone With the Wind fan , I was disappointed to watch the original movie and see that they had left out many important characters . Luckily , the film on its own was a wonderful piece . When the book Scarlett came out , I read it in hopes of following two of my favorite literary characters farther on their journey together . While the book lacks any true quality , it remains a good story , and , as long as I was able to separate it from the original , was and still is enjoyable . However , I consider the six hours I spent watching the "" Scarlett "" miniseries to be some of the worst - spent hours of my life . Discrediting any of the original character traits so well - formed in Margaret Mitchell 's book , this series also turned the story of the sequel into one of rape , mistrust , murder , and misformed relationships that even the book Scarlett stayed away from . The casting for many of the characters refused to examine the traits that had been so well - formed in both the original novel and film , and even carried through in the second book , and again leaves out at least one incredibly crucial character . In the novel , Scarlett O'Hara Butler follows her estranged husband Rhett Butler to Charleston under the guise of visiting extended family . After coming to an "" arrangement "" with Rhett , she agrees to leave , and proceeds to reconnect with her O'Hara relatives in Savannah . Eventually , she accompanies her cousin Colum , a passionate leader of the Fenian Brotherhood , to Ireland , to further explore her family 's "" roots that go deep , "" and is eventually named "" The O'Hara , "" the head of the family . While her duties as The O'Hara keep her engaged in her town of Ballyhara , Scarlett ventures out into the world of the English landowners , and instantly becomes a sought - after guest at many of their parties . She , having been scorned by Rhett time and time again , eventually agrees to marry Luke , the earl of Fenton , until Rhett comes along in a clichéd "" night - on - white - horse "" - type of a rescue . The "" Scarlett "" miniseries fails even to do this justice . Raped by her fiancé and scorned by her family , the series shows Scarlett thrown in jail after she is blamed for a murder her cousin committed . I heartily advise anyone considering spending their day watching this to rethink this decision .",464,0,0.00029411764705885305,0.00029411764705885305,0.021034501066347595,0.043339465683448514,0.00029411764705885305,0.00029411764705885305,0.00029411764705885305,0.08491571700387489,0.00029411764705885305,0.00029411764705885305,0.00029411764705885305,0.014997434027620509,0.00029411764705885305,0.00029411764705885305,0.01644389412996082,0.00029411764705885305,0.00029411764705885305,0.00029411764705885305,0.00029411764705885305,0.00029411764705885305,0.055164200626728915,0.00029411764705885305,0.00029411764705885305,0.17205951284418405,0.02840451892046109,0.00029411764705885305,0.00029411764705885305,0.00029411764705885305,0.00029411764705885305,0.00029411764705885305,0.00029411764705885305,0.00029411764705885305,0.00029411764705885305,0.00029411764705885305,0.1761661337992558,0.01739013079830061,0.2503428527917373,0.01499999999812981,0.00029411764705885305,0.00029411764705885305,0.00029411764705885305,0.00029411764705885305,0.00029411764705885305,0.09385928536877268,0.00029411764705885305,0.00029411764705885305,0.00029411764705885305,0.00029411764705885305,0.00029411764705885305,0.00029411764705885305,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

6708,0,"With the plethora of repetitive and derivative sitcoms jamming fall , summer , winter and spring line - ups , it 's nice to see a show that sets itself from the lot in more than one area . ' Earl ' takes an unusual approach . It 's not about the "" daily musings of an eccentric family "" ( zzzz .. ) nor about the other boring stuff you see everywhere in sitcoms . The show is about this small - time white trash thief ( Earl ) who scratches off a lottery card and scores big time . Right at that moment , ' Karma ' took it away from him . Overtime , he learns that that unusual incident was probably because of all the bad things he 's been doing , so he sets off on a mission to right every wrong he ever did and he 's got all his deeds on a paper . This is a brilliant premise for a sitcom . Thankfully , it landed in the right hands . The execution of the show produces extremely satisfactory results : you get an innovative comedy that is genuinely funny and really touching at many times . You ca n't help but fall in love with Earl 's sincerity and steadfastness , Randy 's simple mind , good heart and observations on life , Joy 's wild , flamboyant personality and Darnell 's mellow , chillin ' demeanor that really endears him to you very easily . When you combine the show 's innovation with its genuine humor , good heart , interesting characters and well - written dialogue , you really have a keeper . With shows like this ( and the incomparable "" The Office "" ) , NBC is obviously on to something . Did they finally free a cubicle or two for quality assurance ? Let 's hope so . And let 's hope for more quality shows like these will occupy the line - ups ; shows that 'll make both us TV viewers and NBC executives stop crying over the long gone days of NBC 's golden days ( Frasier , Seinfeld , Friends )",369,0,0.000277777777777805,0.14252225951598507,0.06844875173160053,0.000277777777777805,0.000277777777777805,0.000277777777777805,0.000277777777777805,0.000277777777777805,0.000277777777777805,0.000277777777777805,0.000277777777777805,0.000277777777777805,0.07186379056412176,0.000277777777777805,0.000277777777777805,0.000277777777777805,0.000277777777777805,0.000277777777777805,0.000277777777777805,0.000277777777777805,0.3215082423992152,0.08176912117307404,0.000277777777777805,0.000277777777777805,0.07270933284071347,0.000277777777777805,0.000277777777777805,0.000277777777777805,0.000277777777777805,0.000277777777777805,0.000277777777777805,0.000277777777777805,0.000277777777777805,0.000277777777777805,0.04541804092381733,0.05134725619331264,0.000277777777777805,0.000277777777777805,0.000277777777777805,0.000277777777777805,0.000277777777777805,0.000277777777777805,0.000277777777777805,0.000277777777777805,0.11309582192435262,0.000277777777777805,0.02020627162269521,0.000277777777777805,0.000277777777777805,0.000277777777777805,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0
6755,0,"I love the so - called "" blaxploitation "" films and have seen dozens . Some , such as COTTON COMES TO HARLEM , SHAFT and HAMMER have excellent production values and are very entertaining , while many others are very cheap and silly , but still entertaining , such as BROTHERHOOD OF DEATH or COFFEY . However , DOLEMITE manages something rare for the genre -- it 's just cheap and silly and not the least bit entertaining ! It 's like blaxploitation made for very , very stupid people . Years ago , I saw a takeoff on the Dolemite films on "" Mad TV "" and unfortunately , the real DOLEMITE is n't any better . Like the parody , the acting is just atrocious . Rudy Ray Moore has all the charm and charisma of a piece of balsa wood . He can barely read his lines and his "" karate "" is a joke -- with his kicks obviously missing the target again and again . As for the rest of the actors , many might be even worse . My favorite was the FBI guy who could n't even remember his lines and really struggled to get them out -- yet they did n't even bother to re - film these scenes ! In fact , so much of it was inept that I had a hard time figuring out whether the film was intended as a joke . If you think that despite horrible acting and action that there is something worth seeing about this film , you 're wrong . Even for the perverts out there hoping to see some skin , will be disappointed . The naked women in the film really do look like hard - luck prostitutes and there 's nothing remotely sexy about their sagging bodies . I think looking at old people naked -- REEEAALLY old people naked -- is no worse than looking at these "" ladies "" . And as for Rudy Ray , he has "" man boobs "" . No Black super - hero or anti - hero should look that bad naked ! ! For goodness sakes , put on your clothes people and come up with a script that does n't look like it was written by winos!!!FYI -- Apparently , there are actually sequels to this film ! ! I ca n't imagine watching them , so you 'll just have to find someone else to review them . I have watched PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE , TEENAGERS FROM OUTER SPACE and ROBOT MONSTER , but I just do n't think I can bring myself to see another Dolemite film -- they are that bad !",457,0,0.0002061855670103283,0.0002061855670103283,0.0002061855670103283,0.0002061855670103283,0.024856230997684598,0.0002061855670103283,0.0002061855670103283,0.0002061855670103283,0.0002061855670103283,0.0002061855670103283,0.0002061855670103283,0.0002061855670103283,0.07728930603041305,0.0002061855670103283,0.0002061855670103283,0.0002061855670103283,0.0002061855670103283,0.0002061855670103283,0.0002061855670103283,0.0002061855670103283,0.3790996647481668,0.15074884060409824,0.0002061855670103283,0.027446561511748745,0.0002061855670103283,0.0002061855670103283,0.0002061855670103283,0.0002061855670103283,0.0002061855670103283,0.0002061855670103283,0.0002061855670103283,0.0002061855670103283,0.04039176528105133,0.0002061855670103283,0.0002061855670103283,0.012161251625516163,0.0002061855670103283,0.0002061855670103283,0.016341553784725783,0.0002061855670103283,0.03604185434067476,0.0002061855670103283,0.0002061855670103283,0.20615755404215103,0.021424179920366757,0.0002061855670103283,0.0002061855670103283,0.0002061855670103283,0.0002061855670103283,0.0002061855670103283,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0

ALL of post production is flawed , all of it . Whoever cut this film should be banned from the film industry . That aside , the script was a trainwreck . absolute rubish . Not to mention Jack Bauer and his Patchy the Pirate in Spongebob accent . WTF is his character doing there ? But to me , the biggest flaw of all was character development , intereaction , dynamics , dialogue . WOW . I ca nt believe how bad it was . I give this movie a 2 out of 10 . 1 for Samantha , who is a great actress , too bad the production made everyone look like amateurs out there.the other 1 goes to cinematography , which was indeed good .

7222,0,"Among the many accolades here for this production , there was one individual whose comments asked if he / she were the only one ( who was n't that enthralled by it ) - i.e. giving this film 3 stars . However , the comment went on to indicate an overall liking of the story , and other production of same . Well , this person is n't the "" only one , "" who did n't like this production ( include me ! ) but there I part company even with him / her . If you put a gun to my head and asked me to make a choice between your shooting me or watching this flick again , I 'd watch it , certainly - but I 'd probably spend 10 seconds thinking about it . I 'd much prefer being locked into solitary confinement , or having to watch paint dry on a wall , though . Further , I would n't want to see this story again , anytime , anywhere , or in any alternative presentation . Sometimes you feel like comedian George Gobel 's "" pair of brown shoes when the rest of the world is a tuxedo , "" and this is one of those for me . I liked Angela Lansbury in a favorite movie of mine , "" Long Hot Summer , "" and while not a huge fan of the show , enjoyed "" Murder , She Wrote . "" But HERE -- I not only did n't care for the story or other aspects , but I found Angela 's squealing , squawking , singing , and everything else about her over - the - top performance , perhaps the MOST ANNOYING presence in any movie ( or presentation in any other media ) I 've ever experienced . It was like an unending continuation of Audrey Hepburn 's equally "" over - the top "" Cockney chortling at Rex Harrison - in the earlier portions of "" My Fair Lady . "" But that was incident to the plot , presented for light , comedic effect , and ( mercifully ) brief . Unmercifully , this was anything but brief , and to me seemed as if it had gone - on for about 10 hours ( Einstein 's layman 's explanation of "" relativity "" at work . ) If I had n't been with friends , with the necessity to remain , MY viewing would have been brief . I laughed , though , at the "" Seinfeld "" episode where Elaine pisses everyone off because she tells them how much she disliked "" The English Patient .

7225,0,"The future of fantasy never looked so dark ! Christopher Lambert gets to fight the evil demon Grendel in this grim looking trashy fantasy - epos . "" Epos "" I said ? Er ... there 's only one location , so you ca n't really call it an epic adventure , can you ? The location is a medieval / futuristic 5 inch tall castle , so how did they manage to cram in all the actors ? Oh , I get it , those where special effects . A miniature . Silly me . Here 's some reasons why you might want or NOT want to watch this motion picture:- Lambert gets to do his sword - swinging tricks over again like he did in Highlander.- The sets and costumes are amazingly cool ( if you 're a 12-year - old).- Rhona Mitra has a voluptuous pair of knockers which she likes to show off through - out the whole movie.- ... er , Christopher Lambert has white hair ... - Every time they start fighting , this over - the - top raving techno - soundtrack gets going . So why are these medieval slayer - dudes fighting while they should be dancing.- They do n't have electricity in this castle but they do have speakers installed which seem to work fine . So where 's the amplifier ? I guess they borrowed it from the techno - dj who delivered the soundtrack.- Watch it for the climax in the end which features an outrageous demonoïd CGI creature coming straight out of any Playstation 2 survival - horror game . If all this got you interested , then go watch it ( at your own risk ) , but do n't tell anyone I told you to . I strongly suspect Pinhead visiting the set while shooting , because this movie has no soul . Anyway , if you want to see beautiful Rohna Mitra really show some skin , then watch Paul Verhoeven 's HOLLOW MAN .",341,0,0.00039215686274513364,0.00039215686274513364,0.00039215686274513364,0.00039215686274513364,0.00039215686274513364,0.00039215686274513364,0.08757219182038266,0.00039215686274513364,0.025064793250472523,0.00039215686274513364,0.023206139225722094,0.00039215686274513364,0.13026552695786905,0.00039215686274513364,0.00039215686274513364,0.00039215686274513364,0.11772634886906443,0.00039215686274513364,0.00039215686274513364,0.00039215686274513364,0.36380067125241583,0.00039215686274513364,0.00039215686274513364,0.08615710697538484,0.00039215686274513364,0.029178745424382133,0.00039215686274513364,0.00039215686274513364,0.00039215686274513364,0.02076826540733702,0.00039215686274513364,0.00039215686274513364,0.00039215686274513364,0.00039215686274513364,0.00039215686274513364,0.023870091152883317,0.00039215686274513364,0.00039215686274513364,0.05562448094200258,0.00039215686274513364,0.00039215686274513364,0.00039215686274513364,0.00039215686274513364,0.00039215686274513364,0.00039215686274513364,0.00039215686274513364,0.021863677937768396,0.00039215686274513364,0.00039215686274513364,0.00039215686274513364,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
7592,0,"This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen . The highlight of the movie is a comparison between the smell of natural gas and a dirty vagina . The acting is pathetic . I know acting is hard work and stuff , but that 's why it should be left to real actors . Watching these people act is like watching Michael J. Fox perform brain surgery . It 's shaky at best . One of the other comments would have you believe that the movie is saved by the acting talents of Dan Gordon as Chris . Only Dan himself or maybe his mother could believe that was good acting . The special effects in this movie were terrible . The worst special effects were for the gas explosion in the lighthouse . It looked like someone was shining an orange light up from the bottom of a model constructed from a refrigerator box . Sure there was a little bit of computer animation layered over top , but it did n't help . I suspect that the special effects on this movie were created and rendered using a single Amiga computer from the late 80s .",201,0,0.0003921568627451292,0.0003921568627451292,0.0003921568627451292,0.08291072431329387,0.0003921568627451292,0.0003921568627451292,0.16089088922327122,0.0003921568627451292,0.0003921568627451292,0.0003921568627451292,0.0003921568627451292,0.0003921568627451292,0.12291311766167551,0.0003921568627451292,0.0003921568627451292,0.0003921568627451292,0.0003921568627451292,0.0003921568627451292,0.0003921568627451292,0.0003921568627451292,0.4061274720131282,0.14184588999141254,0.0003921568627451292,0.0003921568627451292,0.0003921568627451292,0.0003921568627451292,0.02481462960327654,0.0003921568627451292,0.0003921568627451292,0.0003921568627451292,0.0003921568627451292,0.0003921568627451292,0.0003921568627451292,0.0003921568627451292,0.0003921568627451292,0.0003921568627451292,0.0003921568627451292,0.0003921568627451292,0.0003921568627451292,0.0003921568627451292,0.0003921568627451292,0.019999999999997874,0.0003921568627451292,0.0003921568627451292,0.0003921568627451292,0.0003921568627451292,0.024026688958648706,0.0003921568627451292,0.0003921568627451292,0.0003921568627451292,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

Naturally things outside of the race start to take over priorities , they get mixed up in a diamond robbery and Herbie falls in love with another car ! . The car stunts are of course pleasant and easy on the eye , and it would be churlish of me to really vent venom on such a friendly piece of fluff , it 's just that the film goes nowhere fast and personally now i can see it for the coin motivated piece of work it is .

7861,0,"I do n't understand the many good reviews , here . I found the photography and scenery beautiful , and the two lead actors appealing , but there 's little else here to recommend this movie . Most annoying are the fake Southern accents and badly written dialog . These do not sound like real people to me . Although it 's refreshing to show men exploring various forms of sexuality without the usual labeling and stereotypical character traits , most of the story is without motivation or logic . The only thing that makes very much sense is the responsibility Griffith feels toward his mentally ill Aunt , grossly over - acted by Karen Black . Lee is an interesting character who would have been more compelling had the dialog he was made to speak been more natural and his motivations more clear . Yes , I understand that he 's a drifter , but his actions as the movie draws to a rushed conclusion make no sense at all . This movie is worth a look , chiefly because it has a nice atmosphere about it , but it 's slow moving and deeply flawed . A serious rewrite and better editing might have saved it , as the premise and story outline are promising .",218,0,0.22414811648107064,0.0005555555555556107,0.0005555555555556107,0.0005555555555556107,0.0005555555555556107,0.0005555555555556107,0.0005555555555556107,0.05287652457244864,0.0005555555555556107,0.0005555555555556107,0.0005555555555556107,0.0005555555555556107,0.0005555555555556107,0.0005555555555556107,0.0005555555555556107,0.0005555555555556107,0.0005555555555556107,0.0005555555555556107,0.0005555555555556107,0.0005555555555556107,0.2142655024404802,0.24467941085503464,0.0005555555555556107,0.0005555555555556107,0.0005555555555556107,0.0005555555555556107,0.0005555555555556107,0.0005555555555556107,0.032632358000862394,0.0005555555555556107,0.0005555555555556107,0.0005555555555556107,0.0005555555555556107,0.0005555555555556107,0.17833382274562534,0.029175376015586875,0.0005555555555556107,0.0005555555555556107,0.0005555555555556107,0.0005555555555556107,0.0005555555555556107,0.0005555555555556107,0.0005555555555556107,0.0005555555555556107,0.0005555555555556107,0.0005555555555556107,0.0005555555555556107,0.0005555555555556107,0.0005555555555556107,0.0005555555555556107,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

8022,0,"My mom and I went to see this film because my brother is serving in the U.S. Peace Corps in the same region in which it 's set . Halfway through the film , I decided that given its failure to measure up to what it pretends to accomplish , the title is pretentious . The subject it deals with could have made for an excellent documentary , but because of its poor execution , it left me far less educated about the issue than I had hoped to become . I agree with laura - jane from Canada ( "" Powerful Message but Lacks Focus . "" ) . I also agree with the user who commented that this filmmaker 's narration - free style is the opposite of that of Michael Moore , but I do n't agree that it presents varying points of view and invites the viewer to decide for him- or herself . I do agree with one user 's comment that "" a lesson is better learned when we draw the conclusions ourselves "" ; however , our conclusions ca n't be anything but poorly founded if we are presented with little relevant information from which to draw them . The main points of the documentary seemed to be that 1 ) The African people who live near Lake Victoria are very poor and suffer greatly . 2 ) The introduction of perch to Lake Victoria , inflicted by Europeans , ruined its ecosystem . 3 ) The communities surrounding Lake Victoria are financially dependent on the perch economy . The best things I can say about the film is that it attempted to relate the perspectives of the average people in sub - Saharan Africa , which , unfortunately , is an anomaly among films , and that it attempted to portray poverty as the result of a dysfunctional economic system rather than a universal , inevitable phenomenon . I liked the irony it captured in the massive amount of fish leaving the country in the face of a famine . I appreciated the portrayal of how out of touch the U.N. team assigned to the region was with the people . Like almost all documentaries that do n't have the word "" women "" in the title , this film fails to do a good job representing women 's voices -- the majority of the talking done in interviews is that of men . Maybe I need to watch the film a second time in order to catch some key points I might have missed , but I failed to detect Sauper 's theory of the relationship between the introduction of perch to Lake Victoria and the unjust living conditions for Africans living near the lake . Furthermore , I could be wrong , but it struck me that Sauper could do well to improve his interview skills . Not only did the questions he asked and the responses he included seem to be arbitrary , but he seemed to have a real knack for making interviewees awkward and uncomfortable . The most compelling development in the film is the suggestion that the exportation of perch now functions to mask the importation of arms and that the real economy screwing over Tanzanians is that of war , not fishing . Sadly , Sauper shies away from conducting a thorough expose of the idea ( or at least extending the interview with the reporter who seemed to know what he was talking about in regards to the weapons importation ) and cops out with a "" decide for yourself "" approach . If Darwin 's Nightmare was meant to dispel the myth that first world exploitation of the third world gives them "" a chance for a better life , "" it did n't do a good job of it . If it was meant to depict how the weapons manufacturing industry in the U.S. and Europe is responsible for much armed conflict around the world , it did n't do a good job of it . If it was meant to portray what drives people to prostitution , it did n't do a good job of it .

8057,0,""" Thunderbolt "" is probably Jackie Chan 's worst movie since "" The Protector "" in 1985 . Yes , I know that nobody watches his movies for their stories , but the plotting of this one is unusually lame , even by his standards , and while the fight choreography IS up to his standards , the fight scenes ( the whole two of them ) are ruined , as others have mentioned , by the frenetic , distracting camerawork . Even the most serious Jackie Chan fans should n't really bother with this offensively haphazard , stunt - and - plug - filled garbage . Anita Yuen 's cute and perky performance is one of the few redeeming virtues . For a good "" serious Jackie "" movie , I recommend "" Crime Story "" .

8194,0,"The dominating conflict is between a couple of fine actors ( Huppert and Dutronc ) and the horrible script . Evidently , the actors lost , since the director / screenwriter Claude Chabrol eventually forced the leading couple to follow this worthless piece of sick imagination to the letter . Fortunately , the powerful performances by Huppert and Dutronc dramatically improve the overall quality of the movie , which miraculously gains the depth and humor . As for Chabrol 's persistence in keeping the film bland and illogical , it reaches the climax in the final scene , which is so incredibly poor that you will wonder which pills he was taking himself while directing it .",117,0,0.0010000000000000772,0.0010000000000000772,0.13846030604508092,0.0010000000000000772,0.0010000000000000772,0.0010000000000000772,0.0010000000000000772,0.0010000000000000772,0.0010000000000000772,0.0010000000000000772,0.0010000000000000772,0.0010000000000000772,0.0010000000000000772,0.0010000000000000772,0.04702406465632448,0.0010000000000000772,0.0010000000000000772,0.0010000000000000772,0.0010000000000000772,0.0010000000000000772,0.30262140288623957,0.0010000000000000772,0.0010000000000000772,0.0010000000000000772,0.0010000000000000772,0.0010000000000000772,0.0010000000000000772,0.0010000000000000772,0.0010000000000000772,0.0010000000000000772,0.0010000000000000772,0.0010000000000000772,0.0010000000000000772,0.0010000000000000772,0.0010000000000000772,0.0010000000000000772,0.0010000000000000772,0.0010000000000000772,0.05603096273511393,0.0010000000000000772,0.0010000000000000772,0.0010000000000000772,0.0010000000000000772,0.31348231922812636,0.0010000000000000772,0.09838094444911152,0.0010000000000000772,0.0010000000000000772,0.0010000000000000772,0.0010000000000000772,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,1

Gary Busey was creepy as an army LT .",128,0,0.0012500000000000714,0.0012500000000000714,0.0012500000000000714,0.0012500000000000714,0.0012500000000000714,0.0012500000000000714,0.0012500000000000714,0.13667262014888526,0.0012500000000000714,0.0012500000000000714,0.0012500000000000714,0.0012500000000000714,0.0012500000000000714,0.0012500000000000714,0.0012500000000000714,0.0012500000000000714,0.0012500000000000714,0.0012500000000000714,0.0012500000000000714,0.0012500000000000714,0.0012500000000000714,0.1181648123200002,0.0012500000000000714,0.1704816737349897,0.0012500000000000714,0.0012500000000000714,0.0012500000000000714,0.0012500000000000714,0.0012500000000000714,0.0012500000000000714,0.0012500000000000714,0.0012500000000000714,0.07040402178480994,0.0012500000000000714,0.0012500000000000714,0.0012500000000000714,0.0012500000000000714,0.0012500000000000714,0.0012500000000000714,0.0012500000000000714,0.0012500000000000714,0.0012500000000000714,0.0012500000000000714,0.4480268720113118,0.0012500000000000714,0.0012500000000000714,0.0012500000000000714,0.0012500000000000714,0.0012500000000000714,0.0012500000000000714,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
8411,0,"Not a terrible movie ... But there are monster scenes where you will be rolling on the floor laughing - not a good thing for a action / thriller . The acting is generally pretty decent for a SciFi channel movie . Barry Corbin plays a credible US senator , and Lou Diamond Phillips again gives us a decent military / police / sheriff / agent / marshal figure . The special effects are well , "" special "" - for example , the external train shots are very obviously a model train . Goofs : A meteor strikes a stationary car in the opening scene . The car bursts into flames but does not budge an inch . After the impact , the meteor is lodged in the top of the car 's hood - impossible from the low angle that the meteor came in at . Spoilers ... A good portion of the movie 's events are predictable , from the helicopter crash ( "" Pull up , pull up ! "" ) , to the fact that the annoying people get it in the end , to the classic blown bridge over a 1000 foot gorge awaiting the train , to the sequel set - up at the end . The scenes showing the aliens attacking are hilarious . They are vicious cute puppets and move at lightening speed - remember the Monty Python rabbit ? Spoiler Goof : In one scene four people shooting clip after clip can not hit a single creature because they move at lightning speed . Later in the movie Todd Bridges rigs up a mini flame thrower which he uses to dispatch a number of creatures at close range . On several occasions , Lou Diamond Phillips is able to easily grab creatures with his bare hands .",307,0,0.0004347826086956988,0.0004347826086956988,0.0004347826086956988,0.022173913043475796,0.0004347826086956988,0.0004347826086956988,0.07238909242428573,0.0004347826086956988,0.0004347826086956988,0.0004347826086956988,0.0004347826086956988,0.0004347826086956988,0.0004347826086956988,0.0004347826086956988,0.0004347826086956988,0.0004347826086956988,0.0004347826086956988,0.0004347826086956988,0.0004347826086956988,0.07937923263147476,0.20499736492602366,0.34479348814002675,0.0004347826086956988,0.0004347826086956988,0.0004347826086956988,0.01926961508686225,0.06449996884261988,0.0004347826086956988,0.0004347826086956988,0.0004347826086956988,0.0004347826086956988,0.0004347826086956988,0.11803251295702849,0.0004347826086956988,0.0004347826086956988,0.0004347826086956988,0.0004347826086956988,0.0004347826086956988,0.0004347826086956988,0.0004347826086956988,0.0004347826086956988,0.0004347826086956988,0.0004347826086956988,0.0004347826086956988,0.0004347826086956988,0.05663872499167913,0.0004347826086956988,0.0004347826086956988,0.0004347826086956988,0.0004347826086956988,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

8830,0,"If anyone thinks this is a great sports movie it is probably the only sports movie they have ever seen . There are different aspects a sports movie can take . Whether it be professional or college or high school . Examples of sports movies I liked ( and I have n't seen many ) are Jim Thorpe : All American , All the Right Moves , Any Given Sunday , Eight Men Out , and Rocky , among others . All of those movies had a little more than just plain sports . Whether it was a mans ascent and then descent from greatness , or a man losing out on a dream by the actions of a vindictive coach , or the effect of money on professional sports . In Hoosiers , there is not much content . It did n't even seem as though the movie had a beginning or an end . There was no character development , all of them were forced on us . I could sum up this movie , by quoting a very bad coach : "" Go out and try to score more points than the other guy .

8898,0,"First of all , Katherine Hepburn is badly miscast as Clara . She just ca n't be convincing as the devoted , selfless , rather smarmy wife that the writers have created . But the real weakness of the film is its shallowness in the face of a potentially great piece of drama . Schumann 's bipolar ( manic - depressive ) disorder amounts to "" Oh , oh , I have a headache "" and the occasional angry word . Suicide ? The word is used , but there 's no sign of it in domestic scenes and when we see him in the mental hospital he 's calm and subdued and smiling and optimistic . A superficial treatment . And Brahms is so upright and bourgeois - no sign of his gruff humour , his love of tweaking the noses of the establishment , no sign of his tortured attitude toward sex and women resulting from spending his youth playing piano in brothels . And was Clara 's long concert career entirely about promoting Robert 's music , or was she , in fact , a remarkable pianist who wanted a career for herself , a female pianist carving out a place for herself in a male world ? Any sort of treatment of the lives of great artists is better than none , but this is a standard Hollywood , middle - of - the - road approach , particularly disappointing because the real story is so much more dramatic , so much more interesting , so much more human .",264,0,0.0005555555555556072,0.0005555555555556072,0.0005555555555556072,0.0005555555555556072,0.04206415973602103,0.0005555555555556072,0.0005555555555556072,0.2744350158901987,0.0005555555555556072,0.0005555555555556072,0.0005555555555556072,0.0005555555555556072,0.17670244342274946,0.0005555555555556072,0.02211513244415662,0.0005555555555556072,0.0005555555555556072,0.0005555555555556072,0.0005555555555556072,0.0005555555555556072,0.0005555555555556072,0.0005555555555556072,0.0005555555555556072,0.0005555555555556072,0.0005555555555556072,0.0005555555555556072,0.0005555555555556072,0.0005555555555556072,0.06379057061711087,0.0005555555555556072,0.0005555555555556072,0.0005555555555556072,0.0005555555555556072,0.0005555555555556072,0.1364687219950015,0.02955312785064929,0.0005555555555556072,0.0005555555555556072,0.0005555555555556072,0.0005555555555556072,0.0005555555555556072,0.0005555555555556072,0.0005555555555556072,0.23153749471077678,0.0005555555555556072,0.0005555555555556072,0.0005555555555556072,0.0005555555555556072,0.0005555555555556072,0.0005555555555556072,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

The plot , the story of a post - Apocalyptic roller blading samurai warrior , is a convoluted hodge - podge of film references of everything from STAR WARS to THE SEVEN SAMAURI . The acting fluctuates from bland to abysmal . The scene where the villain tempts the old master is embarrassing to the point of jeering laughter .

9509,0,"In reality that happened : the royal mother in law and father in law lunched with the couple the day after the wedding and gave her the money in public . This troubled young Elisabeth so much that she never forgot the issue . We must remember she was only 16 . She was so embarrassed that she kept a fear for sex all her life . Perhaps this began to appear as a trauma . Also the constant meddling of her aunt and mother in law . As you say , she kept all her children away from her , critiqued her teeth and manners ( which she considered inappropriate for an empress ) , and when Sissi finally went to Venice with her husband and children , her eldest daughter died , and the mother in law blamed her for that unfortunate and premature death . She never recovered .",152,0,0.0008333333333333863,0.0008333333333333863,0.0008333333333333863,0.0008333333333333863,0.0008333333333333863,0.0008333333333333863,0.0008333333333333863,0.1315676010573249,0.0008333333333333863,0.0008333333333333863,0.0008333333333333863,0.0008333333333333863,0.0008333333333333863,0.0008333333333333863,0.0008333333333333863,0.0008333333333333863,0.0008333333333333863,0.0008333333333333863,0.0008333333333333863,0.0008333333333333863,0.0008333333333333863,0.0008333333333333863,0.0008333333333333863,0.0008333333333333863,0.0008333333333333863,0.0008333333333333863,0.0008333333333333863,0.0008333333333333863,0.0008333333333333863,0.0008333333333333863,0.0008333333333333863,0.0008333333333333863,0.24239392817259633,0.0008333333333333863,0.10695669517593288,0.04251210177671511,0.0008333333333333863,0.0008333333333333863,0.0008333333333333863,0.04285921040097669,0.1379059659195588,0.2599711641635597,0.0008333333333333863,0.0008333333333333863,0.0008333333333333863,0.0008333333333333863,0.0008333333333333863,0.0008333333333333863,0.0008333333333333863,0.0008333333333333863,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

9650,0,"LTL is the kind of formulaic , hopeless comedy to be enjoyed by the sort of sheep that stop and listen when they come across a band playing in a shopping mall . I remember Murray promoting LTL on Larry King 's crappy CNN show , where he said something like "" if this movie does n't become a hit I 'll stop making movies ( or comedies ) "" . He was n't being nearly as jovial as one might think ; he must have felt that LTL was a sure - fire hit and that its failure would mean his status as a star had markedly fallen - hence a sort - of ultimatum live - on - air to his fans to spend their hard - earned money on a dumb elephant comedy . ( The comedy being dumb , not the elephant ... ) Or maybe he simply realized during the shooting ( or when he saw the final cut ) what a turkey this was , so he tried desperately to convince everyone how much optimism he had regarding LTL 's quality . "" Go see it , it really is good ! "" Actors are prostitutes inter - bred with car salesmen . LTL is the sort of lousy project that comes from the "" Friends "" school of comedy ; their motto : "" If you ever run out of ideas - or if you never had any in the first place - then stick an animal into the plot and that will at least inject an element of cuteness "" . Cuteness = a sad substitute for lack of funny gags . The other motto "" Friends "" had was : "" always include pointless , dull sentimentality "" , which this movie so predictably ends with , when Murray rather pathetically says : "" what they forgot to tell you is that you never forget an elephant "" . Maybe not an elephant , but I certainly managed to easily forget this turkey , which I saw many years ago . I was suddenly reminded of it when I saw a scene from it on TV today ( hence this equally pointless review).Murray wastes his talent on this turkey ( disguised as an elephant ) , but he is n't nearly as uninteresting / bad as McConaughey ( or however that man 's name is spelt ) ; one would think that M.M. would have an easy time playing himself , i.e. a hick , but he is so painfully unfunny and unconvincing that I could barely stand to watch him make such a jackass out of himself . It was cringe - worthy . To round off this nonsense , we have that generation - X buffoon , Garofalo , in a rather useless role . Then again , everything about LTL is useless ... After LTL , which bombed as far as I know , Murray went on to become more of a "" serious actor "" . What is it with these comedians and their inferiority complex ? Is it all just about getting awards , i.e. "" recognition from their peers "" ( read : votes from their moron colleagues ) ? This piece of crap marked the end of a string of good and great movies Murray made in the early- and mid-90s , such as "" Groundhog Day "" , "" Quick Change "" , "" Mad Dog & Glory "" , "" Kingpin "" , "" What about Bob ? "" and "" Ed Wood "" . Recently we 've had the immeasurable pleasure of seeing him in garbage / mediocrities such as "" Hamlet "" , "" Lost In Translation "" ( you just ca n't get away from these "" ultra - talented Coppolas "" ) , and "" Broken Flowers "" . Compare those two batches . One guy described LTL "" funny as heck "" . Now THAT 'S the kind of audience this movie was hoping for ...

9942,0,"This movie was one of the worst I 've ever seen , it did not left out a single clichee one could imagine about a Hollywood - so - called - Thriller . The protagonist is a loving father & a private investigator who is engaged in a special task : finding out if a suspected "" snuff "" movie is real . Certainly , he get 's involved deeper & deeper , smeary pornoshops ( run by mexicans ) & sex theatres are his field of investigation as he 's searching for the murderers of the woman in the "" snuff "" movie . Assisted by a "" smart "" ( he read a book ) sexshop employee , he 's catching up with a murderous bondage - film producer and his personal perverts who are responsible for the film ... ... and what do you expect ? They are portrayed as the simple evil , no need for explanations , backgrounds , history : they are the bad ones , and he 's the purifier . Boom . Killer of the killers . End of film . Is it that bad ? Yes , I 'm afraid so . Ironically , "" machine "" ( the mega - pervert who did the killing ) is even pointing at his ridiculous character : In the last scene , our hero forces "" machine "" to put off his leather mask ( yep , of course he 's wearing one ) and recognizes that "" machine "" looks just like the normal 08/15 guy from the street . Then "" machine "" says : "" blablabla I 'm not a monster , my parents never abused me , I had a nice childhood , I just love to do what I do!""I just love to kill people . Yeah , sure , "" everybody loves killing people "" ( Bender ) . It 's not only the total lack of character what made this film so boring , it 's also it 's ugly "" I have to kill these people""-attitude which makes you sick . In one scene , our hero has tied up one of the killers and tries to shoot him ... but he ca n't . So what does he do ? He calls the mother of the killed woman , says that her child is killed and asks her whether she loved her child so much that she wishes to see the killers dead . The mother cries yes , she 'd love her child , he goes back to the tied killer and slaughters him . To come to the point : This film is breathing the foul air of lynchmob - supporters ( certainly the police does not play any role in it ) , moralizes in a ridiculous form against pornography , does not take it 's characters serious and wastes your time with a stupid plot . Probably the only good thing about this film is that it does not try to pseudo - psycho - analyze ... even that would be too much plot . Don't waste your time with this .",532,0,0.00020408163265308178,0.00020408163265308178,0.00020408163265308178,0.00020408163265308178,0.05359358870358764,0.0077725583143597255,0.010856609617474207,0.00020408163265308178,0.00020408163265308178,0.00020408163265308178,0.00020408163265308178,0.00020408163265308178,0.15907745667686532,0.00020408163265308178,0.00020408163265308178,0.00020408163265308178,0.029964785234455633,0.00020408163265308178,0.00020408163265308178,0.00020408163265308178,0.45477094914672334,0.00020408163265308178,0.00020408163265308178,0.00020408163265308178,0.00020408163265308178,0.01779710099472646,0.00020408163265308178,0.00020408163265308178,0.00020408163265308178,0.00020408163265308178,0.00020408163265308178,0.010720394241233538,0.00020408163265308178,0.00020408163265308178,0.00020408163265308178,0.00020408163265308178,0.023861653594625713,0.00020408163265308178,0.00020408163265308178,0.00020408163265308178,0.00020408163265308178,0.0662577687031972,0.00020408163265308178,0.1573679510992812,0.00020408163265308178,0.00020408163265308178,0.00020408163265308178,0.00020408163265308178,0.00020408163265308178,0.00020408163265308178,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

10176,0,"I wholeheartedly agree with Greg in Ontario . I saw this movie today with a friend who actually went to the theatre manager afterwards and told him "" That was possibly the worst movie I have ever seen . "" I have seen a LOT of movies with this person , and he 's pretty forgiving , so I was actually shocked . ( The manager gave him a free pass!)I was offended by much of the humor in the film ( yes , the baked potato scene was on the top of the list ! ) . My friend and I are white and saw the film with a primarily black audience . For awhile I thought , maybe I just do n't get this movie because I 'm white . Then I realized NO ONE was laughing . The writing was bad ; the direction was bad ; the timing was almost non - existent . There were a few funny moments , there was just WAY too much time between them . Even Airplane Two was funnier than this , and that 's saying a lot . I was so dazzled by Snoop Dogg in Starsky and Hutch ( as Huggy Bear ) that I felt I was sure to enjoy this movie . Nope . DL Hughley was funny , as usual , but his role was rather small . Tom Arnold had a few funny moments as "" the white guy "" , but most other attempts at humor fell far short of the mark .

10252,0,"Geesh , I never , ever , ever thought I 'd write the above four words . But , actually , she 's the highpoint of this little flick . As the movie was packaged when I rented it , it supposedly is a comedy about a girl who is kidnapped but does n't have her medication , which keeps her stable . It sounded like a cute concept . For years , all we ever saw of Spelling was as Donna Martin in 90210 and an endless parade of dull , lifeless TV movies . It sounded like a chance for her to stretch a little , and considering that with her TV success and her rich daddy , she could n't have any financial reason to do this movie , I figured she took the part because this must be a low - budget jewel . Wrong . Instead , Spelling 's part is small , and the bit about the mentally unbalanced kidnap victim is just one of several storylines . When she 's not on the screen , the movie crawls so badly , I could 've sworn it was longer than the 85 minutes that were listed on the tape . This would 've worked so much better if Spelling 's storyline had dominated , and it had been changed into a romantic comedy with her and Phil , the least irritating kidnapper .",239,0,0.17888457784140108,0.0005555555555555935,0.0005555555555555935,0.0005555555555555935,0.0005555555555555935,0.030812854169041073,0.0005555555555555935,0.0005555555555555935,0.02538064059088776,0.0005555555555555935,0.0005555555555555935,0.0005555555555555935,0.0005555555555555935,0.0005555555555555935,0.0005555555555555935,0.0005555555555555935,0.0005555555555555935,0.0005555555555555935,0.028331992568438408,0.0005555555555555935,0.34346474149279704,0.0005555555555555935,0.0005555555555555935,0.0579191331268389,0.04859077473568396,0.0005555555555555935,0.0005555555555555935,0.0005555555555555935,0.0005555555555555935,0.0005555555555555935,0.0005555555555555935,0.0005555555555555935,0.0677553168124741,0.0005555555555555935,0.0005555555555555935,0.0005555555555555935,0.0005555555555555935,0.0005555555555555935,0.0005555555555555935,0.0005555555555555935,0.10230287369034728,0.0005555555555555935,0.0005555555555555935,0.0005555555555555935,0.09433487274986649,0.0005555555555555935,0.0005555555555555935,0.0005555555555555935,0.0005555555555555935,0.0005555555555555935,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0
10496,0,"This is a movie that was probably made to entertain the middle school , early high school age kids . Maybe to them it 's funny , they may possibly even see something scary in it . To me , the acting is poor , and plot is poor , there 's just not much value at all for the adult viewer . I saw this film as weak and boring . At times there was the possibility that the movie could become interesting but it never really materialized . The creatures look pretty good but after seeing them for a few seconds , they do n't seem to have any substance other than the look . At times I was n't sure if the movie was trying to make another attempt at comedy or was it just another attempt at horror that failed again . This movie just was n't good for me .",155,0,0.00048780487804881193,0.00048780487804881193,0.07222915214200447,0.00048780487804881193,0.00048780487804881193,0.02557755917755268,0.00048780487804881193,0.00048780487804881193,0.00048780487804881193,0.00048780487804881193,0.00048780487804881193,0.00048780487804881193,0.00048780487804881193,0.00048780487804881193,0.00048780487804881193,0.00048780487804881193,0.00048780487804881193,0.00048780487804881193,0.00048780487804881193,0.00048780487804881193,0.5195178607763707,0.24926810462297172,0.00048780487804881193,0.00048780487804881193,0.00048780487804881193,0.05935879983268736,0.00048780487804881193,0.00048780487804881193,0.00048780487804881193,0.00048780487804881193,0.00048780487804881193,0.00048780487804881193,0.00048780487804881193,0.00048780487804881193,0.052585108814265084,0.00048780487804881193,0.00048780487804881193,0.00048780487804881193,0.00048780487804881193,0.00048780487804881193,0.00048780487804881193,0.00048780487804881193,0.00048780487804881193,0.00048780487804881193,0.00048780487804881193,0.00048780487804881193,0.00048780487804881193,0.00048780487804881193,0.00048780487804881193,0.00048780487804881193,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Jessica can find things with a stick and she finds the head of an evil guy . Of course they do n't know this until the owner of the farm 's helpers open the box containing the head .

The thing is with this movie , is that it has no head or tail , but merely a section in time about the life of the three main characters . When it started I already knew that it was gon na be a long sit down , but sometimes things can get better , in this case not . There is no real character development or interconnection between the players . You start in the middle of a situation , all of the sudden there 's a girlfriend and then there 's a guy with whom he needs to be friends with in order to fulfill his sports ambitions , but the way they are put together is quite odd , since they are "" just put together "" , so it seems . And all of the sudden they have sex with each other , at least one you can see of . The feeling of guilt or jealousy with the other guy is hardly noticeable and really all I could think of during the movie was "" when are they gon na have sex again ? "" . And when you think of it , it 's quite insane really . Because it basically means there is nothing really worth looking at , but three teens going at it and that , for me at least , makes it a very crappy movie , stay clear from it and save your money ( my 7,50 is wasted ) , there are better art - house movies than this one .

11526,0,"I really do n't think producer George Lucas did n't really set out to make such a horrible sequel as "" More American Graffiti "" turned out to be . But in retrospect it was the first crack in his then - seemingly impenetrable armor . Coming straight off the huge success of "" American Graffiti "" and produced basically at the same time as "" Star Wars "" , this film was the first that Lucas successfully took away from Coppola without having to bother directing it himself . The result is typical Lucas -- far more interesting in terms of its structure and the way it 's edited than the actual material . The writer / director Bill Norton has been allowed to use a variety of different screen ratios and split screens to produce odd associations in the images . While it 's interesting to see ironic juxtapositions of the 4 story lines , the style ultimately only epitomizes the fractured nature of the film itself . Lucas ' brilliant original film was all about a group of friends on the archetypical "" last big night "" before school ends and Kurt ( Ron Dreyfuss ) and Steve ( Ron Howard ) are supposed to go off to college . One thing that made that film work , despite the fact that it 's very episodic , is that you had the core characters together at the beginning and they come back together at the end . There 's a disposition of time , like in Nick Ray 's "" Rebel Without a Cause "" where a certain period of time becomes very elastic and takes on more meaning than such a specific time really would in actual life , but everything takes place in a static space . "" More American Graffiti "" is basically the opposite -- the space is very dynamic , with Toad ( Charles Martin Smith ) off in Vietnam , his former girlfriend Debbie ( Candy Clark ) partying with hippies in San Francisco , Steve and Laurie ( Cindy Williams ) involved in student protests in Berkeley , and John Miler ( Paul Le Mat ) drag racing on the semi - pro circuit . In a contrived meeting early in the film all the principles are brought together to watch John race , but after that the threads do n't come back together and weave apart the way they do in the original . Instead they split off and we follow the characters through about 3 years ' of time , just seeing various events on New Years Eve in what seems to be 1967 , 68 and 69 . It 's easy for the audience to become confused , and I think it 's fair to say that we do . While the original film seemed to condense important events and rites of passages into unreal theatrical time that produced an experience of nostalgia even for those who never experienced those events , this sequel drags and stretches the few plot points from the epilogue of the original and attempts to make them into a coherent film . The best parts of the movie to me are the ones with Candy Clark in SF and Charles Martin Smith in Nam . Some of the jokes do fall flat but the style of those sections is interesting and they form a neat contrast with each other . A good movie could maybe have been made if these parts were just a bit better , and if the other parts were n't such a drag . Speaking of drag racing , the whole plot with Milner talking to a foreign exchange student was really lame , unfunny , and throwing in Mackenzie Phillips for a cameo did n't help at all . It was just another contrived moment , like when they briefly explain why Curt is n't in the movie because he 's already in Canada . Instead Laurie just has another brother who is basically identical to Curt but has a different name and is now played by a very boring actor . There 's a black kind of satire to some of the Vietnam stuff , very similar to what I would imagine Lucas and John Milius ' original idea for "" Apocalypse Now "" would have been like . And there 's some of that manic fun in the San Francisco scenes that made the first movie fun . But still along with that fun stuff , you have the rest of the movie dragging it down , as if anyone wants to see Steve and Laurie argue in their horrible suburban abode as if they were auditioning for a Spielberg movie about divorce and child abandonment . I think even if those parts of the movie were n't so painful , it still would n't really be comparable to the first movie because there 's no closure and no sense of coming back together or of anybody having learned anything . It just sort of ends at the point when they ran out of money or something , a cheap freeze frame imitation of "" Two - Lane Blacktop "" and so many better films . Like the original however , this film has a great soundtrack of period hits that is probably worth owning for its own sake and almost makes the movie itself palatable . The performances by Country Joe and the Fish are great , and Scott Glenn all duded up as a hippie in love with Candy Clark is a sight to see -- I wonder if even back then he had to use a wig ? I could n't possibly recommend this movie , and yet it has some small affection in my heart because I love the original so much . Every couple of decades I guess I have to give this movie a try just to make sure that it 's really as worthless as I remember it being . It 's a party killer but it 's something that every fan of "" American Graffiti "" or George Lucas in general will want to see at least once or twice . It shows how a lot of effort can go into something and it can still turn out pretty half baked . It makes you reflect on how much of a miracle it is that Lucas actually made such a good movie as "" American Graffiti "" in the first place , as if all the elements were in place and all the appropriate gods had been placated . Unfortunately such was not the case for this film or for Bill Norton .",1126,0,0.00010204081632654107,0.00010204081632654107,0.00010204081632654107,0.00010204081632654107,0.02367099290083523,0.00010204081632654107,0.00010204081632654107,0.00010204081632654107,0.00010204081632654107,0.00010204081632654107,0.00010204081632654107,0.00010204081632654107,0.00010204081632654107,0.00010204081632654107,0.0054735682432959145,0.00010204081632654107,0.00010204081632654107,0.00010204081632654107,0.00010204081632654107,0.00010204081632654107,0.40025536483983565,0.17573210068041847,0.00010204081632654107,0.00010204081632654107,0.007598337684820248,0.018690806641169545,0.00010204081632654107,0.00010204081632654107,0.00010204081632654107,0.00010204081632654107,0.00010204081632654107,0.04522200422815516,0.023305815326734085,0.00010204081632654107,0.00010204081632654107,0.005847750782750846,0.00010204081632654107,0.00010204081632654107,0.02933874862011313,0.022517658889165335,0.029240020368892818,0.005541339570044869,0.00010204081632654107,0.19151675710876787,0.00010204081632654107,0.00010204081632654107,0.012477305543571895,0.00010204081632654107,0.00010204081632654107,0.00010204081632654107,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0
11530,0,"The trouble with this sort of lyrical film - making is that you either make a masterpiece , or a lemon : there 's little middle ground . Putting it gently , this is not "" Berlin - symphony of a city "" or "" Man with a Movie Camera "" . Unfortunately , it 's not much to look at , either . The problem with this one is that it 's glib and half - baked , as if Michael Moore had come on board . It does n't really have anything to say , or rather , to show us with pictures and sounds . Koyanisqatsi uses images cumulatively to propound a thesis . This is just a patchwork in search of a point . ( Though , quite inadvertently , the movie tells us more about the mind of Uncle Sam than it intends . There is something profoundly paradoxical about an anti - technology , anti - civilisation , anti - media movie that is so profoundly souped up with technology . ' Do as I say , and not as I do ' . You just got ta love the Yanks , eh . ) Tonally , there 's something sour and misanthropic about this episode . Both the prior episodes had moments of lyricism and exhilaration ; this time the tone is consistently glum . It simply does n't work over this duration , as Gustav Mahler will tell you . Stylistically , Naqoyqatsi is a mess . The whizzy digital stuff is particularly misguided . It gives the whole thing a totally fussy , overprocessed look , and it also undermines the ' realist ' nature of the analogue ' found footage ' . ( I mean , I pity the guys . Part of the joy of Koyanisqaatsi was that it was a homage to the use of optical film . But now optical film 's an historical artifact , they have to ' take on board ' the digital domain ; but I do n't think they bring it off . The digital stuff often looks like video links from CNN or BBC World . ) And with the "" found footage "" , well , the digital manipulation is often ugly , and usually just silly , and the false colour and solarisation kept me thinking of ...... ahem ... James Bond title sequences . Ahem . Odd as it may seem , there is also the possibility that the movie has been simply stolen by Yo Yo Ma 's performance ; it 's about as unobtrusive as a Lawrence Olivier voice - over . The images would have to be jolly compelling to stack up against all that charisma . Philip Glass himself is on odd form ; never expected him to knock off the Verdi requiem ! ( Made me laugh , which , of course , is not the desired response to any part of this movie ) . There 's even one piece of music that sounds like Brahms . ( ? ) Perhaps they 've changed his pills . From our ' idle questions ' department : is Geoffrey Reggio actually a Hopi Indian at all ? Or did he just do a sweatlodge in Hollywood Hills ? Oh , and are the various snippets bits of footage from earlier ' episodes ' in the trilogy a commentary on the way these movies , too , are part of the global media slushy ?",590,0,0.21041788363082883,0.0002631578947368671,0.0002631578947368671,0.0002631578947368671,0.0002631578947368671,0.0002631578947368671,0.0002631578947368671,0.0002631578947368671,0.0002631578947368671,0.0002631578947368671,0.0002631578947368671,0.0002631578947368671,0.06268426993389141,0.0002631578947368671,0.025471205233214674,0.0002631578947368671,0.0002631578947368671,0.0002631578947368671,0.0002631578947368671,0.0002631578947368671,0.35901500932247027,0.0002631578947368671,0.017066858237904266,0.0002631578947368671,0.0002631578947368671,0.0002631578947368671,0.0002631578947368671,0.0002631578947368671,0.0002631578947368671,0.0002631578947368671,0.0002631578947368671,0.0002631578947368671,0.0330584225661087,0.0002631578947368671,0.0002631578947368671,0.01492838938912155,0.0002631578947368671,0.0002631578947368671,0.0002631578947368671,0.0002631578947368671,0.0002631578947368671,0.0002631578947368671,0.0002631578947368671,0.13747080030687084,0.11222850760459709,0.017132337985517533,0.0002631578947368671,0.0002631578947368671,0.0002631578947368671,0.0002631578947368671,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0

11988,0,"As a flagship show , Attack of the Show ( AOTS ) is endemic of the larger fall of G4 TV ; it is a show ( and a station ) that has fallen so far that it parades sex to try and cover its glaring faults . Its predecessor , The Screen Savers , was a venue for troubleshooting technology problems and scouting out the latest and greatest in technology . It was a nice show with a likable staff and it was fun to see some of the modding and other experiments the crew could put to together . The acquisition of TechTV by G4 bothered some longtime fans of the station , but early returns were actually promising . The emphasis on gaming was a nice addition and I really enjoyed a lot of the coverage of E3 and other big entertainment events . Unfortunately , AOTS now stands as but a shell of its former self . Those overseeing the channel have shifted the focus of the channel away from technology and gaming and toward anything that might elicit drool from young adult men . The result is that AOTS spends as much time parading Olivia Munn or touting the adult film industry as it does covering games . It is so bad it is practically unwatchable . While some may get puerile joy out of this sort of thing , those who genuinely enjoy gaming may wonder where the good coverage went . Equally troubling , young gamers who might tune into G4 thinking their getting gaming - that active gaming group between 10 - 15 - are instead being fed things aimed toward a more mature audience . On a channel like HBO or Cinemax , things like that are expected . On G4 , it 's tragic . At least SpikeTV , another male - aimed channel , has good programming like CSI . AOTS , and G4 , has very little good left to offer .

12034,0,"Mount Godwin - Austin ( otherwise known as K2 ) is the world 's second highest mountain , and if the evidence presented in this film is to be believed is the hardest mountain to climb successfully without getting yourself killed . "" K2 "" is basically a buddy flick set in the breathtakingly dangerous world of mountaineering . While the outdoor photography takes in some truly awesome scenery , the characters standing in front of all those glorious landscapes are a crashing bore - and therein lies the fault with the whole film . Cocksure lawyer Taylor Brooks ( Michael Biehn ) and his quiet married friend Harold Jamieson ( Matt Craven ) spend their free time rock climbing . During one of their trips , they meet up with another bunch of climbers funded by wealthy mountain enthusiast Philip Claibourne ( Raymond J. Barry ) . Claibourne 's team are in training for a forthcoming shot at the infamous K2 , a mountain that Taylor and Harold would both love to tackle but could never afford to do so . During their training run , however , two of Claibourne 's team get themselves killed in an avalanche . Taylor and Harold put themselves forward as potential replacements . Despite initial reluctance , Claibourne gives them the nod of approval and the pair find themselves joining his team in the Himalayas . Harold 's wife Cindy ( Julia Nickson - Soul ) is distraught that her husband is going to take on such a dangerous climb , especially since he has recently become a father . Tensions in the climbing team mount as Taylor repeatedly clashes with another member of the group , the equally brash and arrogant Dallas Woolf ( Luca Bercovici ) . Meanwhile , Claibourne himself grows increasingly ill as altitude sickness takes its toll on his body . Will the guys reach the peak of K2 , or is their quest destined to end in disappointment , or even death?""K2 "" spends an inordinately long time introducing its somewhat dislikeable characters . Biehn as a foul - mouthed , pushy , adventurous type is especially hard to like , as is Barry as the hard - nosed mountaineering millionaire . But on the other side of the coin , Craven is so dull that it becomes difficult to believe his wife could possibly give a damn about him going off to climb K2 - heck , she 'd be better off if he never came back ! ! Rounding off the main characters is Bercovici , whose characterisation as Dallas Woolf is as campy and over - the - top as every other role he 's ever played . The story itself is totally tame and disposable  just a straightforward yarn about guys trying to reach the top of a mountain . There 's a bit of male bonding thrown in , but the whole subplot about Harold and his wife amounts to nil , and the personality clashes between Taylor and Dallas ring totally false . "" K2 "" scores its few merits solely from the stunning cinematography by Gabriel Berastain  during the Himalayan sequences , the scale and awe of the mountains is quite nicely captured . I 'm completely with critic Kim Newman on this one , who hilariously stated in Empire magazine : "" On this evidence , climbing K2 ca n't be any harder than sitting through it !

12196,0,"I feel very generous giving this movie a 2 out of 10 . Okay , noted that the special effects are , ' okay ' and Renny Harlin did make one my favorite genetically - altered - sharks - attack - a - research - station movie , that of which you may know as Deep Blue Sea . Also , the opening credits are done fairly well with a remix of WhiteZombie 's "" more human then human ' and it does go fairly well with what is in the context of this ' movie ' . But enough praise , lets get to the reason why this movie sucks so much . Not since Uwe Boll 's Alone in the Dark did i ever feel that the special effects in a movie were totally wasted . Okay , our story starts with four guys who are descendants of four different families , each of which possess a never fully explained power from a never fully explained family background that did a never fully explained art of witch craft . Oh and for some reason , these descendants are all 17 , all go to the same school , are all on the swim team and all , for some reason or another , sit in bed with their shirts off , sweating and talking to each other on the phone . I have nothing against gays , Gothic or thirteen year old 's , but that is what this movie is aimed at ... 13 year old goth who question their sexuality . Yeah there 's girls in it who sit on their beds in their panties or whatever , but how come they do n't take their shirts off ? hey its only fair . Anyways , the characters in this movie are told that when they turn 18 , they will ascend and be granted new profound , almost god - like powers . But before i go any further , i forgot to mention that when they use their powers , they age slowly and they grow more addicted to it . That explains why they got people in their late 20 's to play 17 year old 's . Oh and if something needs explaining , do n't worry , someone will explain it all in one large piece of dialog . God this movie sucks ... where was I ? oh yeah , the ascension part . Okay , apparently there was a super - secret - alpha - one family that the others forgot about or some s#*t like that , i do n't know , i was dozing off at this point . But they were written out some how and the new kid at school who is befriending the group is ' secretly ' one of these descendants from the fifth family . And I say ' secretly ' because anyone who has seen any of the previews of this movie knows that this new guy is the bad guy . He has greater power then the others because he 's older i think . Anyways , Bob Loblaw ( say it out loud ) things happen and we get to the final fight in the movie . To be honest , I was all game for a witch battle . You know like Saurmon vs. Gandalf or anything along the lines with magic battle , because you know , this is about witches and stuff . Now , when these two witches throw down , its more of like ... how can i put it ... a very , very crappy version of a Dragonball Z type battle . They throw stuff at each other , talk , throw stuff , talk , throw stuff , talk etc . When i say ' throw stuff ' i only say that because i have no clue what the F#%k their throwing at each other . It looks like big gobs of slimy water . God this movie sucks , anyways , when our main witch ' ascends ' he does n't get very powerful at all . He just throws bigger gobs of slimy water . Things happen and it ends in a way that you as the viewer know its gon na end . The good witch wins bad witch loses . You know how shitty a movie is when the bad guy says something so incredibly stupid as , ' I 'm gon na make you my Wiotch ' That s where i wanted to punch myself in the face for sitting through this whole ... thing . Yes , i admit , the thought of witches doing battle , using powers in the modern day does sound kinda cool , but when the execution is this bad , i really wished they did n't make THIS movie . Maybe if it was R - rated , had tit 's and threw in more deaths with a dash of gore , it might have worked ... might have worked . If your interested in watching this , do n't buy it or even rent it . Wait for it to come on TV or borrow it from your sucker of a friend who bought it . Just do n't waste your time with this hack of a movie . If you spend any money on it , there 's a good chance your putting an effort towards a sequel to be made by Uwe Boll called , The Covenant 2 : Alone in the dark with the house of the dead .",944,0,0.0001257861635220246,0.01581071711875065,0.0001257861635220246,0.0001257861635220246,0.0001257861635220246,0.0001257861635220246,0.03206749075213139,0.05454057647661282,0.02192326383590019,0.0001257861635220246,0.0001257861635220246,0.0001257861635220246,0.12461713191335962,0.0001257861635220246,0.003954586178033488,0.0001257861635220246,0.053129710135904354,0.013471693663875866,0.006415094339621401,0.00920576014972071,0.4480710659371496,0.0001257861635220246,0.0001257861635220246,0.04040543856627415,0.0001257861635220246,0.0001257861635220246,0.010653955400700778,0.0001257861635220246,0.006558625396297699,0.0001257861635220246,0.0001257861635220246,0.0001257861635220246,0.0001257861635220246,0.0001257861635220246,0.0001257861635220246,0.0001257861635220246,0.0001257861635220246,0.0001257861635220246,0.0001257861635220246,0.01180532145246423,0.0001257861635220246,0.013536555716625905,0.015272793247585953,0.0001257861635220246,0.04710663861061243,0.04317226007955398,0.024507736123164144,0.0001257861635220246,0.0001257861635220246,0.0001257861635220246,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0
12407,0,"I was sitting at home and flipping channels when I ran across what potentially sounded like an interesting film . I like Destruction type movies and decided to watch it . I do n't know why but I ended up watching it the whole 2 hours . We have seen this type of movie I do n't know how many times . Back in 1998 - 2000 there were dozen of films that dealt with global destruction of some sort . The best one on my list so far is Deep Impact which was more believable than this one . Here are my problems with this film : 1 ) cheap special effects , like something out of the old computer . 2 ) no background information or explanation on weather patterns . If you are going to make a movie about weather , at least have some decency to entertain the viewer with technical details . 3 ) How come only 2 or 3 people figure out that the storm is converging on Chicago ... no more experts left in the field ? 4 ) where are some interesting characters ? I truly do n't care for anyone except maybe the pregnant woman . I felt that there was no character development . 5 ) no thought provoking moment what so ever and factually incorrect theme . And this is only the first part of the film . I bet the conclusion will show us few destruction scenes and a search and rescue operation just like it has been done many times before . And judging by the special effects in the first part of the movie , I can only imagine what we are to expect . Of course , at the end , the main characters will survive and life will go on ... how original",309,0,0.00032786885245904355,0.00032786885245904355,0.00032786885245904355,0.03002918859750965,0.00032786885245904355,0.00032786885245904355,0.08690725933282631,0.00032786885245904355,0.00032786885245904355,0.00032786885245904355,0.00032786885245904355,0.00032786885245904355,0.00032786885245904355,0.00032786885245904355,0.00032786885245904355,0.00032786885245904355,0.00032786885245904355,0.00032786885245904355,0.00032786885245904355,0.00032786885245904355,0.3761716149608537,0.00032786885245904355,0.00032786885245904355,0.00032786885245904355,0.00032786885245904355,0.00032786885245904355,0.00032786885245904355,0.00032786885245904355,0.00032786885245904355,0.00032786885245904355,0.00032786885245904355,0.00032786885245904355,0.029203118206539636,0.00032786885245904355,0.03564302757251562,0.00032786885245904355,0.032405887646785404,0.00032786885245904355,0.00032786885245904355,0.00032786885245904355,0.00032786885245904355,0.00032786885245904355,0.00032786885245904355,0.2551664904022962,0.1407029214773936,0.00032786885245904355,0.00032786885245904355,0.00032786885245904355,0.00032786885245904355,0.00032786885245904355,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0
12422,0,"This film tried , but ultimately it was a waste of talent . It tried to hard to be "" sexy . "" I 'm not putting down the works of such actresses as Ellen Barkin and Peta Wilson ( who will find something besides TV 's "" Le Femme Nikita "" worthy of her talents . ) I just did n't find , even in Ms. Wilson 's so - called near - seduction scene with Mrs. Barkin any real emotion , even though I know the thespians tried very hard to make the scene work . If the sexual elements of Wilson 's disturbed sex victim did n't touch our heart ( which it did n't even by an ending it did n't deserve ) , neither did the murder element of the plot . Perhaps it was the script or perhaps the direction , but I did n't feel for anyone in this movie , and without this feeling , a movie does n't work for me . If you are interested in a movie about lesbianism , there are a least two films on either side of the specturum to check out : 1 . ) The gulity pleasure of "" Bound "" which works well in a noir setting ; and 2 . ) The more honest , and touching story of a lesbian growing up in Hell 's Kitchen called "" All Over Me . "" It 's a well - defined indie from the mid-90 's that handles that coming - of - age issue with feeling , not forced sexuality .

12457,0,"George Zucco was like Boris Karloff in the fact no matter how poor the film he appeared in was , he would always maintain a sense of dignity and turn in a fine performance . "" The Mad Monster "" is no exception to that rule . It is by all standards a poor ( if entertaining ) film . The filmmakers obviously did n't know how to make the most of their low budget and the script seems as if it was turned out in one or two days . Still , Zucco is fine and believable as the mad scientist . The film itself is enjoyable on a camp level . Normal horror movie fans for the most part wo n't take a liking to PRC films . However , these "" Poverty Row "" productions have a small but loyal cult following . Occasionally they would rise above their limitations with "" Detour "" being the best example of this . Usually they looked like this . For all its technically poor qualities , "" The Mad Monster "" is an amusing enough way to kill a rainy afternoon .

12663,0,"' Flight Of Fury ' is a shockingly dire but worst of all boring Action Film - I do n't expect a lot from a Seagal Film , all I expect is to be moderately entertained for 90 or so minutes with some mindless action -unfortunately this does n't even achieve that low expectation , The action scenes are few and far between , the plot ( which is totally irrelevant in these Films ) is needlessly complicated and confusing with huge plot holes throughout , The acting is truly abysmal - bordering on embarrassing with Seagal and his whispering One expression performance being the best among the sorry lot of 3rd raters - I find it hard to believe that anything close to $ 12 M was spent on this dire mess unless $ 11 M of that 12 was Seagal 's Salary - I somehow doubt it ! The one moment of any interest to Straight guys or gay girls is that out of seemingly nowhere two hot chicks end up in a lesbian sex scene of sorts complete with huge baps on display other than that - It 's mediocre stuff which is no different to many of the Michael Dudikoff B - Movies I 've endured1/10",210,0,0.0004651162790698153,0.0004651162790698153,0.0004651162790698153,0.042947759929831575,0.0004651162790698153,0.0004651162790698153,0.0004651162790698153,0.0004651162790698153,0.0004651162790698153,0.0004651162790698153,0.07999972541073536,0.0004651162790698153,0.0004651162790698153,0.0004651162790698153,0.0004651162790698153,0.0004651162790698153,0.0004651162790698153,0.0004651162790698153,0.02371410000047947,0.0004651162790698153,0.0004651162790698153,0.40816695978301326,0.0004651162790698153,0.0004651162790698153,0.0004651162790698153,0.0004651162790698153,0.0004651162790698153,0.0004651162790698153,0.0004651162790698153,0.0004651162790698153,0.0004651162790698153,0.0004651162790698153,0.05850202078683523,0.0004651162790698153,0.0004651162790698153,0.0004651162790698153,0.0004651162790698153,0.0004651162790698153,0.0004651162790698153,0.0004651162790698153,0.0004651162790698153,0.0004651162790698153,0.025655057971166437,0.2519800976301287,0.08949939476687784,0.0004651162790698153,0.0004651162790698153,0.0004651162790698153,0.0004651162790698153,0.0004651162790698153,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0

13216,0,"Well , here we have yet another role reversal movie . There were many worth watching , despite the tired plot of gender reversal . However , this one is not . In previous reviews , I think I 've made my point about the general decline of enjoyment for Haim movies that followed the late 80s . This is one of them . 'Just One of the Girls ' is about a high school kid ( Corey Haim ) who tries to avoid his bullies by dressing up as a girl and attending another school . He joins the cheerleading squad and makes friends with fellow cheerleader , Marie ( Nicole Eggert ) . Obviously , he ca n't keep up the charade for too much longer . I thought this movie was utter crap , and it was n't even funny . But , judging by a majority of reviews , it looks like fans of Alanis Morrisette or teen sex queen , Nicole Eggert , are the only ones who 'd want to watch this . If you 're looking for a good Haim feature ( or role switching comedy ) , look no further than 1989 . This is about the point that Haim 's career tanked .",212,0,0.0005000000000000423,0.0005000000000000423,0.0005000000000000423,0.0005000000000000423,0.0005000000000000423,0.0005000000000000423,0.0005000000000000423,0.0005000000000000423,0.0005000000000000423,0.0005000000000000423,0.0005000000000000423,0.0005000000000000423,0.0005000000000000423,0.0005000000000000423,0.0005000000000000423,0.0005000000000000423,0.0005000000000000423,0.0005000000000000423,0.0005000000000000423,0.0005000000000000423,0.5574331137399132,0.0005000000000000423,0.0005000000000000423,0.04341098436682951,0.12739994853885336,0.08785633246310956,0.0005000000000000423,0.0005000000000000423,0.0005000000000000423,0.16139962089129226,0.0005000000000000423,0.0005000000000000423,0.0005000000000000423,0.0005000000000000423,0.0005000000000000423,0.0005000000000000423,0.0005000000000000423,0.0005000000000000423,0.0005000000000000423,0.0005000000000000423,0.0005000000000000423,0.0005000000000000423,0.0005000000000000423,0.0005000000000000423,0.0005000000000000423,0.0005000000000000423,0.0005000000000000423,0.0005000000000000423,0.0005000000000000423,0.0005000000000000423,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

13972,0,"I tuned into this thing one night on a cable channel a few minutes after the credits ran , so I did n't know who had done it at first . The longer I saw it , the more I started thinking , "" Jesus , this looks like an Albert Pyun flick . "" Was n't quite sure , though , for two main reasons : the photography was quite good ( and the Utah desert scenery was beautiful ) , and Scott Paulin gave an hilarious performance as Simon , a murderous cyborg , but with some style and a sense of humor . Paulin must have ad - libbed the many clever one - liners he shot out , because Albert Pyun has n't written anything even remotely funny or coherent in his career . Unfortunately , Paulin does n't have all that much screen time before he 's gone , and the movie 's the worse for it . Lance Henriksen , playing the evil head cyborg , growls his way through his part , as he 's done in countless other movies like this . I do n't know what the hell Kris Kristofferson is doing in this thing ; maybe he wanted to see what the Utah desert looked like and get paid for it . He goes through the movie looking ( and sounding ) like he just woke up , and in fact spends most of the last half of the movie on his back in a tent . Kathy Long , the nominal hero , has a great body , is attractive , has a great body , fights extremely well , has a great body , and does n't have an iota of acting talent , but that does n't matter in a movie like this . This being an Albert Pyun film , it 's full of the trademarks that we 've all come to know and love : inane and idiotic dialog , choppy editing , and the impression that they lost a reel in the middle of the picture and figured , "" Ah , nobody'll ever notice . ""As bad as this movie is , however , it 's a shade above most of Pyun 's other efforts -- this is "" Citizen Kane "" compared to his brain - numbing "" Adrenaline : Feel the Rush "" , for example .

14372,0,"This is a dumb movie . Maybe my judgment would n't be so harsh if the film did n't promise so much , but I just felt like this movie cheated and played me for a fool at every turn . I did n't have any beef with the acting , but I thought the characters were awful . The movie starts off with Clive Owen 's character telling us what a criminal mastermind he is , and how he planned the perfect bank robbery , something he frequently reminds us of later . Oh yeah , he also tells us he 's in a prison cell , although that turns out to be a dumb metaphor . Any idiot knows that the best bank robbery is one where a minimum number of things could potentially go wrong , and you 're long gone before the police show up . But Clive Owen 's scheme requires hanging around the bank for hours - for no reason but to stalk around and look scary as far as I can tell . He also has to control hostages , negotiate with cops , and most fantastically of all , perform a This - Old - House job on the bank 's stockroom and hide out there for a week ( I hope he brought enough food , and a bucket to pee in ) and then sneak out again . Yeah , that sure sounds like the perfect crime to me , Clive ! This plan has so many moving parts that the only reason it did n't fall apart was the screenwriter said so . And then there are the many unexplained details : Why were the cops so convinced that the crooks had accomplices among the hostages ? Who the hell is Jodie Foster 's character , and why is she so important that she has the mayor at her beck and call and she does n't have to tell Denzel Washington her agenda because "" it 's above his pay scale ? "" How dumb are these cops that they ca n't figure out one guy speaking in a foreign language for hours is not the sound of a criminal gang planning a robbery ? How did the robbers slip away , and why did Clive Owen stick around for a week ? How did they find out about the bank chairman 's past , and the number and contents of his safe deposit box ? Why the hell would Clive Owen let in Jodie Foster or the cops ? Since when do they make toy AK-47s that look real up close ? How the hell do you bug a pizza box , anyway ? How did Clive Owen manage to sneak out of a secure area of the bank during working hours , undetected ? Did this dispassionate criminal really feel bonded enough to this cop Denzel to slip him a diamond?None of these questions are ever answered . There are films that achieve depth by leaving you to wonder about events that happen off - screen , but I never felt that way about Inside Man . It felt like the scenes that explained these things were cut from the movie , or these questions never had any answers in the first place , and that 's weak . Particularly annoying is Jodie Foster 's character , who wo n't disclose what she does , but never seems to tire of reminding us how important she is . We 're just supposed to take her word for it , I guess . The only reason I gave this movie two stars is I laughed at Denzel 's "" taxi cab "" and "" pina colada "" gags , and at the kid 's outrageous video game . Other than that , this movie has no redeeming features .",651,0,0.06713770599838813,0.00018691588785048674,0.00018691588785048674,0.09273492665850563,0.00018691588785048674,0.00018691588785048674,0.00018691588785048674,0.00018691588785048674,0.014196967537193012,0.00018691588785048674,0.00018691588785048674,0.00018691588785048674,0.12068349219759188,0.00018691588785048674,0.00018691588785048674,0.00018691588785048674,0.056903048518749985,0.00018691588785048674,0.00018691588785048674,0.014706637260338442,0.3065660065202827,0.00018691588785048674,0.00018691588785048674,0.00018691588785048674,0.00018691588785048674,0.00018691588785048674,0.07125582834385985,0.00018691588785048674,0.013794001002268245,0.00018691588785048674,0.00018691588785048674,0.00018691588785048674,0.00018691588785048674,0.00018691588785048674,0.00018691588785048674,0.00018691588785048674,0.00018691588785048674,0.009555025314816917,0.00018691588785048674,0.00018691588785048674,0.00018691588785048674,0.00018691588785048674,0.00018691588785048674,0.06014168065899862,0.021894487077953235,0.1316603943661283,0.012040826582307781,0.00018691588785048674,0.00018691588785048674,0.00018691588785048674,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0

15014,0,"Fans of creature feature films have to endure a lot of awful movies lately . Blood Surf shamelessly joins the list of stupid , redundant pulp - horror titles about ridiculously big animals that want to turn the food chain upside down . Crocodiles are particularly successful as we already had to struggle our way through the abysmal ' Crocodile ' ( directed by a disappointing Tobe Hooper ) and ' Lake Placid ' . Blood Surf is every bit as bad as these other films and  on top of that  it likes to exaggerate tremendously . The saltwater - crocodile supposedly is 90 years old , over 30 ft long ( ! ) and it kills for fun ! During the film , he amuses himself by devouring a bunch of utterly stupid surfer - dudes & dudettes who came to seek new thrills by surfing in a shark - congested area . The only beautiful aspect about this film is the tropical location . Even though it 's a completely inappropriate setting for a film like this , the lagoons and nature looks marvelous . Every other aspect is simply disastrous . There 's a quite a bit of gore but it all looks fake and laughable . The dialogues are downright painful to listen to ! You wo n't believe some of the lines these actors have to say ! I know surfers are supposed to be a mentally underdeveloped group but I hope for their own sake they 're not that stupid ! Early in the film , one of the characters refers to Jaws as being a ' mechanical toy ' but the croc here looks at least 10 times less real than Spielberg 's great white shark . The visual effects in ' Blood Surf ' are amateurish and the massacres fail to impress . I wo n't say too much about the acting since it 's secondary in flicks like this . The girls look sexy in wet shirts and their boobs joyfully bounce while running away from the beast . You guessed right : Blood Surf is a very bad film . So bad it becomes fun again . But ' funny ' for a whole other reason than James Hickox intended .",383,0,0.0933878203377935,0.0002857142857143105,0.0002857142857143105,0.0002857142857143105,0.0002857142857143105,0.0002857142857143105,0.01487831995932579,0.0002857142857143105,0.0002857142857143105,0.0002857142857143105,0.0002857142857143105,0.0002857142857143105,0.0002857142857143105,0.0002857142857143105,0.01457142852256676,0.0002857142857143105,0.0002857142857143105,0.0002857142857143105,0.014545827359492584,0.0002857142857143105,0.4167434126032429,0.0002857142857143105,0.0002857142857143105,0.0002857142857143105,0.0002857142857143105,0.0002857142857143105,0.0002857142857143105,0.0002857142857143105,0.0002857142857143105,0.05399354880954988,0.0002857142857143105,0.0002857142857143105,0.06782447855036841,0.0002857142857143105,0.0002857142857143105,0.021148731093874388,0.0002857142857143105,0.0002857142857143105,0.0002857142857143105,0.0002857142857143105,0.025993858197618406,0.0002857142857143105,0.0002857142857143105,0.2654840031375951,0.0002857142857143105,0.0002857142857143105,0.0002857142857143105,0.0002857142857143105,0.0002857142857143105,0.0002857142857143105,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
15037,0,"College student Alex Gardner ( Nicholas Celozzi ) is plagued by nightmares of a cellar - dwelling ghoul at Alcatraz . He dreams of cutting off his own hand , spitting up a worm , a ghoul ripping open his chest and being roasted over an open fire . After his friends see him levitating "" 6 feet "" over his bed , a helpful , occult - obsessed teacher ( Donna Denton ) suggests that they sneak into Alcatraz to face his fears . Of course they go in the middle of the night when no one is around to help when things get out of hand!The group become stranded , Alex 's brother Richard ( Tom Reilly ) becomes possessed and starts killing everyone . Toni Basil of "" Mickey "" fame shows up as the helpful ghost of Sammy Mitchell , lead singer of the group "" Bodybag "" . She teaches Alex how to levitate out of his body and does a rock music dance intercut with repeat nightmare footage to pad out the running time . All of the victims show up as wisecracking ghosts a la the Griffin Dunne character in AN AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN LONDON . The script is full of plot holes , cheesy dialogue and lame attempts at comedy . Good FX work and cool opening credits ( both by Ernest D. Farino ) are the only things gaining any merit . Basil and Devo ( "" Whip It "" ) do some songs on the soundtrack .

Well that 's the only reason I can think of why this even exists . If you look past the horrible desecration of our beloved Looney Toons , then it looks like an OK show . But then there is already the teen titan 's , which is the same bloody thing . All the characters are dressed like batman , they drive around in some sort of ship fighting super villains , they have superpowers , only difference is they sort of talk like the Looney tunes and have similar names and character traits . This kind of thing falls into the "" it 's so ridiculous it 's good "" kind of category . Think of the Super Mario brother 's movie , and Batman and Robin . If you want to laugh for all the wrong reasons , check this out . If you are of the younger generation ( what this thing is actually intended for ) , and can look pass the greedy executives shamelessness , then run with it and enjoy . If you enjoy this cartoon I do n't have a problem with you , it 's the people who calculated this thing together that I am mad at . You know how they say piracy is like stealing a car ; this show is like grave robbing . They might as well of dug up all the people involved with the original cartoon , shoved them on a display , dressed them up in err pirate costumes , and charged money . If this show was n't using characters ( ones that did n't resemble the Looney Toons in anyway whatsoever ) that have already made the studios millions , then this would be fine . But no ! For shame Warner brothers , for shame . If I saw this thing as a 30 second gag on an episode of the Simpson 's or Family Guy , I would love it . As it is I just ca n't believe this was ever made . I would bet anyone that 80 % of the people who work on this show hate it . But whatever it does n't really matter , in 10 years this show will have been forgotten , while the originals will live on forever or at least until the world ends .

15152,0,"Lipstick is another glossy movie failure . I am trying to think of one good thing that I could say about the movie , and I am having trouble coming up with something . I guess the red dress that Margaux Hemingway was wearing in the end of the movie was the best part . The writing and the script was not the worst that I have ever encountered , but it could have been a lot better . Lipstick was very pleasing to the eye to view . The sets were very glossy and nice to look at . The cast was okay . I felt like Anne Bancroft 's character was the only feasible character in the entire movie . It was sad to see Chris Sarandon waste his time on this one .",136,0,0.0006451612903226599,0.0006451612903226599,0.0006451612903226599,0.0006451612903226599,0.0006451612903226599,0.0006451612903226599,0.0006451612903226599,0.0006451612903226599,0.0006451612903226599,0.0006451612903226599,0.0006451612903226599,0.0006451612903226599,0.0006451612903226599,0.0006451612903226599,0.0006451612903226599,0.0006451612903226599,0.0006451612903226599,0.0006451612903226599,0.0006451612903226599,0.0006451612903226599,0.9683870967741898,0.0006451612903226599,0.0006451612903226599,0.0006451612903226599,0.0006451612903226599,0.0006451612903226599,0.0006451612903226599,0.0006451612903226599,0.0006451612903226599,0.0006451612903226599,0.0006451612903226599,0.0006451612903226599,0.0006451612903226599,0.0006451612903226599,0.0006451612903226599,0.0006451612903226599,0.0006451612903226599,0.0006451612903226599,0.0006451612903226599,0.0006451612903226599,0.0006451612903226599,0.0006451612903226599,0.0006451612903226599,0.0006451612903226599,0.0006451612903226599,0.0006451612903226599,0.0006451612903226599,0.0006451612903226599,0.0006451612903226599,0.0006451612903226599,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
15208,0,"' Home Alone 3 ' is the first of the Home Alone movies not to feature Culkin in the main role and the same villains . However , the plot is very similar to the original ' Home Alone ' film . Instead of two comical villains , we get three or four of them . This film involves some traps , but it also has a long scene with a remote - control car . The slapstick humour is consistent as well , but the young boy and the villains really fail to make an impact in this film . ( No pun intended . ) This film offers nothing new or different than the previous films did , and there really is not the warm , holiday feeling or subplots that the other two films had . It 's more of a pure comedy , but it did not succeed in making me laugh as the characters really did not do it for me . I would not recommend this film ; it 's pretty boring . If you are seeking a good holiday family film with comedy , then watch the original ' Home Alone ' movie .",201,0,0.00040816326530615255,0.00040816326530615255,0.00040816326530615255,0.00040816326530615255,0.00040816326530615255,0.00040816326530615255,0.00040816326530615255,0.00040816326530615255,0.00040816326530615255,0.00040816326530615255,0.00040816326530615255,0.00040816326530615255,0.00040816326530615255,0.00040816326530615255,0.00040816326530615255,0.00040816326530615255,0.00040816326530615255,0.00040816326530615255,0.00040816326530615255,0.03880319986694985,0.16878609895289265,0.1947639110915393,0.00040816326530615255,0.00040816326530615255,0.040848427322107236,0.00040816326530615255,0.00040816326530615255,0.00040816326530615255,0.021456846608660516,0.00040816326530615255,0.00040816326530615255,0.00040816326530615255,0.00040816326530615255,0.00040816326530615255,0.1513738476150444,0.00040816326530615255,0.00040816326530615255,0.00040816326530615255,0.055764005347213076,0.00040816326530615255,0.00040816326530615255,0.00040816326530615255,0.00040816326530615255,0.31106080605273445,0.00040816326530615255,0.00040816326530615255,0.00040816326530615255,0.00040816326530615255,0.00040816326530615255,0.00040816326530615255,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
15790,0,"Every once in a while , a group of friends , with a minimal budget but bags of enthusiasm and talent , will create a low budget masterpiece that takes the world of horror by storm . Raimi and co. did it with The Evil Dead , Jackson and pals succeeded with Bad Taste ; and Myrick and Sanchez made a mint with The Blair Witch Project . Director Todd Sheets and his chums , however , are destined to wallow forever in relative obscurity if Zombie Bloodbath is anything to go by . A lesson in how not to make a cheapo horror , this miserable effort ( about a plague of flesh - eating zombiesnatch ) serves as a reminder that , whilst many people these days have access to a video camera , most should n't take that as their cue to try their hand at making a full - length movie . It 's not that Sheets has n't got an eye for a nicely framed shot ( some of his camera angles and movements are actually pretty good ) , but rather that a ) he has a lousy script b ) he has a lousy cast , and c ) he does n't realise that he has a lousy script and cast . Which means that the final film is amateurish in the extreme , and unlikely to be watched in its entirety by anyone other than zombie film completists ( like me ) or members of the cast and crew ( like those who have given the film favourable comments).Zombie Bloodbath is obviously aimed at undiscriminating gore - hounds , and Sheets ( who currently has an incredible 34 titles under his belt as a director ) certainly goes out of his way to please , with buckets of offal and blood thrown about at every opportunity . But whilst these moments are undeniably yucky , they are n't particularly convincing , and soon get rather tedious . So , to summarise , this is a really bad film , with almost no redeeming features . Except for two : Firstly , it features the single greatest mullet in the history of film , as sported by Jerry Angell , who plays Larry ( as well as several zombies ) . The magnificence of his barnet ( coupled with a fetching moustache ) is reason alone to watch this film . Secondly , it has ' pathetic stealth zombies ' : flesh - eating corpses that lie in wait for unfortunate victims to wander by , before leaping from their hiding place to launch a feeble attack , which requires almost no effort to escape from . Best known for lurking behind a door for hours waiting for someone to open it , ' pathetic stealth zombies ' also occasionally hide behind low walls , or sit in churches posing as members of the congregation . Normally a film this bad would get 1/10 for me , but , in celebration of Jerry Angell 's flowing locks , I will generously raise my rating to 2/10 .",524,0,0.00028169014084510085,0.00028169014084510085,0.00028169014084510085,0.0672398360909232,0.00028169014084510085,0.00028169014084510085,0.00028169014084510085,0.00028169014084510085,0.00028169014084510085,0.00028169014084510085,0.00028169014084510085,0.00028169014084510085,0.00028169014084510085,0.00028169014084510085,0.00028169014084510085,0.00028169014084510085,0.10281967307327401,0.00028169014084510085,0.00028169014084510085,0.00028169014084510085,0.19029569798096457,0.00028169014084510085,0.00028169014084510085,0.00028169014084510085,0.00028169014084510085,0.00028169014084510085,0.054555493873981474,0.00028169014084510085,0.00028169014084510085,0.00028169014084510085,0.00028169014084510085,0.015129568633611413,0.10177091510807408,0.00028169014084510085,0.00028169014084510085,0.00028169014084510085,0.00028169014084510085,0.00028169014084510085,0.00028169014084510085,0.00028169014084510085,0.00028169014084510085,0.00028169014084510085,0.00028169014084510085,0.42831917805650765,0.00028169014084510085,0.028038651267169677,0.00028169014084510085,0.00028169014084510085,0.00028169014084510085,0.00028169014084510085,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0
15796,0,"Even though this was a made - for - TV production , there 's absolutely no excuse for the rock bottom results of the finished product . This movie DID have a budget and it had a casting department , so , if you 're going to make a movie about a true life story , and actually put "" the true story "" in the title , should n't some effort be put forward to try and capture some realism ? First of all , this movie is absurdly cast . These actors belong in daytime television soaps , or in those ridiculous Lifetime channel movies , and not in a real - life gangster / criminal tale . Everything about them , from their looks to their mannerisms , just screams of the 90's - shopping - mall - alt - rock - listening generation . What about the script ? Two words describes it - stupid and insulting , and again it 's way too 90ish sounding . I do n't think the real Clyde Barrow ever uttered the words "" I 'm outta here . "" It 's as if a bunch of "" New Kids on the Block "" fans got together and decided to make a really "" kewl flick "" about Bonnie and Clyde , you know , one that would be totally rad and rockin ' . Well , this sticker does n't even rank on the rad and rockin ' scale . Everything that can be wrong with any kind of film is wrong here , from the casting and acting to the editing and music . Every single thing is grossly wrong .... and it 's infuriating that the parties responsible for this atrocious turkey had the nerve to put "" the true story "" in the title . It 's certainly NOT the true story , but even worse , it 's not even remotely entertaining as a mindless popcorn flick that 's accepted on its own terms . Like I stated in my heading , it 's simply horrible beyond words , on every level imaginable .

16586,0,"Do n't get me wrong , I love action and revenge flicks , I 've seen many of them since I was a kid , including Dolph Lundgren 's latest "" The Mechanik "" which is quite good . And Tony Scott certainly know how to use a camera and even might be a genius shooting and editing films . But with "" Man on Fire "" ( and even more then with "" Domino "" ) , Scott shows that rather than using his film - making "" genius "" skills intelligently , he uses it puposelessly to show off and compensate a lack of substance that his material does n't offer him . "" Man of Fire "" is close to 2 hours and half when it really should have been at least an hour less . The way Scott shot and edited this film also makes you wonder if he really wants you ( the audience ) to sit through his film because his constant camera moves and flashes really are a torture for the eye and makes you wanna leave the theater or turn it off after 5 minutes into it . At times where the MPAA and studios have questionable attitudes regarding ratings , violence and making PG-13 movies , I find also suspicious that a $ 70 million movie is made of a B - movie script with a character who cuts fingers , puts a bomb in a man 's ass and blows a guy 's hand with a shotgun , all this to avenge the death of a little girl who ISN'T even dead ! Go figure then why a studio will pass a better script because of the language or violence ...

17048,0,"Oh yes , Sakura Killers is a goofy , horrible ninja movie , make no mistake . But it 's also an incredibly enjoyable one . This is largely thanks to the awesome presence of one Chuck Connors , who is billed as starring in the movie but really only shines in a few scenes . I suppose he 's supposed to be sort of an Obi Wan Kenobi type ( "" The tough ninja - buster "" , the box copy exclaims ) but his ' wisdom ' is laughable . "" Move without thinking "" ? ? ? My friend says this is the sign of mental retardation , not of supreme concentration . But really , his two aides , Sonny and Dennis , have such horrible dialogue that ' Brooklyn ' , as we call The Colonel , tends to shine in comparison . Especially watch for Dennis ' logic regarding the ' genetic splicing ' the Sakura are involved with . If you know anything about cloning you will die laughing . And yes , this is a major plot point , folks . A terribly fun movie , Sakura Killers is a hard - to - find gem . I wo n't spoil the ' trick ' ending for you either , except that it 's a perfect set up for a Sakura Killers 2 .

17126,0,"it is of course very nice to see improvements on Turkish movie industry , however , i would have expected something more creative from Togan Gokbakar . starting from the script , which i believe it was not a wise written one as some may think . especially the cheesiness of the dialogs , which were putting the audience in a position that , as if they were not smart enough to understand the situations , which , most of the times makes the movie unbearable . it also has an obvious ending ; you can easily guess the murderer from the beginning . the weakest part of the scenario is that the impossibility of seriously mentally ill patients to act like normal people , like professionals right away!!!did they ever search for the possibility of patients who are on heavy medicals , to act like professionals and use all the medical terms that even normal people can not use?????!!!!!!also in the scene where staff was searching for the most dangerous patient , with out any weapon to protect themselves was another weird point of the film . and that scene was so suitable for "" Dikkat Sahan Cikabilir "" title ! ! those are not the only weak parts of the movie . there were also a lot of preciosities in the film . the depiction of the most dangerous patient was an exact copy from Hannibal , also appearance of Togan in the very end is obviously the worst mistake that he could have done in his first movie ! the fuss about the greatness of the movie and the interviews that actor 's gave just made people to be curious and force them to see it . Gen is a total disappointment . i would have wonder , if Sahan was not this famous , would Togan be able to shoot this movie , with this much of budget amount ? ? i hope Togan would realize that it is not fashionable to play in a role as a director as he said in an interview . it was Hitchcock who did it wisely and Night Shyamalan continued it successfully ! he should be aware of the fact that he is not Hitchcock nor Shyamalan yet!!!!hoping him to be more careful and creative next time in this big industry !",393,0,0.0003333333333333656,0.084641147921862,0.0003333333333333656,0.0003333333333333656,0.0003333333333333656,0.0003333333333333656,0.0003333333333333656,0.0003333333333333656,0.0003333333333333656,0.0003333333333333656,0.0003333333333333656,0.0003333333333333656,0.0003333333333333656,0.0003333333333333656,0.0003333333333333656,0.0003333333333333656,0.0003333333333333656,0.0003333333333333656,0.0003333333333333656,0.0003333333333333656,0.7481953996015195,0.03439099703795111,0.0003333333333333656,0.0003333333333333656,0.0003333333333333656,0.0003333333333333656,0.0003333333333333656,0.0003333333333333656,0.0003333333333333656,0.026669772023118817,0.0003333333333333656,0.0003333333333333656,0.0003333333333333656,0.0003333333333333656,0.0003333333333333656,0.0003333333333333656,0.0003333333333333656,0.0003333333333333656,0.0003333333333333656,0.0003333333333333656,0.0003333333333333656,0.0003333333333333656,0.0003333333333333656,0.04166098270915467,0.0003333333333333656,0.0003333333333333656,0.04977503403972552,0.0003333333333333656,0.0003333333333333656,0.0003333333333333656,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0

Other than that , the first half of the movie is a total BORE . All the first half of the movie is about is Rishi Kapoor falling head over heels in love with Juhi Chawla . By the way , do n't you think he 's a little old for her???Things finally start to spice up towards the middle of the film when Juhi tells us about her previous husband ; and wow what a lunatic is he ! He was an over - protective , neat - freak with a really HOT TEMPER ! He used to beat up poor Juhi for no good reason ! One of the reasons I really do n't like this movie is because I ca n't stand to see Juhi ( my favorite actress ) get so abused .

Then , the victims were invited to the "" reunion "" in an abandoned school which still had all the utilities turned on .

17230,0,"The movie opens with a flashback to Doddsville County High School on April Fool 's Day . A group of students play a prank on class nerd Marty . When they are punished for playing said prank , they follow up with a bigger prank which ( par for the course in slasher films involving pranks on class nerds ) goes ridiculously awry leaving Marty simultaneously burned by fire and disfigured by acid for the sake of being thorough . Fast forward five years , where we find members of the student body gathering at the now abandoned high school for their five year class reunion . We find out that it is no coincidence that everyone at the reunion belonged to the clique of pranksters from the flashback scene , as all of the attendees are being stalked and killed by a mysterious , jester mask - clad murderer in increasingly complicated and mind - numbingly ludicrous fashions . It does n't take Sherlock Holmes to solve the mystery of the killer 's identity , as it is revealed to be none other than a scarred Marty who has seemingly been using his nerd rage and high intellect to bend the laws of physics and engineering in order to rig the school for his revenge scenario . The film takes a turn for the bizarre as Marty finishes exacting his revenge on his former tormentors , only to be haunted by their ghosts . Marty is finally pushed fully over the edge and takes his own life . Finally , the film explodes in a crescendo of disjointed weirdness as the whole revenge scenario is revealed to be a dream in the first place as Marty wakes up in a hospital bed , breaks free of his restraints , stabs a nurse , and finally disfigures his own face . The script is tired and suffers from a terminal case of horror movie logic . The only originality comes from the mind - numbingly convoluted ways that the victims are dispatched . The absurd it - was - all - a - dream ending feels tacked on . It 's almost as if someone pointed out the disjointed nature of the film and the writer decided then and there that it was a dream . Technically speaking , the film is atrocious . Some scenes were filmed so dark that I had to pause the film and play with the color on my television . The acting is sub - par , even for slasher films . I ca n't help but think that casting was a part of the problem as all of the actors look at least five years older than the characters they portray , which makes the flashback scene even more unintentionally laughable . Their lack of commitment to the movie is made obvious as half of them ca n't bother to keep their accents straight through the movie . All of this being said , if you like bad horror movies , you might like this one , too . It is n't the worst film of the genre , but it 's far from the best .",534,0,0.07163833735532633,0.00024390243902441556,0.00024390243902441556,0.00024390243902441556,0.00024390243902441556,0.00024390243902441556,0.00024390243902441556,0.00024390243902441556,0.06982083876024632,0.00024390243902441556,0.00024390243902441556,0.00024390243902441556,0.00024390243902441556,0.00024390243902441556,0.01241824498870178,0.00024390243902441556,0.00024390243902441556,0.00024390243902441556,0.00024390243902441556,0.00024390243902441556,0.23048230505877962,0.00024390243902441556,0.00024390243902441556,0.00024390243902441556,0.014073529356008524,0.09072444702036127,0.00024390243902441556,0.00024390243902441556,0.00024390243902441556,0.04284201491528356,0.00024390243902441556,0.00024390243902441556,0.05258154742738986,0.00024390243902441556,0.00024390243902441556,0.00024390243902441556,0.00024390243902441556,0.00024390243902441556,0.00024390243902441556,0.00024390243902441556,0.031647825623772524,0.00024390243902441556,0.013153038168801392,0.32916092941358827,0.00024390243902441556,0.03218864922881292,0.00024390243902441556,0.00024390243902441556,0.00024390243902441556,0.00024390243902441556,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0
17330,0,"There can be no questions of spoilers for this movie , the director beat us all too and spoiled this movie in oh so many ways . A blatant rip - off of stuff like Critters and Gremlins , this movie fails on so many levels to recapture the humour and horror of those better made films . It ends up a sleazy waste of time , where bad actors deliver bad dialogue in front of an idiot director , who occasionally tosses stuffed toys at them . They wrestle with said toys in much the same manner as old Tarzan films used to use rubber crocodiles , shaking them whilst screaming and trying their best to make it look slightly threatening . It 's painful to watch , and not helped by the mental 80 's fashions worn by the cast . Basically , some crazy little aliens who have been trapped by an aging security guard in a film lot finally get free after umpteen years confinement , and begin to telepathically screw around with peoples minds . The guards new recruit , the idiot who let them out despite repeated warnings , gets his gang of 80 's friends together and they go off and have minor adventures together while trying to recapture the Grem ... Hobgoblins . All life is here , with the gang consisting of a knucklehead jock , his 80 's slut girlfriend , the ' hero 's frigid and prissy girlfriend , and the young hero , lacking in confidence and wishing his girlfriend would put out anyway . First off comes the infamous rake fighting scene , where the ex - military jock shows how he was trained in the army to be a bully , poking the nerdy hero with the wrong end of a rake for what seems like hours . Then there 's some running around , terminating in a real pie - fight style ending in a scuzzy nightclub with comedy hand - grenades blowing up everything except the people standing right next to them . Then the film sorta ends , and alls well that ends well . It 's not . This is like watching a train wreck , you ca nt take your eyes off it , it 's so bad . Perfect fare for Mystery Science Theater , but god - awful should you try to watch it alone and uncut . The Fashion Police still have a number of outstanding warrants for the cast , and I dare anyone not to laugh in outright derision at the rake fight .

17528,0,"DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE IF YOU LOVED THE CLASSICS SUCH AS TOM WOPAT , JOHN SCHNEIDER , CATHERINE BACH , SORRELL BOOKE , JAMES BEST , DENVER PYLE , SONNY SHROYER , AND BEN JONES ! THIS MOVIE WILL DISSAPPOINT YOU BADLY ! First of all , this movie starts out with Bo and Luke running moonshine for Jesse . Bo and Luke would not do that ever on the real series ! This movie portrays unimaginable characters doing things that never would have happened in the series . In the series , Uncle Jesse was honest , and law - abiding . In this movie , he is a criminal who is making moonshine and smoking weed with the governor of Georgia . Plus , if this was an extension adding on to the Dukes of Hazzard Reunion ! and the Dukes of Hazzard in Hollywood , I have one question : HOW COULD UNCLE JESSE BE MAKING MOONSHINE WHEN HE DIED BEFORE THE DUKES OF HAZZARD IN Hollywood MOVIE ? AND HOW IS BOSS HOGG ALIVE WHEN HE DIED BEFORE THE REUNION MOVIE IN 1997 ! MOVIE AND ROSCO RAN HAZZARD ? IT SEEMS MAGICAL THAT THESE CHARACTERS CAME BACK TO LIFE , WHEN THEY HAVE BEEN DEAD FOR 11 AND 8 YEARS ? If Hollywood really wanted to make a good movie , they should have brought back James Best , John Schneider , Tom Wopat , Ben Jones , and Catherine Bach like they did in 1997 and 2000 and made a family friendly movie with the living original characters that made the show what it was and still is compared to this disgusting , disgraced movie ! If you want to see good Dukes movies , either buy the original series , or go out to walmart.com and buy the DVD set of 2 that includes the Reunion , and Dukes of Hazzard in Hollywood movies ! They both star the original cast , and are family friendly ! Do n't waste your time on a movie that is n't worth the CD it 's written on !",354,0,0.00030303030303032455,0.00030303030303032455,0.00030303030303032455,0.00030303030303032455,0.00030303030303032455,0.00030303030303032455,0.00030303030303032455,0.00030303030303032455,0.00030303030303032455,0.00030303030303032455,0.00030303030303032455,0.00030303030303032455,0.00030303030303032455,0.00030303030303032455,0.018230964496681937,0.00030303030303032455,0.00030303030303032455,0.09527754762521015,0.00030303030303032455,0.00030303030303032455,0.7009461037731743,0.00030303030303032455,0.00030303030303032455,0.1165210501641211,0.00030303030303032455,0.00030303030303032455,0.00030303030303032455,0.00030303030303032455,0.00030303030303032455,0.00030303030303032455,0.00030303030303032455,0.00030303030303032455,0.00030303030303032455,0.00030303030303032455,0.00030303030303032455,0.00030303030303032455,0.00030303030303032455,0.00030303030303032455,0.00030303030303032455,0.03537650774942282,0.020314492858055276,0.00030303030303032455,0.00030303030303032455,0.00030303030303032455,0.00030303030303032455,0.00030303030303032455,0.00030303030303032455,0.00030303030303032455,0.00030303030303032455,0.00030303030303032455,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
17553,0,"When I heard that the Dukes of Hazzard was going to be remade with current actors and a solid script , I was like , "" alright , I 'll give it a chance , it 's not going to be better than the first , but we 'll see what happens . "" Well , I saw what happened . I saw a great late 70's/80 's show that was a classic , basically humiliated by Hollywood . It 's so sad to see that Hollywood scriptwriters can not come up with something original these days . They are seeming to take a great show that had a great target audience , and try to "" REMAKE "" the classic show . HEADS UP Hollywood ... IT AIN'T WORKIN ! ! ! ! Anyway , more about the show . I think they could have casted a better actor than Sean William Scott ( Stiffler from American Pie ) to play Bo . I 'm sure that John Schneider is definitely disappointed with how his character was portrayed and taken advantage of . Also , Get for real , Johnny Knoxville , as Luke Duke . How low can you go ? ? A crappy jackass actor to play lovable Luke . This sickens me . Also , I 'll give Jessica Simpson is a beautiful woman , but her acting sucks . Catherine Bach who played the original Daisy , was smart , sexy , strong , opinionated and a good IL ' southern girl . She was every little girls role model growing up ! ( I owned the doll and the Jeep - thank you very much ! ! ! ) Anyway , Jessica Simpson played a smart ass , 2-bit slut as Daisy Duke . Daisy never was blonde . Why did they have to cast her . Jessica Alba would have played a great Daisy Duke . She can speak with a great southern accent , and she is gorgeous , and would have done a wonderful job . Anyway , I 'd like to say that this movie blew something fierce . I feel like I got ripped off by paying $ 8.50 for tickets , and they should refund my money . If you like the Dukes of Hazzard ( the original series ) do n't see this movie . It 'll just upset you . CMT ( country music television ) plays the reruns of the Dukes all the time later at night . So set your TIVO 's and go with the real thing , not the imitation on the big screen in Hollywood .",445,0,0.00023255813953491068,0.00023255813953491068,0.00023255813953491068,0.015836187781541035,0.06480808103684658,0.00023255813953491068,0.00023255813953491068,0.00023255813953491068,0.03905036089135492,0.00023255813953491068,0.00023255813953491068,0.011865034498195778,0.00023255813953491068,0.00023255813953491068,0.00023255813953491068,0.00023255813953491068,0.00023255813953491068,0.00023255813953491068,0.00023255813953491068,0.00023255813953491068,0.587718932228532,0.04162993231450286,0.00023255813953491068,0.01824368674350871,0.00023255813953491068,0.01266898372254464,0.029098951695671442,0.00023255813953491068,0.00023255813953491068,0.016137825911170193,0.00023255813953491068,0.011864474115159099,0.00023255813953491068,0.00023255813953491068,0.00023255813953491068,0.00023255813953491068,0.00023255813953491068,0.00023255813953491068,0.00023255813953491068,0.01251274727998525,0.00023255813953491068,0.00023255813953491068,0.00023255813953491068,0.00023255813953491068,0.1299601506181959,0.00023255813953491068,0.00023255813953491068,0.00023255813953491068,0.00023255813953491068,0.00023255813953491068,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0
17714,0,"I rented this film purely on the fact that the cover appealed to me . However as soon as the film began I had regrets . It seems they used a home video camera to shoot this film and let a young child do it . They also used inappropriate ghostly faces and shapes to try and scare people but i found myself laughing , i could have put that together myself and done a better job of it . As for the plot I felt that it had some really good ideas but because of dodgy lines and in some cases acting they were overshadowed . It had no direction . I did n't want to sit through it all because it caused me physical pain to watch it but i always finish what i start so i took a deep breath and let it carry on . Definitely 98minutes of my life wasted . I would save yourself the embarrassment of knowing that you have watched ' Haunted Boat ' and find something that is more entertaining . I 'm a fan of low budget horror films but this was a major disappointment i thought nothing could get worse after ' Terror Toons ' but this made me reconsider .

I agree with many : some of the actresses who spend a lot of time topless and ( go - go ) dancing are not really that attractive . I kinda liked Fraulein Crank(?) ... she was so homely , she was cute ! The acting was pretty stale , also , though delivering lines in a second language might have accounted for a lot of that problem . Trying to follow the plot was a major chore : was there one , really ? I do heartily agree with one other comment : for a vampire movie , there 's not much blood . Yep , if you want GOOD bloodsucking flicks , check out such Hammer classics as "" Horror of Dracula "" and ( my personal favourite ) "" Brides of Dracula"" . The most ( unintentionally ) humorous part is where the lady doctor gets her clothes torn off by a cloud of bats ... which you never SEE! ... the bats , I mean . Okay as a time - waster if you happen to catch it on cable here in the Great White North but , for heaven 's sake , do n't rent it !",240,0,0.0005882352941177086,0.0005882352941177086,0.021663727575090205,0.0005882352941177086,0.04234465703243689,0.0005882352941177086,0.0005882352941177086,0.0005882352941177086,0.0005882352941177086,0.0005882352941177086,0.0005882352941177086,0.0005882352941177086,0.09977331709748706,0.0005882352941177086,0.0005882352941177086,0.0005882352941177086,0.06786916362770277,0.03396113891582312,0.0005882352941177086,0.0005882352941177086,0.0005882352941177086,0.4222141881862482,0.04049142254501614,0.0005882352941177086,0.0005882352941177086,0.0005882352941177086,0.0005882352941177086,0.0005882352941177086,0.0005882352941177086,0.0005882352941177086,0.0005882352941177086,0.0005882352941177086,0.0005882352941177086,0.0005882352941177086,0.0005882352941177086,0.033395851303979734,0.0005882352941177086,0.057393537584449636,0.0005882352941177086,0.0005882352941177086,0.0005882352941177086,0.0005882352941177086,0.0005882352941177086,0.15736358436705775,0.0005882352941177086,0.0005882352941177086,0.0005882352941177086,0.0005882352941177086,0.0005882352941177086,0.0005882352941177086,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

Its not even close to MST3k level riffing , or midnight viewing at a theatre , or even as Disney channel late night filler . The only time I 've ever wanted to jump off a ride at Disney World ( or Disney / MGM Studios in this case ) was to grab Dick Tracey 's jacket off the mannequin , rip it to shreds , and ram it down the tour guides throat saying "" Eat this ! Eat this unholy coat of darkness ! ! ! "" I 've never been so mad at a movie , not even "" Nutty Professor II : The Klumps "" or "" Flash Gordon "" . You want pretty colors and cinematography ? Ai n't here babe . Reviewers keep saying "" oh , but its too look like a comic book "" , well , to me , its the color of a Gordito after several weeks in the sun . About as enjoyable too .

Single - malt , if you can manage it . If the previous comments were n't enough to keep you from watching this film sober , allow me to assist . NASA sends one man and two unpaid extras into space to orbit Saturn . A really big solar flare causes Colonel Steve West to bleed from the nose . Things go downhill from there , and wackiness ensues . I actually read the book adaptation , which was published and released only in the UK . MILES better than the film , and the book was dreadful . At least some pretense is made towards suspense , and some sort of explanation of events is pulled out from the author 's ( rhymes with ' gas').Not to say that the film is completely without merit . Rick Baker learned that he really ought to read a contract before signing on to a film , and Jonathan Demme found that he 's really better suited to direct . Yes , there is an MST3 K episode featuring this flick , but it is , of course , edited quite a bit . Without the obligatory flashing of the breasts , not even the healing power of scotch can save you . Please , just go watch Raiders of the Lost Ark if you want to see a guy melt .

18305,0,"1st watched 12/7/2002 - 3 out of 10(Dir - Steve Purcell ) : Typical Mary Kate & Ashley fare with a few more kisses . It looks to me like the girls are getting pretty tired of this stuff and it will be interesting what happens to them if they ever decide to split up and go there own ways . In this episode of their adventures they are interns in Rome for a ` fashion ' designer who puts them right into the mailroom to learn what working hard is all about(I guess .. ) . Besides the typical flirtations with boys there is nothing much else except the Rome scenario until about ¾ way into the movie when it 's finally revealed why they are getting fired , then re - hired , then fired again , then re - hired again . This is definetly made by people who do n't understand the corporate world and it shows in their interpretation of it . Maybe the real world will be their next adventure(if there is one . ) . Even my kids did n't seem to care for this boring ` adventure ' in the make - believe . Let 's see they probably only have a couple of years till their legal adults .

18486,0,"I have a high tolerance level for crap , so I was looking forward to this . It did not disappoint . Apparently based on Sheridan Le Fanu 's classic Carmilla , it follows a father and daughter hunting a female vampire who , luckily , happens to be travelling with them . Then we have Santa Claus ( or the General , as he likes to be called here ) running over random zombies . Did I mention there was a zombie outbreak ? The dead are returning to life but nobody seems too concerned . We have construction worker zombies , soldier zombies and even St . Trinian schoolgirl zombies . Apparently Santa Claus is looking for his daughter who has been turned into a vampire . Oh wait there are no vampires , the girl is in a lunatic asylum and Carmilla is her nurse , or is she ? The zombies are back and Santa 's mad . Lesbian sex , I like vampires and I like zombies but I especially like lesbian sex . Nothing like some simulated cunnilingus to get the juices flowing . When are we going to see vampires fight zombies ? Is she a vampire or is she a lunatic ? Or both ? Is Carmilla a hot sexy lesbian vampire or a nurse ? More cunnilingus , you can never have enough cunnilingus . Here come the St . Trinian zombies . Chainsaw time ! ! More lesbian sex then the zombies kill and eat the vampires . I guess the zombies won , or did they ? Plot ? Who needs a plot when you 've got lesbian vampires and schoolgirl zombies ?

18508,0,"The above seemed a much more appropriate title when me and my suicidal underlings decided to watch this masterpiece of modern bullshit Erotic , Scary , Suspenseful , Well thought out , these are all the things this film fails to be . It is however incredibly funny , the slow sound effects and bad dubbing add to this to make one of the greatest comedies I have seen in recent years . And yet this film does n't even try to be funny and that is one of the movies grand achievements , it becomes a comedy without even attempting to amuse . Throughout the film an old guy who looks amazingly like Santa Claus goes around ploughing over zombies and smashing vampires into the ground . This made me fail to believe the films title , if this was vampires vs zombies why were the vampires and zombies not fighting ? Oh well whatever , besides there were more flaws to this rental than the title . Such as this one ; there has been a virus sweeping through America creating zombie like beings who go around acting a lot like your average tourist . And yet there 's only four zombies in the entire film . Another problem is besides one shop everywhere is deserted . Surely you 'd see zombies roaming about in the woods or in the background a bit . In fact I believe they just drove around in a circle of forest over and over again since they did n't have a high enough budget to film in a wider location , that or the director did n't want to waste his precious time filming in different areas of wood he was to busy sitting in a trailer jerking off to be bothered with such trivial matters . In fact the director had so much fun doing this that he did n't have enough time to hire a big enough cast or even an editor . And so he told the eight members of the cast to dress up as different people and try not to act inconspicuous , whilst I assume he changed his name and began randomly snipping at the film reels "" editing is n't a hard job anyway right ? "" The only reason this "" movie "" found it 's way into our bag was because somehow we got it confused with Freddy vs Jason , strange how these things happen is n't it . And the only way we made it though the night was by strapping gas masks on and bolting them to our skulls to avoid the stink of this nauseating mess . Oh yes we did laugh at the end , but I 'm sure one does that a lot when he has lost his sanity ...................",473,0,0.00023255813953490832,0.00023255813953490832,0.00023255813953490832,0.00023255813953490832,0.00023255813953490832,0.00023255813953490832,0.011862281508264528,0.00023255813953490832,0.00023255813953490832,0.00023255813953490832,0.00023255813953490832,0.00023255813953490832,0.2616052895987911,0.00023255813953490832,0.00023255813953490832,0.00023255813953490832,0.00023255813953490832,0.00023255813953490832,0.00023255813953490832,0.00023255813953490832,0.47092095095515946,0.00023255813953490832,0.00023255813953490832,0.00023255813953490832,0.00023255813953490832,0.01095841638174147,0.00023255813953490832,0.00023255813953490832,0.011890750234466525,0.00023255813953490832,0.00023255813953490832,0.00023255813953490832,0.00023255813953490832,0.00023255813953490832,0.00023255813953490832,0.00023255813953490832,0.00023255813953490832,0.00023255813953490832,0.00023255813953490832,0.00023255813953490832,0.017871964269602036,0.00023255813953490832,0.00023255813953490832,0.20489034705197406,0.00023255813953490832,0.00023255813953490832,0.00023255813953490832,0.00023255813953490832,0.00023255813953490832,0.00023255813953490832,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

Granted , it was on Sci Fi , and I do n't watch much Sci Fi , but man , talk about a razor thin plot and two dimensional characters to the max . The characters were stereotypical and overdone , the plot and setting were unbelievable , the vampires were less intimidating , more funny - looking , the gore was unnecessary , the special effects were down - right horrible , and the ending ? Well , the only thing unpredictable about the ending was when suddenly the tomboy becomes a lesbian and starts to do it with the female vampire , which , by the way , is n't really all that hot considering it occurs for about three seconds , in which you 're closer to "" What the hell ?

18570,0,"The beginning of this movie is excellent with tremendous sound and some nice humor , but once the film changes into animation it quickly loses its appeal . One of the reasons that was so , at least for me , was that the colors in much of the animation are too muted , with too little contrast . It does n't look good , at least on VHS . Once in a while it breaks out and looks great , but not often Also , the characters come and go too quickly . For example , I would have liked to have seen more of "" Moby Dick .

Additional notes ; Joe 's Bar ( Jed 's Tavern in the film ) , original name of the film was Welcome to Buzzsaw - the Old Erba 's parking lot was the town square , the backyard shots were off of Grove Street in Boulder Creek ; turn off the thinking cap and see a few actors in their early days .",207,0,0.000689655172413859,0.09558871860550619,0.04437190471286472,0.000689655172413859,0.000689655172413859,0.000689655172413859,0.000689655172413859,0.000689655172413859,0.000689655172413859,0.000689655172413859,0.000689655172413859,0.000689655172413859,0.000689655172413859,0.000689655172413859,0.000689655172413859,0.000689655172413859,0.000689655172413859,0.000689655172413859,0.000689655172413859,0.06273437196403711,0.2512013849749926,0.000689655172413859,0.000689655172413859,0.000689655172413859,0.000689655172413859,0.000689655172413859,0.000689655172413859,0.000689655172413859,0.000689655172413859,0.000689655172413859,0.000689655172413859,0.000689655172413859,0.000689655172413859,0.000689655172413859,0.000689655172413859,0.000689655172413859,0.000689655172413859,0.000689655172413859,0.000689655172413859,0.000689655172413859,0.000689655172413859,0.036242929563626215,0.000689655172413859,0.4795158625927633,0.000689655172413859,0.000689655172413859,0.000689655172413859,0.000689655172413859,0.000689655172413859,0.000689655172413859,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

18725,0,"If you have seen Friends , the writing will feel very familiar . Especially the last 3 or 4 seasons of Friends often share the same comedy setups . The show is about a group of people whose connection is that they shared the same class when they were still rather young ( about 10 years old I think ) . Now , they 're in their mid - twenties , and they meet again on a class reunion . This is where the series starts . A typical episode deals with multiple story lines at once . They 're usually not connected in any way . Each story line is cut up into multiple sections , which are then shown in a mixed order . The sketches is where my problems lie with this series . As in the later seasons of Friends , it 's often a rather silly setting with hard to believe situations . One of the main characters does something really stupid that 's hard to believe . The situation is then heavily exaggerated , as if it was n't silly enough . If you 're into this kind of in - your - face humor , then maybe you 'll like this series . For me it is a great turn - off . The reason I started watching Friends is because of the first few seasons . There are interesting and especially credible story lines , with some romance in it that makes you root for the characters . The Class has none of this . The characters are simply too forced and stereotypes are pushed too far . It 's therefore not possible to relate to them and like them . At least with friends , it took several seasons before it ran out of steam and the character traits were all milked out . But in The Class , it seems it has run out of steam before it even started .",331,0,0.00028985507246379885,0.00028985507246379885,0.00028985507246379885,0.00028985507246379885,0.00028985507246379885,0.014852503629960009,0.00028985507246379885,0.06170119992434302,0.00028985507246379885,0.00028985507246379885,0.00028985507246379885,0.00028985507246379885,0.00028985507246379885,0.00028985507246379885,0.00028985507246379885,0.00028985507246379885,0.00028985507246379885,0.00028985507246379885,0.00028985507246379885,0.00028985507246379885,0.41579736032921794,0.00028985507246379885,0.00028985507246379885,0.0654860770709661,0.00028985507246379885,0.00028985507246379885,0.03422050732860299,0.00028985507246379885,0.00028985507246379885,0.06573377338741258,0.00028985507246379885,0.00028985507246379885,0.03262399636586873,0.00028985507246379885,0.1526992989599392,0.016390355912190183,0.00028985507246379885,0.00028985507246379885,0.00028985507246379885,0.00028985507246379885,0.015867094147410055,0.00028985507246379885,0.11332348511800125,0.00028985507246379885,0.00028985507246379885,0.00028985507246379885,0.00028985507246379885,0.00028985507246379885,0.00028985507246379885,0.00028985507246379885,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
18808,0,"Final Score ... who cares - it 's a reality show . It has no love for it 's audience , it panders to lazy TV viewers , puts nothing in and gets nothing out . ""Joe Millionaire "" , the most blatantly phony reality show of them all , is a television disaster of epic proportions . It 's a watershed , rock bottom moment , not only for Fox , but for the American viewing public who actually watch , like and talked about this crap the next day . You people ought to be ashamed of yourselves . Because as much as Fox promotes this junk it wo n't make any money unless it 's watch by people ( and boy was it , the finale got nearly Super Bowl numbers ! ? ) . It does n't bother you people that there are many quality shows written , directed , acted and generally have effort put into them that are being cancelled while you sit back and lap up this effortless , cold game show?I used to be a staunch supporter of Fox . It 's those of us like me who like and seek out quality TV that helped build Fox back in the days of Married ... with Children and The Simpsons . Conveniently enough , now neither of those shows would make it 6 weeks with the current management . The Gail Berman "" reign of terror "" as it 's often called . The network has waged war on scripted TV AND , strangely enough , it 's fans . The very people who helped build them in the beginning . Now , not only do we have to fight for good shows , but we have to fight against their own network . It boggles the mind . Nothing Fox , has done in the past 3 years makes any sense . From canceling hits like "" Titus "" , "" Futurama "" and "" John Doe "" ( NBC can renew "" Boomtown "" , but Fox ca n't lift it 's pitiful head to give the only decent show they had this season another shot ? ) . And the reason they can do all this : the success of junk like "" Joe Millionaire "" . They can now say "" We do n't need you TV fans , we have reality shows "" . They apparently seem to have no idea that the big audience the draw with this junk is fickle and WILL abandon them the second the next fad comes along . To alienate their base like this will eventually kill the network the way it has set back ABC.The show itself is a joke . Here we have a premise , in the now classic Fox gimmick , that promises us something different and edgy , but then delivers something not in any way different from "" The Bachelor "" or anything on the big 3 . Fox has gone mainstream . The finale and "" twist "" ( quote / unquote ) showed they have no ideas up their sleeve . Now we know that all these shows , no matter how different they look , will all end up the same cornball , fairy tale ending . We got to see a bunch of lame aspiring actors that the network picked out of millions of head - shots to fit their demographics parade around like high school bimbos pretending they liked this Evan Marriott because ... well because it was a competition and that 's what you 're supposed to do . Marriott himself is like a hideously disfigured Chro - magnum man who struggles to put together the simplest sentences . But , how can the women ( all average to ugly looking by the way - an important minus is a guilty pleasure show like this ) not fall for "" Joe "" with such charming lines like "" Look , you 're not stupid"" . I used to think that people who watched these reality / dating / game shows were just to lazy to change the channel , but after "" Joe Millionaire "" I think they must be genuinely mentally deficient . Come on people , have a little more pride in yourselves . Demand a little bit more from your entertainment then THIS.Boycott FOX .",739,0,0.4001987679417772,0.00017241379310346374,0.03194010773135356,0.00017241379310346374,0.00017241379310346374,0.00017241379310346374,0.00017241379310346374,0.0737436723655443,0.00017241379310346374,0.00017241379310346374,0.00017241379310346374,0.00017241379310346374,0.00017241379310346374,0.00017241379310346374,0.00017241379310346374,0.00017241379310346374,0.00017241379310346374,0.00017241379310346374,0.00017241379310346374,0.00017241379310346374,0.15580578879467005,0.03183223578434234,0.00017241379310346374,0.07499380185283329,0.03517885650737409,0.04622959530673873,0.00017241379310346374,0.00017241379310346374,0.00017241379310346374,0.013240988489881098,0.00017241379310346374,0.04383739289488031,0.00017241379310346374,0.00017241379310346374,0.016036456890122935,0.014365884867860985,0.00017241379310346374,0.00017241379310346374,0.00017241379310346374,0.011100416596640614,0.011730991857309928,0.00017241379310346374,0.00017241379310346374,0.00017241379310346374,0.00017241379310346374,0.00017241379310346374,0.03373055936004939,0.00017241379310346374,0.00017241379310346374,0.00017241379310346374,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

19080,0,"This movie has some beautiful sets and Albert Finney does a great job as the ruthless father . The movie fails because Jennifer Jason Leigh is too jumpy as the daughter and is no match whatever for Olivia De Havilland 's far more nuanced , mature rendering in The Heiress ( 1949 ) . The film 's feminist - leaning conclusion also goes against the austere conclusion of the novel , Washington Square , whose author , Henry James , savagely parodied feminism in some of his other novels . As a fan of old Hollywood and great literature , I found this movie very disappointing .",107,0,0.0010526315789474302,0.0010526315789474302,0.0010526315789474302,0.0010526315789474302,0.10365850398248737,0.0010526315789474302,0.0010526315789474302,0.0010526315789474302,0.03687693629153862,0.0010526315789474302,0.0010526315789474302,0.0010526315789474302,0.0010526315789474302,0.0010526315789474302,0.0010526315789474302,0.0010526315789474302,0.08248196145605478,0.0010526315789474302,0.0010526315789474302,0.0010526315789474302,0.2867078709593483,0.0010526315789474302,0.0010526315789474302,0.09540884992933989,0.0010526315789474302,0.0010526315789474302,0.0010526315789474302,0.0010526315789474302,0.0010526315789474302,0.0010526315789474302,0.0010526315789474302,0.0010526315789474302,0.05406547357326242,0.0010526315789474302,0.0010526315789474302,0.0010526315789474302,0.10953298912879882,0.0010526315789474302,0.0010526315789474302,0.0010526315789474302,0.0010526315789474302,0.10741815874853577,0.0010526315789474302,0.08069136119378932,0.0010526315789474302,0.0010526315789474302,0.0010526315789474302,0.0010526315789474302,0.0010526315789474302,0.0010526315789474302,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1
19208,0,"In the third entry of the Phantasm series , Mike and Reggie continue chasing the Tall Man , assisted by a trigger - happy 9 year old , a black G.I. Jane and the spirit of Mike 's deceased brother ( he died in the original Phantasm ) . Number 3 is a rather disappointing sequel , since the gore and black comedy is a lot less inspired and exciting as it was in Phantasm II . I got the feeling the stress was merely laid on Reggie 's incompetence as a lover and his talent as stand - up comedian . The humor in the previous film was a lot more dry and oppressed , which fits a story like this better . Also , the settings are n't as macabre here , plus the constant presence of the Tall Man ( Agnus Schrim ) is n't as obvious There still is plenty of gore but not half as satisfying this time . By the way , beware for the severely cut version as it shows most delightful killings off - screen . The entire Phantasm series is the lifetime achievement of Don Coscarelli , who wrote and directed 4 episodes so far the fifth being in production . The first one is a semi - cult classic , the second is a horror - feast of gore and violence and the rest can easily be skipped . A. Michael Baldwin returns as Mike , even though James LeGros portrayed his character a lot better in Phantasm II .",260,0,0.12561151423292496,0.00046511627906980444,0.00046511627906980444,0.00046511627906980444,0.00046511627906980444,0.00046511627906980444,0.00046511627906980444,0.00046511627906980444,0.08188532683883762,0.00046511627906980444,0.00046511627906980444,0.00046511627906980444,0.00046511627906980444,0.00046511627906980444,0.02370969611900383,0.00046511627906980444,0.00046511627906980444,0.00046511627906980444,0.00046511627906980444,0.00046511627906980444,0.13751467199830444,0.00046511627906980444,0.00046511627906980444,0.23159949679536998,0.029484460724225992,0.00046511627906980444,0.00046511627906980444,0.00046511627906980444,0.00046511627906980444,0.00046511627906980444,0.00046511627906980444,0.00046511627906980444,0.06990383396318178,0.00046511627906980444,0.00046511627906980444,0.1835484598555024,0.00046511627906980444,0.00046511627906980444,0.00046511627906980444,0.00046511627906980444,0.00046511627906980444,0.00046511627906980444,0.00046511627906980444,0.09767277203078702,0.00046511627906980444,0.00046511627906980444,0.00046511627906980444,0.00046511627906980444,0.00046511627906980444,0.00046511627906980444,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

19686,0,"Meet Peter Houseman , rock star genetic professor at Virgina University . When he 's not ballin ' on the court he 's blowing minds and dropping panties in his classroom lectures . Dr. Houseman is working on a serum that would allow the body to constantly regenerate cells allowing humans to become immortal . I 'd want to be immortal too if I looked like Christian Bale and got the sweet female lovin that only VU can offer . An assortment of old and ugly university professors do n't care for the popular Houseman and cut off funding for his project due to lack of results . This causes Peter to use himself as the guinea pig for his serum . Much to my amazement there are side effects and he , get this , metamorphoses ! into something that is embedded into our genetic DNA that has been repressed for "" millions of years "" . He also beds Dr. Mike 's crush Sally after a whole day of knowing her . She has a son . His name is Tommy . He is an angry little boy . Metamorphosis is n't a terrible movie , just not a well produced one . The whole time I watched this I could n't get past the fact that this was filmed in 1989 . The look and feel of the movie is late seventies quality at the latest . It does not help that it 's packaged along with 1970 's movies as Metamorphosis is part of mill creek entertainment 's 50 chilling classics . There is basically no film quality difference whatsoever . The final five minutes are pure bad movie cheese that actually , for me at least , save the movie from a lower rating . Pay attention to the computer terminology such as "" cromosonic anomaly "" . No wonder Peter 's experiment failed . Your computer ca n't spell !

19781,0,"Dewaana as a film goes through the usual clichés . Man and Woman fall in love and marry , husband is supposedly killed by a family friend who wants their family fortune , woman remarries and surprise surprise husband no.1 reappears . The movie is reminiscent of Yash Chopra 's Chandni and countless others . Divya Bharti and Shah Rukh Khan give good performances . Amrish Puri as a villain goes through the motions and is nothing more than a standard bollywood villain The music by Nadeem Shravan is superb , all the songs were brilliant . My favourites are Sochenge tumhe pyar or Koyi na koyi chahiyye .

20148,0,"Italian - born Eleonora has inherited from her deceased lover Karl , an ultra - modern and isolated house in the middle of the woods . It 's winter and she meets the mysterious caretaker Leslie , who eventually ends up not only just looking after the house , but also that of Eleonora , as she tries to adapt to her new surroundings and a growing attraction between the pair . What was I expecting ? A thriller indeed , but it was n't quite so . That 's just the advertising on the package for ya ! I 'm quite perplex about everything . The title , the story and the motivation . So how to classify it ? Well , this wooden character drama is more a enigmatically moody romance bound - story of alienation , possession and dependence twisted into a complicatedly passionate relationship of two masked individuals . Co - writer ( along with William Dafoe ) and director Giada Colagrande 's art - house film is just too clinical , distant and calculated with its mysteriously metaphoric story , which it leaves you questioning what does it all really mean although when its sudden conclusion materialises , you 'll thinking why should I actually care . What we go through feels aimless with ponderous exposition of dead air that focuses of insignificant details and images . Sterile dialogues can contributed to many awkward developments , but more so make for an leaden experience , as it never delves deep enough . Like it believes it does . The sexually salty activities filtered in just never convince and are far from erotic . They are kind of a bump in the already sluggish flow . The base of the plot makes for something interesting and fresh , but it 's never fulfilling and I thought there 'll be more to it then all of this dreary lingering . Colagrande 's direction is professionally stylish and suitably gloomy to want she imagines , but everything feels like it 's in slow motion and can get caught up admiring the same views . Most of the action stays at the one location the house . Camera - work is potently taut , but the sullen musical score can get a bit ridiculous when it goes for some dramatically stabbing music cues that served little sense and purpose to the scenes . Giada Colagrande plays it sensually and William Dafoe sleep walks the part . He looks dog tired ! While Seymour Cassel , pokes his head in now and then . Just where is it heading , is anyone 's guess . Well , that 's if you can wait around for it . I think I 'll give it the benefit of the doubt , as it 's definitely not what I was expecting from this Indie film .",483,0,0.23099858953282262,0.00031250000000003,0.00031250000000003,0.00031250000000003,0.00031250000000003,0.00031250000000003,0.00031250000000003,0.00031250000000003,0.00031250000000003,0.00031250000000003,0.00031250000000003,0.00031250000000003,0.14921054939912357,0.00031250000000003,0.00031250000000003,0.00031250000000003,0.00031250000000003,0.00031250000000003,0.00031250000000003,0.09322716764880792,0.00031250000000003,0.18990312434534976,0.00031250000000003,0.00031250000000003,0.00031250000000003,0.00031250000000003,0.00031250000000003,0.00031250000000003,0.00031250000000003,0.00031250000000003,0.00031250000000003,0.00031250000000003,0.00031250000000003,0.00031250000000003,0.00031250000000003,0.00031250000000003,0.00031250000000003,0.00031250000000003,0.00031250000000003,0.00031250000000003,0.00031250000000003,0.00031250000000003,0.00031250000000003,0.3225980690738949,0.00031250000000003,0.00031250000000003,0.00031250000000003,0.00031250000000003,0.00031250000000003,0.00031250000000003,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

20544,0,"I still have n't gotten to see all of this ; it 's running on cable right now , and I seem to keep coming in on the middle of it . My main reason for being interested in it is that I 'm a Bill Paxton fan ; he 's a pretty good actor , and has turned in consistently good work over the course of his career . The other thing is that , while never really a fan of the old series , I kinda liked Thunderbirds for the ships and effect work . Derek Meddings was quite possibly the best in the business during the sixties and seventies , and his designs for the International Rescue craft are wonderful . The current team has done a fine job of translating his work to the big screen . BUT ... This is one lame story . The kids are asked to drive it , and while they do an okay job , it 's hard to suspend your disbelief , especially when you have Brains ' eight - year - old son flying T2 , an enormous multi - ton transport with all the aerodynamics of a Buick . Everywhere you look , you see a Ford logo . Product placement is way over the top here , and it 's annoying . Ben Kingsley does an good job as The Hood , but he can only do so much with a one - dimensional role . If you can accept the film on its very slim merits , Thunderbirds is a fun , enjoyable ride . Just do n't look too closely at the machinery that drives it . ADDENDUM : I finally got to see all of this , and it 's worse than I thought . The acting is fairly uniformly poor , and while the effects are fairly good , the story on multiple viewings has gotten cheesier . The overdone product placement for Ford is annoying , and the kids as central characters grate on my remaining nerves . As with The Avengers , if you ignore the source material , it 's bearable . But not very . Watch the original show , and you 'll see what I mean . And a word of advice to Jon Frakes . Take a refresher course at the Director 's Guild . You can do better than this , old friend . Another footnote ... I saw this again . Last night . On Telemundo . Dubbed in Spanish , with cheesy comedy sound effects . And yes , I came in roughly in the middle , with Ben , Ron and Sophia in their fight scene on Tracy Island . I did n't think it was possible for an already lame movie to be worse , but it was . It was embarrassingly bad . If this had been done straight , no kids - to - the - rescue , no tongue - in - cheek jokes , it might have worked . As it is , it 's just another beloved childhood joy that 's been ruined .",528,0,0.00021739130434785052,0.00021739130434785052,0.00021739130434785052,0.00021739130434785052,0.00021739130434785052,0.033661027281522586,0.02676849217129168,0.00021739130434785052,0.00021739130434785052,0.00021739130434785052,0.03408804875477761,0.011786256678028809,0.00021739130434785052,0.00021739130434785052,0.01108695648221118,0.00021739130434785052,0.06737148949555088,0.01437899491854797,0.00021739130434785052,0.00021739130434785052,0.33671800464363644,0.16886676626407923,0.00021739130434785052,0.09326103152184723,0.00021739130434785052,0.00021739130434785052,0.017479458715010124,0.00021739130434785052,0.01211428770827366,0.00021739130434785052,0.00021739130434785052,0.00021739130434785052,0.07201708316699416,0.00021739130434785052,0.00021739130434785052,0.00021739130434785052,0.00021739130434785052,0.00021739130434785052,0.07042486210845723,0.00021739130434785052,0.00021739130434785052,0.022368544437596553,0.00021739130434785052,0.00021739130434785052,0.00021739130434785052,0.00021739130434785052,0.00021739130434785052,0.00021739130434785052,0.00021739130434785052,0.00021739130434785052,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
20573,0,"Never before have the motives of the producers of a motion picture been more transparent . Let 's see : FIRST , they get every willing televangelist to hype this film as the greatest thing since sliced white bread . NEXT , they encourage as many fundamentalist Christians as possible to purchase copies of the film so as to recoup its paltry production costs and pump up its advertising budget . And FINALLY , when the film hits the theaters , get as many said Christians as possible to see it yet again , bus them into the multiplexes if necessary , NOT on the merits of the film itself , but because a # 1 box office opening will be seen as some sort of profound spiritual victory . But THAT , of course , wo n't be enough . I imagine that any film critic with the audacity to give "" Left Behind "" anything short of a glowing review will be deemed "" anti - Christian . ""Of course , this shamelessly manipulative marketing campaign should n't surprise anyone . It is , after all , good old fashioned Capitalism at work . What DOES surprise me is how many people have been suckered into the whole "" Left Behind "" mindset . As someone who tries to balance his spiritual beliefs with some sense of reason and rationality , it leaves me scratching my head . It would appear that there are many , MANY people who actually believe that sometime in the near future a "" Rapture "" is going to occur , and that millions of people all over the Earth are going to simultaneously vanish INTO THIN AIR . What kind of reality , I wonder , are these people living in ? Is this "" Rapture "" something they actually believe in , or is it something they fervently WANT to believe in ? And when they reach the end of their lives and realize this "" Rapture "" has not occurred , will they be disappointed and disillusioned ? Will there still be people 100 years from now insisting that the "" Rapture "" is imminent?In a way , I almost wish that such an event would occur ! What an interesting day that would be ! What would be even more interesting is if the Apocalypse were to occur in a more spectacular fashion , not in the anthropological sense the authors of the "" Left Behind "" series have portrayed , but as more of a Stephen Spielberg production , with boiling clouds , trumpets , angels descending out of the sky , Moon turned to blood , the whole nine yards . Imagine coming to the realization that it was all coming true , just as the evangelists had been warning for years , and that there was something more awesome than just the cold , hard , physical reality we inhabit . Would n't THAT be something???Yet in the final analysis , it 's that cold , hard , physical reality that I will content myself with . My life is not so meaningless that I need the fear of a "" Rapture "" and the "" End Times "" to make sense of it all ... nor do I need Heaven or Hell to bribe or scare me into behaving decently , thank you very much .",571,0,0.17167493339660717,0.0002666666666666925,0.0002666666666666925,0.0002666666666666925,0.0002666666666666925,0.0002666666666666925,0.0002666666666666925,0.19550675766959,0.0002666666666666925,0.0002666666666666925,0.0002666666666666925,0.0002666666666666925,0.10946858985166856,0.0002666666666666925,0.0002666666666666925,0.0002666666666666925,0.0002666666666666925,0.0002666666666666925,0.0002666666666666925,0.0002666666666666925,0.0002666666666666925,0.0002666666666666925,0.0002666666666666925,0.024710558138524793,0.0002666666666666925,0.0002666666666666925,0.015075507894733478,0.0002666666666666925,0.0002666666666666925,0.0002666666666666925,0.0002666666666666925,0.0002666666666666925,0.0002666666666666925,0.0002666666666666925,0.0002666666666666925,0.014683223008117953,0.0002666666666666925,0.0002666666666666925,0.0002666666666666925,0.019751703936610444,0.06182814608415833,0.0002666666666666925,0.0002666666666666925,0.3163293689113347,0.06030454444198708,0.0002666666666666925,0.0002666666666666925,0.0002666666666666925,0.0002666666666666925,0.0002666666666666925,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0
21003,0,"When I saw this movie , circa 1979 , it became the first movie that I ever walked out of in the middle . There is nothing worse than comedy that just misses being funny , and this misses every time ( although I ca n't speak for the last 25 minutes of the movie ) . There was nothing original about any of the skits . While I enjoy racy humor where appropriate , these skits were needlessly vulgar . What was even more irritating was that this movie was advertised as "" Robin William 's first movie "" , capitalizing on his new found fame in the "" Mork and Mindy "" television series .

21081,0,"As a child the first installment ( "" The Little Mermaid "" ) was my favorite movie . It was filled with great characters , songs , and a fun family film . A week or so again I watched this movie for the first time . I believe that this movie was like most sequels and did n't surpass their original . I think that I feel this way possibly because I had high expectations and I have grown up . However , it is not a bad film . It starts when Ariel has just given birth to a beautiful child , Melody . Eric and Ariel feel threatened by Morgana ( Eurselas ' sister ) , so they build a large wall around their house which lies on the sea . As Melody grows up she begins to wonder outside of the walls where she is forbidden to go . Trouble stirs up as Morgana tries to take control of the seven seas . I do n't want to give away any of the movie so you have to see it to find out . I did like that the voices are the same and again wonderful singing .

Do n't waste your time even thinking about this attempt at acting .,83,0,0.0010526315789474723,0.0010526315789474723,0.0010526315789474723,0.06273787493404397,0.0010526315789474723,0.0010526315789474723,0.0010526315789474723,0.0010526315789474723,0.0010526315789474723,0.0010526315789474723,0.0010526315789474723,0.0010526315789474723,0.0010526315789474723,0.0010526315789474723,0.0010526315789474723,0.0010526315789474723,0.0010526315789474723,0.0010526315789474723,0.0010526315789474723,0.0010526315789474723,0.23546650395340582,0.0010526315789474723,0.0010526315789474723,0.0010526315789474723,0.0010526315789474723,0.05274890690000947,0.0010526315789474723,0.0010526315789474723,0.05368421052631984,0.0010526315789474723,0.0010526315789474723,0.0010526315789474723,0.0010526315789474723,0.0010526315789474723,0.0010526315789474723,0.0010526315789474723,0.0010526315789474723,0.0010526315789474723,0.0010526315789474723,0.14202419679844777,0.0010526315789474723,0.0010526315789474723,0.0010526315789474723,0.40702251741408446,0.0010526315789474723,0.0010526315789474723,0.0010526315789474723,0.0010526315789474723,0.0010526315789474723,0.0010526315789474723,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1

George is n't always funny , he sometimes acts stupid . His jokes are overdone . His mom is the silliest character of the show . How can a mother treat her own son that way , okay if it was the daughter in law , but this was her own son . I give this show a 4/10 just because the first few shows were a little funny . The actors Constance Marie and Masiela Lusha do a great job . Do n't know how these shows get to play for so long .

I 've seen Bollywood movies , and I 've seen satires of Bollywood movies . This movie could n't decide which one it wanted to be , so it ended up being a joke on itself . It seems to have been liberally copied from movies like Bride and Prejudice and Bollywood Calling , and what a sloppy , lazy job at that . How can Bollywood ever be weaned off of its determination to stick to overused , well - trodden scripts ? Is there no one who can bring to the screen the millions of real , fascinating stories that surely exist and transpire in the land of a billion people ? The over - smart auto driver , the cow on the street , gratuitous scenes of foreign locations , pointless scenes of Mumbai streets , they 're all in there . Every possible cliché about India has been faithfully included . So sickeningly predictable . ugh ! ! ! Acting performances are weak across the board except for Neha Dubey , who is talented and beautiful .

22804,0,"After watching this movie on DVD , I watched the trailer . The voice - over describes the movie as surreal . Well , there 's surreal , and there 's surreal . There was really only one part of the film that seemed surreal to me , but frankly , it was more confusing than surreal . The other unusual imagery , particularly the lunchroom scene where everybody is on the floor , were so nonsensical they had no meaning . I do n't mind imagery that does n't mean anything , but these scenes just seemed irrelevant . My impression is that the director was trying to convey Logan 's inner monologue . I do n't know what else would explain what was going on . Unfortunately , nothing I saw gave me any clue what Logan was thinking about , what his perspective was , or even his emotional state . All I could tell was that he was n't particularly happy with his physical appearance , and that he had a crush on an older boy . I thought the ending signaled what the relationship between the boys had become , but not much else did . Purposely juxtaposing ambiguous scenes with those that were more straightforward seemed more like a cop out than an artistic decision .

23415,0,"There is something in most of us , especially guys , that admires some really working class small town "" real men "" populist fare . And Sean Penn serves it up for us with a cherry on top . Hey , A lot of people use Penn as a political whipping boy , but I do n't rate movies or actor / directors based on politics or personality . That is what right wing commentators like excretable faux movie reviewer Debbie Schlussel does . While acknowledging he is one of our best actors and a good director , I think this picture was a simplistic piece of aimless dreck that he has atoned for since . Okay , you have the gist of this there is this good cop , a small town trooper , Joe , played against type by David Morse , who in the opening scene chases some guy on a country farm road in big sixties cars . The bad guy stops , gets out , shoots at him so Joe has to blast him dead . There was no explanation what drove this man to do such a desperate violent thing and the dead man 's parents do some redneck freak out at the police station while Joe feels real sad and guilty that he had to kill someone . So we know that Joe , the farmer forced off his land into a cop job , is a good basic sort of guy . Then his brother Frank shows up , he is a sadistic , amoral bully , fresh out of the Army and Nam where the war got his blood lust up . Some people here and in other reviews called him just an irresponsible hell raising younger brother and Sean was trying to make some point about what our John Wayne tough guy culture and war does to otherwise good people but what I saw was an amoral , sadistic bully who enjoys hurting and ripping people off . Then there is mom and dad , Marsha Mason and Charles Bronson , who do the requisite turn as old fashioned country couple , then die off ; she by illness and he by shotgun suicide , to advance the story for us . Both times Frank the bad guy is away being a miserable SOB . But good Joe brings him back to Podunksville from jail so Frank can straighten his life out by welding bridges and living with his utterly stupid screaming trashy pregnant wife . But Joe has a nice wife , played by Italian actress Valeria Golina , who is Mexican and Sean uses this as an exercise in some affirmative action embellishment of goody Joe and his real soulfulness underneath his uniform and crew cut . For me , that was an utterly pointless affirmative action subplot that Sean uses to burnish his tough guy creds by sucking up to Mexicans because Mexicans are so tough and cool . But Frank is bad and we get the requisite events like stealing friend 's car , robbing gas station by beating the clerk over the head then torching the car and all those cool things that hell raisers do . Then there are the mandatory 8 mm film childhood flashbacks of young Joey dutifully moving the lawn and cowboy dressed Franky jumping on his back and wrestling him and yadda yadda so we all know what deep bond there is between the two of them . So the film meanders around with a lot of small town schlock to warm the heart of any red stater . Accompanying the film was a great soundtrack of good sixties songs like Jefferson Airplane and Janis Joplin which were totally inappropriate , except for the 60 's era effect , to win the hearts of old hippies . The worst offense is that , since the movie was inspired by a Springsteen song , "" The Highway Patrolman "" , that song was not included . So Joe 's brain dead wife goes into labor and Joe runs off to the bar to get loaded and spout some populists drunken victim 's spiel about how tough things are while good Joey comes to drag him back to his wife . The bartender is good Ole Ceasar , played by Dennis Hopper . So Viggo - Frank whigs out for no particular reason and beats his pal Ceasar to death after good Joe the Cop leaves . So Joe has chase his bad brother down and I was so hoping that he would do the right thing and blow that menace to society away . Instead we get a scene where his brother stops ahead of him in some old 50 's junker on some lonely road at night , and little Franky in his cowboy suit and cap guns gets out of the car to face good Joe , the kid from the 8 mm flashback home movie sequence . Oy , such dreck ! Then to top off this drecky sap fest , there is some Zen crap about the Indian runner , who is a messenger , becomes the message , ala Marshall MacLuhen ? See what I mean , Sean has done much better than this so do n't be afraid to miss this one .",899,0,0.00014084507042254774,0.00014084507042254774,0.00014084507042254774,0.00014084507042254774,0.00014084507042254774,0.00014084507042254774,0.014330098863313325,0.17646447083104264,0.00014084507042254774,0.00014084507042254774,0.00014084507042254774,0.00014084507042254774,0.00014084507042254774,0.00014084507042254774,0.006646967070443089,0.00014084507042254774,0.23483635659909513,0.00014084507042254774,0.00014084507042254774,0.04246811297170345,0.29969395044859976,0.04630935831976783,0.00014084507042254774,0.01332191091960067,0.05271442040393584,0.00014084507042254774,0.00014084507042254774,0.00014084507042254774,0.00014084507042254774,0.03362273596435277,0.00014084507042254774,0.014560857191655735,0.00014084507042254774,0.00014084507042254774,0.020512821869437273,0.00014084507042254774,0.00014084507042254774,0.00014084507042254774,0.00014084507042254774,0.00014084507042254774,0.00014084507042254774,0.00014084507042254774,0.00014084507042254774,0.039306670941418084,0.00014084507042254774,0.00014084507042254774,0.00014084507042254774,0.00014084507042254774,0.00014084507042254774,0.00014084507042254774,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
23466,0,"A disappointing film . The story established our protagonist as Chrissy , a ' young ' , rather sullen individual drifting , not doing much .

23670,0,"I loved "" Anchorman ; The Legend of Ron Burgundy "" and hoped this would be just as funny , but alas , it was n't . Some bits are excellent though . I thought the sports guy , Champ Kind , professing his love for Ron Burgundy in the car filled with the other members of the news team was hilarious . Everyone is ignoring him and he just gets louder and louder and finally kisses Burgundy which does n't get acknowledged either . But on the whole the story does n't gel . It 's a noble attempt , however , to salvage the unused bits from the first movie , including an entire plot about some pretty benign would - be domestic terrorists called "" The Alarm Clock . "" Maya Rudolph of Saturday Night Live is one of the members and has a couple of funny lines , but basically this unused plot line has good reason to be unused in the first movie . The extras on this disk are pretty good , with the best two being the filmed rehearsals featuring lots of improv comedy , and the faux commentary with Will Ferrell and an "" exec producer "" who Ferrell discovers early on was not even a part of the movie in any way , shape or form . Turns out he 's "" just a guy "" who walked in the side door of the recording studio and pretended to be a producer .

23685,0,"No , I 've never seen any of the "" Santa Slasher "" series , i.e. ' Silent Night , Deadly Night , ' the original ' Black Christmas ' or this one , ' Christmas Evil . ' I 've heard all about their reputation , or , MADS ( Mothers Against Deranged Santas . ) I thought I would rent this one as I 've heard it pop up as a reference on a ' Fat Guys At the Movies ' segment . Mothers should be against this , but not for the ooooohhhh "" killer "" Santa , but for the fact this movie was just plain crap . Boring , long  even at only 92 minutes , crap . Little boy sees Santa arrive down a chimney in 1947 , deliver presents , eat some goodies and miraculously , float up the chimney . Boy goes to bed , but returns to living room to witness Mommy and Santa ( sort of ) getting it on . Apparently this messed up that kid for the rest of his life , though the scene was about as steamy as when Ralphie 's dad got the "" Leg Lamp "" in ' A Christmas Story . ' He was sooo disturbed , he went to the attic and , well cut his own hand . Fast forward to the future ! Now , it 's 1980 and messed up boy works in a toy factory . We get a whiff of him being a little off - kilter , and he stalks both kids and parents alike . Who 's naughty , who 's nice , blah blah . It takes a good two - thirds of the film to get him to finally snap  as if that 's not foreshadowed from frame one . NO MOVIE should take that long . I will admit , this movie had its tension building , but only because I kept expecting him to do something , anything to anyone . When he finally does , well , punish "" who 's naughty , "" it 's as graphic as a "" Garbage Pail Kid "" card . And I have n't mentioned the WTF ending . I 'm thinking it was a metaphor , but in reality , it 's just as weird as the rest of the movie . ( Take the brother who 's upset his sibling is killing , and his solution is uh , killing . ) Do n't open this mess , even on Christmas Eve , or Evil . Again , I did n't watch the other "" Santa - Slashers "" but this one sucked bad .

24472,0,"This utterly dull , senseless , pointless , spiritless , and dumb movie is n't the final proof that the world can forget about Danny Boyle and his post-""Trainspotting "" movies : "" The Beach "" already took care of that . What this low - budget oddity does is merely to secure his place among those who started very well but got completely lost in drugs , booze , ego , self - delusion , bad management or whatever it was that lead to this once - promising director 's quick demise . The premise is absurd : two losers ( Ecclestone and some bimbo Jenna G - a rapper , likely ) meet by chance and spontaneously start singing with fervour more akin to lunatic asylum inhabitants than a potential hit - making duo - which they become . A friend of theirs - an even bigger illiterate loser - becomes their manager by smashing a store window and stealing a video - camera by which he films them in "" action "" , and then shows the tape to some music people who actually show interest in this garbage . Now , I know that the UK in recent years has put out incredible junk , but this is ridiculous ; the music makes Oasis seem like The Beatles . During the studio recordings , the duo - Strumpet - change lyrics in every take and Ecclestone quite arrogantly tells the music biz guys to take it or leave it , and quite absurdly they do take it . Not only is the music total and utter trash , but its "" performers "" are anti - social ; these NEWCOMERS are supposed to be calling the shots . It 's just too dumb . It 's plain awful . The dialog is unfunny and goes nowhere , and this rags - to - bitches story has no point and makes no sense . It often feels improvised - under the influence of drugs . Danny Boyle is a complete idiot . This little piece of trash is so bad it 's embarrassing to watch . Ecclestone 's I.Q. also has to be questioned for agreeing to be part of this nonsense . Whoever financed this £ 1000 joke should leave the movie business before they end up selling their own underwear on street corners .",399,0,0.2129601942404172,0.0003448275862069472,0.0003448275862069472,0.0003448275862069472,0.0003448275862069472,0.0003448275862069472,0.0003448275862069472,0.0003448275862069472,0.0003448275862069472,0.0003448275862069472,0.0003448275862069472,0.0003448275862069472,0.0003448275862069472,0.0003448275862069472,0.014379278613489246,0.0003448275862069472,0.0449368971513434,0.0003448275862069472,0.0003448275862069472,0.0003448275862069472,0.29675526551122844,0.0003448275862069472,0.0003448275862069472,0.0003448275862069472,0.0003448275862069472,0.0003448275862069472,0.01467814557276392,0.0003448275862069472,0.07672680350220733,0.0003448275862069472,0.0003448275862069472,0.0003448275862069472,0.0003448275862069472,0.0003448275862069472,0.0003448275862069472,0.0003448275862069472,0.0003448275862069472,0.0003448275862069472,0.0003448275862069472,0.021775587610387736,0.038782163808984096,0.0003448275862069472,0.0003448275862069472,0.2263795283097536,0.0003448275862069472,0.03883303223114706,0.0003448275862069472,0.0003448275862069472,0.0003448275862069472,0.0003448275862069472,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0

The only thing I can admire is the acting of some characters . The movie was too bright , they should have done something with the lighting , eg . making the environment more darker . The make up on certain dead characters made this movie look like a 1970 horror flick . This is 2006 ! People do n't get scared by other people wearing heavy make up . Most of the horror scenes we 're taken from other Hollywood or Asian horror movies . Total rip off ! This is why I do n't watch tagalog movies . The only reason why so many people "" screamed "" while watching this movie is because of conformity .

24595,0,"This astonishing waste of production money is filmic proof that the rich and famous can be just as stupid and wasteful as politicians . From a ( silly ) play by Tennessee Williams and directed ( with a dead hand ) by Joseph Losey and starring Taylor and Burton and Noel Coward - this project filmed in a spectacular cliff - top mountain island mansion in the Mediterranean must have seemed a sure fire winner when presented to Universal in 1967 . The result is so absurd and tedious that it almost defies belief . Visually the film is spectacular but that is the force of nature that has allowed the setting and the fact that a real home is used instead of a set . The shrill antics of a screeching Taylor , Burton 's half asleep wanderings , the loony dialog , Noel Coward laughing at himself , the ridiculous story and plot devices and the absurd costuming simply irritate the viewer . BOOM is a disgrace , a waste of money and talent and clear proof that lauded famous people can be idiots just like the rest of the planet 's plebs . Not even fun .

24829,0,"Peter Sellers plays Dick Scratcher ( ha , ha ) , a cook for a pirate ship who takes over as captain after he murders the previous one . Although he 's witnessed a treasure being buried , he begins losing his memory and the treasure map he obtains becomes blank . Thus , Dick is forced to find someone who can see and communicate with ghosts ( do you place an ad for that ? ) and help lead a path to the treasure . It 's mind boggling how anyone could have bankrolled this pointless film . Former Goon Spike Milligan replaced Medak as director , and given Medak 's talents in the film The Ruling Class , you can probably guess which of the grainy , poorly lit scenes had Milligan in the director 's chair . Peter Boyle makes a brief appearance in the film 's first 10 minutes as the doomed pirate captain . He 's probably quite thankful that Young Frankenstein was released the same year this was filmed and canned , so that he can keep this off his resume . Franciosa looks dashing as the handsome power - behind - Scratcher but he and Seller both look pretty desperate , with even Sellers ' makeup and hair looking quite terrible . They had to know this movie was bombing even as they were filming it . With lines like these , I can understand any possible unease : PIERRE : ( about to be hanged ) You 'll pay for this . SCRATCHER : No , I wo n't . I 'll do it for free . And that 's one of the GOOD jokes . It 's amazing to me that much of Sellers prolific material is still in the vaults , but this was made available on VHS more than 15 years ago ! How about someone stepping up to the plate and releasing in the US the well - received British TV program "" A Show Called Fred "" starring Sellers , Milligan , and directed by the great Richard Lester ?",353,0,0.0003921568627451423,0.0003921568627451423,0.0003921568627451423,0.014330280424323204,0.0003921568627451423,0.0003921568627451423,0.0224636212611758,0.0003921568627451423,0.0003921568627451423,0.0003921568627451423,0.0003921568627451423,0.020878771275897608,0.0003921568627451423,0.0003921568627451423,0.0003921568627451423,0.0003921568627451423,0.0003921568627451423,0.0003921568627451423,0.019995714325483107,0.0003921568627451423,0.3482187848277079,0.0003921568627451423,0.0003921568627451423,0.036247949065508246,0.04560466456935812,0.0003921568627451423,0.0003921568627451423,0.0003921568627451423,0.0003921568627451423,0.051204312109001816,0.0003921568627451423,0.0003921568627451423,0.1431731028125854,0.0003921568627451423,0.0003921568627451423,0.0003921568627451423,0.0003921568627451423,0.0003921568627451423,0.0003921568627451423,0.0003921568627451423,0.09595295485343183,0.020052744344609158,0.0003921568627451423,0.16697513934660219,0.0003921568627451423,0.0003921568627451423,0.0003921568627451423,0.0003921568627451423,0.0003921568627451423,0.0003921568627451423,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

However , compared to its contemporaries , it 's a pretty good cartoon and still holds up well . That 's because despite its age , the cartoon is very creative and funny . Felix meets a guy whose shoe business is folding because he ca n't sell any shoes . Well , Felix needs money so he can go to Hollywood , so he tells the guy at the shop he 'll get every shoe sold . Felix spreads chewing gum all over town and soon people are stuck and leave their shoes -- rushing to buy new ones from the shoe store . In gratitude , the guy gives Felix $ 500 !

25124,0,""" A Tale of Two Sisters "" is a brilliant South Korean psychological horror that left me speechless . The film offers some delicious moments of ghastly horror and is extremely creepy . The small cast of actors is truly excellent , with lead I m Soo - jung being especially memorable in the lead role . The direction by Kim Ji - woon is well - handled and the cinematography is absolutely gorgeous . The plot is slightly confusing , but some scenes are wonderfully eerie . The action is rather slow , but I was not bored in the slightest;I was extremely curious and intrigued . The house , where the film takes place looks incredibly menacing and isolated . ""A Tale of Two Sisters "" is along with "" Ringu "" and "" Kairo "" one of the most original Asian horror films I have ever seen . Watch this masterpiece as soon as possible .

25247,0,"I experienced Nightbreed for the first time on television a year ago and i was pleasantly surprised with the results . Clive Barker is said to have revitalised horror with Hellraiser but this is a film that effectively stalled his cinema career somewhat . What an unfortunate thing to happen because , like the inhabitants of Midian , this film seems to be misunderstood . Barker has created a cross - breed of genre staples in this story - it begins as a traditional horror film but soon becomes a fable regarding mans inhumanity to man . Evoking sympathy for the devil is tough at the best of times but when the characters are as visually demonic as they are in this film it becomes nigh on impossible ( cue the child ! ) . The practically Klan - like human insurgence ( pitchforks and holy wrath ! ) at the films conclusion becomes doubly upsetting in the face of what has gone before . As a parable of ethnic tension and white supremacy this film can be quite evocative . I pity those who will not see the film from this angle and think of it as Barker 's fantastical indulgence gone too far . We have a genuine forgotten gem here and the sooner the studio and Mr Barker make nice and devote some time to it - the better .",233,1,0.000571428571428602,0.04900931239695266,0.000571428571428602,0.000571428571428602,0.000571428571428602,0.000571428571428602,0.000571428571428602,0.05172257979942943,0.000571428571428602,0.000571428571428602,0.000571428571428602,0.000571428571428602,0.07974413436876901,0.000571428571428602,0.000571428571428602,0.000571428571428602,0.000571428571428602,0.000571428571428602,0.000571428571428602,0.000571428571428602,0.000571428571428602,0.000571428571428602,0.000571428571428602,0.000571428571428602,0.000571428571428602,0.000571428571428602,0.000571428571428602,0.000571428571428602,0.000571428571428602,0.000571428571428602,0.000571428571428602,0.029166867234420857,0.000571428571428602,0.000571428571428602,0.000571428571428602,0.03404899376476137,0.000571428571428602,0.000571428571428602,0.000571428571428602,0.000571428571428602,0.04278810422365452,0.028654889775325345,0.000571428571428602,0.6608651184366854,0.000571428571428602,0.000571428571428602,0.000571428571428602,0.000571428571428602,0.000571428571428602,0.000571428571428602,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
25297,0,"As with FOOTPRINTS ( 1975 ) , I became aware of this one purely by accident : it was mentioned in a review of THE LIBERTINE ( 1969 ) , which I researched when that film turned up on late - night Italian TV , as being in a similar vein ; incidentally , I missed out on that screening of THE LIBERTINE ( though I acquired it via the same channel later on ) but did manage to watch the film by way of a rental of the English - dubbed R1 DVD during my sojourn in Hollywood in late 2005 / early 2006 . Actually , in view of the enthusiastic reviews for it , I was let down by THE LIBERTINE – being too light - hearted in nature for what was essentially a serious theme ( the sado - masochistic relationship between a young couple ) ! ; to be honest , for much of the time , I was afraid that THE FRIGHTENED WOMAN would go the exact same route … but was subsequently amply redeemed by a wicked ( if not exactly unpredictable ) final twist . The film concerns the freethinking social attitudes and dazzling creative arts prevalent in this era : an eminent philanthropist ( Philippe Leroy ) invites a female journalist ( Dagmar Lassander ) at his fashionable home for the week - end ; however , it transpires that he ’s a misogynist who distrusts all members of the opposite sex and would rather dominate ( or even kill ) them ! Therefore , for the first half of the narrative , we see the heroine enduring pain and humiliation at Leroy ’s hands ( including being forced to make love to a dummy in his own image!) … until the tables are subtly , but unsurprisingly , turned : she not only emancipates herself from his control , but teaches him that Man and Woman can co - exist harmoniously – except that Lassander ’s following her own personal agenda as well ! ! The leads are perfectly cast , and the film itself often darkly comic for those in the mood ; furthermore , it ’s greatly abetted by a typically effervescent “ Euro - Cult ” score ( from the ever - reliable Stelvio Cipriani ) and the imaginative – even outré – look ( the giant structure depicting the lower section of the female form , with a steel - trap where its sexual organ should be , seems to emanate from Freud : incidentally , this prop figured prominently in stills I ’d seen previously from THE FRIGHTENED WOMAN … but it barely registers in the film proper ! ) . Other bizarre touches include the preposterous radio program “ Sexual Aberrations And The Stars ” , and an idyll at a castle belonging to Leroy ’s family complete with secret passage through the wardrobe and a dwarfish manservant . One of the highlights , then , is easily Lassander ’s erotic dance virtually in the nude – an episode which actually spearheads the ‘ humanization ’ of Leroy ; eventually , the two characters have a ‘ showdown ’ in the latter ’s pool – amusingly set to a Spaghetti Western - type theme ! In the long run , for all its stylishness , the film emerges as inferior to the similar but much more extreme contemporaneous Japanese masterpiece by Yasuzo Masumura BLIND BEAST ( 1969 ) . Finally , it ’s worth noting that THE FRIGHTENED WOMAN was distributed in the U.S. by film - maker Radley Metzger ’s company Audubon Films ; he would even employ its production designer ( Enrico Sabbatini ) for his own CAMILLE 2000 ( 1969 ) ! To get to the edition I watched : apart from the usual shortcomings in the English - dubbing department , the presentation here was further marred by a rather washed - out appearance and brief instances of distracting extraneous noise on the soundtrack ! By the way , there seems to be some confusion with respect to the film ’s running - time : its length given on various sources ranges anywhere from 84 to 108 minutes – all I can say , however , is that the copy I own ran for 87 minutes !",727,1,0.00026315789473687067,0.00026315789473687067,0.00026315789473687067,0.0205170349028852,0.00026315789473687067,0.00026315789473687067,0.00026315789473687067,0.0822878275521876,0.00026315789473687067,0.00026315789473687067,0.00026315789473687067,0.00026315789473687067,0.00026315789473687067,0.00026315789473687067,0.03213141643827215,0.00026315789473687067,0.00026315789473687067,0.00026315789473687067,0.02657366439809356,0.00026315789473687067,0.00026315789473687067,0.00026315789473687067,0.00026315789473687067,0.00026315789473687067,0.04362220963651175,0.02783818153942785,0.00026315789473687067,0.00026315789473687067,0.00026315789473687067,0.00026315789473687067,0.00026315789473687067,0.00026315789473687067,0.00026315789473687067,0.00026315789473687067,0.00026315789473687067,0.11942833384815836,0.00026315789473687067,0.03676050517379715,0.00026315789473687067,0.00026315789473687067,0.00026315789473687067,0.00026315789473687067,0.00026315789473687067,0.387529045165353,0.05452192591251615,0.1585266975380595,0.00026315789473687067,0.00026315789473687067,0.00026315789473687067,0.00026315789473687067,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0
25330,0,"This is a fabulous film . The plot is a good yarn , and is imaginatively told in a series of flashbacks and alternative points of view . What was deliberate , and what was coincidence ? Who is in love with who ? You get the chance to put yourselves in the shoes of each of the characters in turn ( sometimes literally ) , and this helps define each character to a satisfying depth . With a bit of effort following the twists and turns , you can understand each of the characters ; and key events in the film are reshot from the point of view of different people . Take the opportunity if it comes again to your arthouse cinema ; it looks good on the big screen . More than keeping you guessing , the plot twists to such an extent that you just sit and watch what unfolds - I defy anyone to predict ! But more likely you will need more than one viewing - I saw this at the pictures on its original release three times , and it got better each time . The acting was very good , with a standout performance by Romane Bohringer as Alice torn in three directions by the three other characters in the ensemble . A classic . The second - best film of the 1990s .",232,1,0.0004651162790698006,0.0004651162790698006,0.0004651162790698006,0.0004651162790698006,0.0004651162790698006,0.0004651162790698006,0.0004651162790698006,0.0004651162790698006,0.0004651162790698006,0.0004651162790698006,0.0004651162790698006,0.0004651162790698006,0.0004651162790698006,0.0004651162790698006,0.0004651162790698006,0.0004651162790698006,0.1368919652061446,0.0004651162790698006,0.0004651162790698006,0.0004651162790698006,0.0004651162790698006,0.0004651162790698006,0.0004651162790698006,0.09096358311800726,0.0004651162790698006,0.0004651162790698006,0.0004651162790698006,0.0004651162790698006,0.0004651162790698006,0.03813460265190072,0.0004651162790698006,0.0004651162790698006,0.0004651162790698006,0.0004651162790698006,0.08051949496035096,0.0004651162790698006,0.0004651162790698006,0.0004651162790698006,0.0004651162790698006,0.0004651162790698006,0.0004651162790698006,0.0004651162790698006,0.0004651162790698006,0.5870553858880164,0.0004651162790698006,0.04596985189650865,0.0004651162790698006,0.0004651162790698006,0.0004651162790698006,0.0004651162790698006,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0
25410,0,"As most other reviewers seem to agree , this adaptation of ' After The Funeral ' is very good indeed . Always one of my favourite Poirot stories I was worried that it might be ' messed about with ' . Well , it was a little bit but ONLY a little bit and the end the result was thoroughly entertaining . David Suchet continues to be well nigh faultless as Poirot and ( as others have pointed out ) the other star of this show is Monica Dolan who surely could not be bettered as Miss Gilchrist . I also really enjoyed Fiona Glasscott who was spot on as the cutting Rosamund Shane but really , the casting was quite impeccable throughout ! One point is knocked off for the adaptors not being able to resist cramming too many revelations into the final fifteen minutes . The business with the will and house deeds was all a bit unnecessary although I did n't mind how they tightened up the structure of the Abernethie family ( in the book the family tree IS really quite complicated ) . The final moments when the murderer is revealed however are really incredibly well done and I found the very end , when they all leave Enderby , quite touching . This is really one of the very best of the Poirot series so far .",233,1,0.0005128205128205545,0.0005128205128205545,0.0005128205128205545,0.0005128205128205545,0.0005128205128205545,0.0005128205128205545,0.0005128205128205545,0.0005128205128205545,0.0005128205128205545,0.0005128205128205545,0.0005128205128205545,0.0005128205128205545,0.0005128205128205545,0.0005128205128205545,0.0005128205128205545,0.0005128205128205545,0.0005128205128205545,0.0005128205128205545,0.02614778181423488,0.03146361750541907,0.0005128205128205545,0.34724351256937314,0.0005128205128205545,0.027297624439685725,0.0005128205128205545,0.0005128205128205545,0.04492941351442507,0.0005128205128205545,0.0005128205128205545,0.0005128205128205545,0.0005128205128205545,0.0005128205128205545,0.04484513086160153,0.0005128205128205545,0.1812842114898091,0.0005128205128205545,0.04346805302088206,0.0005128205128205545,0.0005128205128205545,0.0005128205128205545,0.0005128205128205545,0.0005128205128205545,0.0005128205128205545,0.2322950137589267,0.0005128205128205545,0.0005128205128205545,0.0005128205128205545,0.0005128205128205545,0.0005128205128205545,0.0005128205128205545,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
25470,0,"Wow , I 've sure seen quite a bit of Kelli McCarty this summer . I did n't know this woman made so many softcore flicks in the past three years . It 's like seeing a future softcore star blossom in front of me , much like Michelle Hall did a couple of years ago . ""Passion 's Peak "" is the third quality softcore flick I 've seen Kelli McCarty in , with "" Girl for Girl "" and "" House of Love "" being the others . "" Desire and Deception "" was okay , but it was n't spectacular . There 's spoilers in this review , so read only if you want to . The story begins with Christina ( Kelli McCarty ) heading out of the big city and to the mountains . She has inherited a house from her dear departed grandmother and plans to turn it into a mountain lodge . Before she can even set her things down , some woman named Kim ( uncredited in this film , but quite the aggressive one ) begins booking guests to stay there . Now she has to get the house into shape quickly -- in comes Chip ( Bobby Johnston ) , a childhood friend , to the rescue . Chip helps her get the house in workable condition . She hires two local slackers to work in her lodge -- Chip 's sister Bait ( Samantha McConnell ) and her sex buddy Hank . Now the guests start coming . The first to arrive are Eric and Linda ( Flower ) , two stereotypical money - first lawyers . Linda and Eric get into a huge argument during a dinner party halfway through the film which leads to their breakup ; sad stuff there . Next , there 's romance novelist Sophia , played by B - movie goddess Monique Parent . She 's using that silly alias Scarlet Johansing again , and she 's got a very professional look this time -- with blonde hair , of course . It would n't be Monique if she did n't have at least one scene where she plays with herself -- and she obliges , during one of Eric and Linda 's sex scenes . James and Shene ( Devinn Lane -- yes , the porn star Devinn Lane ) show up for a little weekend getaway as well . Unbeknownst to Shene , James and Christina have quite a history . James and Christina used to date , but Christina broke it off to head to this mountain lodge . James comes up to the lodge to get Christina back , but his plan backfires . Christina spills the beans to Shene , which causes Shene to walk out on him and down to the local bar to strip for the locals . Shene ends up in the sleeping bag of the now - single Eric , and they leave together . Bait realizes she wants something more than just sex with Hank , and Christine finds true love with Chip , with Sophia soaking it all in and writing it into her next romance novel . In fact .... if you ask me , this whole movie played out like a romance novel . I do n't know if the screenwriter was going for that effect , but I sure got that impression . Sophia had some of the best lines in this film , playing up the idea that this is a live - action romance novel . She seems to enjoy all the fighting and backstabbing going on . Now to the sex . There was a fair amount of it , and it was the usual bump - and grind stuff . Monique did her fair share of moaning in her two sex scenes . This film was tapeworthy , and the story will actually keep the audience somewhat interested in between the sex scenes . Women : A- ( Monique was simply Monique . Out of all the softcore actresses I 've seen over the years , she 's the best at acting , in my opinion . She can really act and be sexy , which is why she 's holding on to the # 1 position in my Skinemax Top 10 . Kelli McCarty is better at doing softcore films than she is on the soap opera "" Passions "" ; I do n't know why she 's not doing more of these . Flower was merely background scenery for the most part in a limited role . Samantha McConnell continues to impress me , and Devinn Lane is yet another hardcore actress crossing over into the softcore realm and doing a halfway decent job at it.)Sex : B ( It was good , but not awe - inspiring spectacular . Plenty of moaning . Do n't watch the R - rated version , trust me .... most of the good stuff is taken out . My grade is for the uncut version.)Story : B ( A solid storyline which throws in a contrived "" Ooh , the building inspector 's gon na shut us down "" subplot toward the end which messes up things . The underlying story between Christina and James was nice , and Sophia 's dialogue , full of the metaphors and imagery usually found in romance novels , was a nice touch.)Overall : B+ ( I found this movie to be quite entertaining . It 's not a surefire Softcore Hall - Of - Famer like "" Girl for Girl "" is , but it 's a respectable addition to the Skinemax collection . )",956,1,0.00013071895424837936,0.04926213456099197,0.00843033286144566,0.00013071895424837936,0.00013071895424837936,0.00013071895424837936,0.00013071895424837936,0.00013071895424837936,0.01957802318787564,0.00013071895424837936,0.00013071895424837936,0.00013071895424837936,0.00013071895424837936,0.00013071895424837936,0.00013071895424837936,0.00013071895424837936,0.00013071895424837936,0.00013071895424837936,0.00013071895424837936,0.042874802812127674,0.39488265955171536,0.13440095812034014,0.00013071895424837936,0.00013071895424837936,0.00013071895424837936,0.017129116491670156,0.00013071895424837936,0.00013071895424837936,0.00013071895424837936,0.00013071895424837936,0.00013071895424837936,0.006535867269935691,0.00013071895424837936,0.00013071895424837936,0.00013071895424837936,0.04678118182252205,0.04496885466203631,0.00013071895424837936,0.00013071895424837936,0.00013071895424837936,0.06348911999130061,0.00013071895424837936,0.00013071895424837936,0.07894852394481155,0.07820189195432543,0.00013071895424837936,0.009810650415959831,0.00013071895424837936,0.00013071895424837936,0.00013071895424837936,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0

25485,0,"I first saw this movie when I was about 12 years old . It has been one of my favorites since ... It 's so perfect in all it 's glory complete with awesome soundtrack , cheesy dialog , and it was both hilarious and terribly sad . The first movie I really just had a fit about at the end ... I wo n't ruin it for you guys but boy is it a tear jerker ... I just remember feeling SO sad for Gary ! What a bunch of cool characters in this movie it 's genius ! ! ! They are all so great even the nerdy girl Gary does n't like ... (she had a nice little body though ) . I ca n't believe all the girls go for Rick he is such a sleaze ball with his handkerchief tied around his neck ! ! ! ha ha ha ... When watching this movie be prepared for lots of sex jokes complete with sexually transmitted diseases(almost ) . But a love story at heart with real problems , dealing from insecurity to life altering decisions that make you think and feel genuine sorrow for the cast . I love this movie ! ! !

25520,0,"I do n't know whether this film hits my heart the way it does because of the feelings of friendship , love , closeness to others or the warmth of that transformation Babette 's cooking creates , but when the feast starts and for the rest of the movie , I choke up often . Yes , this is a feel - good movie , but without a speck of mawkishness or facile sentimentality . Please note that elements of the plot are discussed . Babette 's Feast tells its story with restraint and care , and it lets us discover for ourselves the values of grace and love . All we need to know is that Babette Harsant ( Stephane Audran ) was a French refugee who was given shelter by two aging sisters in a tiny community on the coast of Jutland . The sisters lead what remains of their father 's flock . He was a pastor of conviction who taught that salvation comes through self - denial . The sisters made their sacrifices to duty and faith . Those who still remain honor the now long dead pastor 's teachings and his spiritual guidance . Still , as they have grown older the tiny community has become querulous and argumentative . The sisters do what they can . For the pastor 's 100th birthday , Babette wishes to cook the dinner for the small group the sisters will invite . The sisters reluctantly agree , but when they see the supplies Babette has ordered , they and their guests become uneasy . They are used to the community 's usual fare of dried cod , boiled , and a soup made of bread , water and a little ale . Even though Babette over time has made improvements , what they are seeing now seems close to godlessness . At the dinner also will be a visitor , General Lorens Lowenhielm , who years earlier had chosen ambition over his love for one of the sisters . What do we experience ? There is the austerity of the aging community 's faith and the stone , wind - swept cottages they live in . There is the warmth by candlelight of the sisters ' small , crowded dining room . And then there is the transforming power of Babette 's artistry as we watch her cook , watch Erik , a young boy helping her , serve and pour , and watch the old parishioners , with the help of fine wine and exquisite cooking , gradually rediscover their community and love and friendship . The General serves as our unexpected guide because he is the only one who knows what extraordinary dishes they are eating . The General tells a story to his uncomprehending dinner companions , a story about a famed woman who was the exemplary chef at the famed Café Anglais in Paris . "" ... this woman , this head chef , had the ability to transform a dinner into a kind of love affair ... a love affair that made no distinction between bodily appetite and spiritual appetite . "" He , too , is being transformed into a man who will accept what he has become and yet will always know the value and the love of what long ago he chose not to accept . An old couple kiss . Two old men remember past friendships . And Babette , who spent all that she had won in a lottery on this dinner , has had an opportunity to be the artist she once was in France , an opportunity she accepted with love and friendship . Babette , now as poor as she was when she arrived penniless years earlier , will continue with the sisters . The general in a carriage with his aunt returns to her estate . And the elderly guests leave the sisters ' home to return to their own cottages . They pause and look at the clear night sky and the stars overhead . They spontaneously hold hands in a circle and dance and sing this hymn ... "" The clock strikes and time goes by Eternity is nigh . Let us use this time to try To serve the Lord with heart and mind .

25588,0,"This BBC version of an Agatha Christie book shows the pitfalls of following a book too closely . Christie 's books tend to move at a gentle , sometimes even sedate pace , and "" Evans "" is one that certainly does . It also has a solid school of red herrings to confuse the plot . This version is extremely faithful to the book , which results in a very slow , involved story . As a Christie fan , I gave it 7 stars , but it takes 3 hours to make its way through a relatively action - free story . I appreciate some of the tightening of plots that the BBC did for its later Christie productions much more . In the end , this movie is a leisurely pleasure , highlighted by the breathy waif Francesca Annis who brings considerable charisma to her role and plays off James Warwick very well .",157,1,0.0006451612903226171,0.0006451612903226171,0.0006451612903226171,0.03507500044944754,0.0006451612903226171,0.0006451612903226171,0.0006451612903226171,0.0006451612903226171,0.1287872111553022,0.0006451612903226171,0.0006451612903226171,0.0006451612903226171,0.0006451612903226171,0.0006451612903226171,0.0006451612903226171,0.0006451612903226171,0.0006451612903226171,0.0006451612903226171,0.0006451612903226171,0.0006451612903226171,0.0006451612903226171,0.21062825221917197,0.0006451612903226171,0.03368368552690369,0.07739973057927615,0.03292395402670347,0.14815204868127185,0.0006451612903226171,0.0006451612903226171,0.0006451612903226171,0.0006451612903226171,0.0006451612903226171,0.0006451612903226171,0.0006451612903226171,0.0006451612903226171,0.0006451612903226171,0.3062533431683734,0.0006451612903226171,0.0006451612903226171,0.0006451612903226171,0.0006451612903226171,0.0006451612903226171,0.0006451612903226171,0.0006451612903226171,0.0006451612903226171,0.0006451612903226171,0.0006451612903226171,0.0006451612903226171,0.0006451612903226171,0.0006451612903226171,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
25670,0,"When I first heard of this movie , I was mildly interested . The plot seemed like an opportunity for hilarity and Bam Margera as an actor and director seemed like something that might be good . When I found out the movie starred Ryan Dunn , I was even further interested ( I was a fan of Homewrecker when it was on ... Yeah , I 'm that lame ) . However , I did n't have much faith in it being to good . When I sat down to watch it , I was afraid I was wasting my time . But even just five minutes it it became apparent that I 'd been wrong . I thought that the comedy of this film was delightfully idiotic , and definitely not suited for all kinds of people . The acting was rather good , much better than my expectations . I thought that it was rather easy to relate to Ryan 's character , which gave the movie a center that was believable . This is key in a movie as outrageous as this ( and is probably why I was not a fan of Borat).The movie is not suitable at all for younger people , DUH , and will definitely create more than it 's fair share of awkward turtles if watched with parents . But it 's a good one for you and your buddies on a movie night .",244,1,0.0004878048780488071,0.0004878048780488071,0.0004878048780488071,0.0004878048780488071,0.0004878048780488071,0.0004878048780488071,0.0004878048780488071,0.0004878048780488071,0.0004878048780488071,0.0004878048780488071,0.0004878048780488071,0.0004878048780488071,0.0004878048780488071,0.0004878048780488071,0.0004878048780488071,0.0004878048780488071,0.0004878048780488071,0.0004878048780488071,0.02487395369498887,0.04908204600903644,0.5122798668321243,0.3544183083559813,0.0004878048780488071,0.037394605595672606,0.0004878048780488071,0.0004878048780488071,0.0004878048780488071,0.0004878048780488071,0.0004878048780488071,0.0004878048780488071,0.0004878048780488071,0.0004878048780488071,0.0004878048780488071,0.0004878048780488071,0.0004878048780488071,0.0004878048780488071,0.0004878048780488071,0.0004878048780488071,0.0004878048780488071,0.0004878048780488071,0.0004878048780488071,0.0004878048780488071,0.0004878048780488071,0.0004878048780488071,0.0004878048780488071,0.0004878048780488071,0.0004878048780488071,0.0004878048780488071,0.0004878048780488071,0.0004878048780488071,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
25680,0,"I saw Marigold at a preview showing a few days ago , and found it to be a thoroughly engrossing and enjoyable film . The film is about a not - so - successful American actress who goes to India to act in a low budget film , only to find herself stranded there when she finds on arrival that the film 's financing has vanished , along with the producers and investors . A chance encounter with an Indian film shooting nearby leads her to be hired for a small dancer role in that . Since Indian films incorporate a significant amount of singing and dancing , this is a problem for Marigold , who has two left feet , not to mention a personality so tightly wound - up and thorny that she can hardly hear the music , let alone feel it , as Prem , the choreographer of the film , advices her to do . But "" prem "" -- the word , not the person -- means "" love "" , and Prem -- the person , not the word -- seems to embody that emotion in the way he deals with all around him , whether it be his production assistant friends who introduced Marigold to the shoot , the narcissistic and arrogant leads of the film , or the bitchy and uptight Marigold herself . Soon , under his expert tutelage and endearing treatment , Marigold finds her feet -- literally and figuratively . I must say a word for those not familiar with the use of song and dance in Indian films . Unlike American musicals , the story progresses through these dance numbers , as plot developments unfold , and character transformations occur in parallel with the dancing . It should also be pointed out that Indian dance is about a lot more than mere movement . An essential part of it is the enactment of the dancer 's feelings and emotions while telling the story of the dance . This is the main purpose of the dance and the dancer . That Marigold reaches this stage of accomplishment is demonstrated in a stunning dance number about midway through , when Marigold , while performing the dance she is required to do for the film - within - the - film , also expresses her love for Prem . It is an amazing performance by Ali Larter , especially when one considers that she is not used to dancing in her films , or emoting her character 's feelings via dance . It shows her skill as an actress , as well as how much hard work she has put into the role . Of course no romantic film can work without a credible Prince Charming . Salman Khan , who plays the role of Prem , fits the role to a T. Even when it turns out that he is a Prince not so charming , he does not lose the audience 's sympathy . Salman has been ruling Hindi cinema ( sometimes called Bollywood ) for many years now , and it is worth remembering that his first leading role was also as Prem . He is completely charming , sweet , adorable , sexy , and vulnerable . For those who have never encountered him on screen before , be prepared to be hit with mega doses of sheer magnetism ! He and Ali Larter make a lovely pair , and are as well matched in their acting as in their appearance . Will they manage to work out their problems ? It does n't seem possible as we hear the last song of the film , a lovely blending of fact and fantasy , reality and metaphor . The ending certainly took some of the audience I saw it with by surprise , but they were left satisfied . The songs are used very cleverly . They are in Hindi , unsubtitled , for the film - within - the - film sequences , and in English for other occasions . But their meaning is always clear from the context and choreography . Marigold is a very satisfying romantic comedy -- yes , there is quite a bit of humor as well in it . The Indian locations and costumes give it a fairy tale quality , befitting a story which can be likened to a modern fairy tale . If you are or have been curious about Indian cinema , but were hesitant to try it , this is an excellent introduction . It captures the color and vibrancy of Indian films , not only in the costumes and jewelry ( which are quite impressive ) , but also in the lively dances and world sound music . If you are a fan of Ali Larter , you should watch it for her excellent acting in portraying a selfish , demanding , "" high - maintanance "" woman who nevertheless has an inner attraction that inspires the love of two men . If you are a girl , you will enjoy admiring Ali 's lovely costumes and ogling her hunk of a leading man . If you are a guy , you can not only admire Ali in her sexy costumes , but learn from Salman Khan what it takes to bring out the loving heart even from someone as edgy as Marigold .",909,1,0.06455060428916871,0.00016260162601628117,0.01647698201993927,0.00016260162601628117,0.00016260162601628117,0.00016260162601628117,0.008526598993244892,0.09450483577399786,0.03500781218413261,0.00016260162601628117,0.00016260162601628117,0.00016260162601628117,0.00016260162601628117,0.00016260162601628117,0.00016260162601628117,0.00016260162601628117,0.00016260162601628117,0.00016260162601628117,0.00016260162601628117,0.00016260162601628117,0.16498863607733807,0.00016260162601628117,0.00016260162601628117,0.00016260162601628117,0.025652565102262485,0.03669594409641142,0.00016260162601628117,0.00016260162601628117,0.025919090736748873,0.00016260162601628117,0.00016260162601628117,0.01804175678510589,0.00016260162601628117,0.00016260162601628117,0.00016260162601628117,0.00016260162601628117,0.00016260162601628117,0.008292682917804866,0.02748351347298933,0.00016260162601628117,0.025211577676557708,0.00016260162601628117,0.00016260162601628117,0.4224341406184911,0.00016260162601628117,0.00016260162601628117,0.020522202345237026,0.00016260162601628117,0.00016260162601628117,0.00016260162601628117,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0

26084,0,"Manna From Heaven is a light comedy that uses exaggeration of human foibles to entertain the audience . Throughout the film there is the expectation that goodness will surface in each situation . The result is that the movie goer finds himself / herself sitting with this silly grin on his / her face , peace in his / her heart , and high expectations for human kind .

26211,0,"OK . A warning for anyone out there who is a parent or guardian . Be careful about who you see this film with - ie - DO NOT TAKE KIDS TO SEE THIS FILM . I 'll explain why.1 - the title is misleading and the film has nothing to do with romance - I assume this was fully intentional on the producers behalf , but is annoying 2 - the film itself is really very very disturbing . I have some problems - first is the fact that the film is neither violent or sexual and therefore is not a ' horror film ' . But it IS a very disturbing film , and involves a child and his parents , and a small town . OK , it boils down to this . The film is not suitable for minors , because it contains sequences and images that are unsettling and would be confusing to a child . Is has a bizarre quality to it , and its ONLY because it has a child in it that makes me feel its unsuitable . As a parent myself I feel strongly enough to want to tell people because I read only the other day that it is having a release in theatres . I hope i m not offending the film makers by saying this , but I think its my right , because its getting a release , and has an M rating only.(because its not violent or sexual ) . Just weird and unsettling but pretty good in and of itself .",266,1,0.00048780487804881567,0.00048780487804881567,0.027892598243504728,0.00048780487804881567,0.00048780487804881567,0.042248747731069146,0.00048780487804881567,0.00048780487804881567,0.00048780487804881567,0.00048780487804881567,0.00048780487804881567,0.00048780487804881567,0.20209746642379559,0.00048780487804881567,0.00048780487804881567,0.00048780487804881567,0.12187881271370966,0.00048780487804881567,0.00048780487804881567,0.00048780487804881567,0.00048780487804881567,0.00048780487804881567,0.00048780487804881567,0.00048780487804881567,0.028686112832047538,0.00048780487804881567,0.00048780487804881567,0.00048780487804881567,0.00048780487804881567,0.00048780487804881567,0.00048780487804881567,0.00048780487804881567,0.00048780487804881567,0.00048780487804881567,0.00048780487804881567,0.00048780487804881567,0.00048780487804881567,0.00048780487804881567,0.07105163008330144,0.00048780487804881567,0.00048780487804881567,0.0736064052745149,0.028478780148663674,0.3840594465493919,0.00048780487804881567,0.00048780487804881567,0.00048780487804881567,0.00048780487804881567,0.00048780487804881567,0.00048780487804881567,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
26305,0,"Lucasarts have pulled yet another beauty out of a seemingly bottomless bag of great games . If any further proof was required that they rule this genre of gaming , then this is it . Before actually playing the game , there was a little concern about how the writers were going to keep up the pace of gags after the first two games . Fears were rife that it was going to wear a bit thin . Play the game and see how quickly those fears are allayed . From the introductory video with Guybrush in the dodgem boat ( ! ) , to the closing stages in the funfair , the jokes just keep on coming . I was a great fan of the first two games and the other Lucasarts works ( Day Of The Tentacle , Sam & Max , etc ) and this one does not fail to deliver the quality . You will not be disappointed .

26681,0,"Reading the other comments here at the IMDB , I had very high expectations before seeing ' Angels of the universe ' . I was n't disappointed , and giving the movie an 8 , I would say that I can justify that grade . The movie has some incredible acting , especially by the main - person , Pall . The supporting actors are also doing a very good job like the patients in the mental institution , the parents and the siblings of Pall . The music is also worth mentioning , supporting the movie throughout , giving depth and feeling . Although the movie is very scandinavian , it does n't leave out some humour and has a sort of objective authorship about Pall 's life . Still , if you want to see a cheesy comedy or something light - weight , this is not for you . It is a story about people with mental problems , about the way they are being dealt with in society - but most of all , a story about Pall . I recommend this movie to all movie connoisseurs . It is one of the best movies that has ever come out of Iceland , if not out of Scandinavia .",213,1,0.0005000000000000428,0.0005000000000000428,0.0005000000000000428,0.0005000000000000428,0.0005000000000000428,0.0005000000000000428,0.0005000000000000428,0.0005000000000000428,0.049016873597195657,0.0005000000000000428,0.0005000000000000428,0.021185599838155947,0.0005000000000000428,0.0005000000000000428,0.0005000000000000428,0.0005000000000000428,0.06288208042786561,0.0005000000000000428,0.0005000000000000428,0.0005000000000000428,0.5953177064178858,0.0005000000000000428,0.0005000000000000428,0.0005000000000000428,0.0005000000000000428,0.0005000000000000428,0.0005000000000000428,0.0005000000000000428,0.0005000000000000428,0.0005000000000000428,0.0005000000000000428,0.0005000000000000428,0.0005000000000000428,0.0005000000000000428,0.15810677233018997,0.0005000000000000428,0.06365609541119942,0.0005000000000000428,0.0005000000000000428,0.0005000000000000428,0.0005000000000000428,0.0005000000000000428,0.02833487197750571,0.0005000000000000428,0.0005000000000000428,0.0005000000000000428,0.0005000000000000428,0.0005000000000000428,0.0005000000000000428,0.0005000000000000428,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
26697,0,"I must admit this is one of Cameron Diaz 's unheard of films and i was also surprised that she had an important role but she was not the lead . I was very touched by it as i really can identify the pain of the loss of a loved one as i have experienced it from close quarters . Both Camilla Belle and Jordana Brewster were really good in their portrayal of the protagonist Phoebe and i must also hand it to the casting people for finding two actresses who look so alike that i really thought they were sisters(in real life ) . This is one of those movies Cameron did for the sake of acting and not for star billing . She looked the part of the gorgeous , rebellious hippie who wants to change the world though sometimes she comes off as a rebel without a cause . Coming from a dysfunctional family where her only source of strength being her big sister Faith , little girl Phoebe is understandably very upset when faith leaves for Europe . As she grows up she goes off in search of her sister and gradually gets disillusioned by the truth about her sister and falls for her sister 's boyfriend .

26842,0,"I read the book before seeing the movie , and the film is one of the best adaptations out there . Very true and faithful to the book . Sean Penn and Sarandon are amazing . Robbins is a talented filmaker and I wish he would add more to his repetoire . He made the film very haunting and intentionally slow - paced to add depth . An especially brilliant bit of filmaking was the reflection of the victims appearing in the glass of the execution room at the very end .",92,1,0.0010526315789474421,0.2503992570195227,0.0010526315789474421,0.0010526315789474421,0.0010526315789474421,0.0010526315789474421,0.053684210526317465,0.0010526315789474421,0.0010526315789474421,0.0010526315789474421,0.0010526315789474421,0.0010526315789474421,0.0010526315789474421,0.0010526315789474421,0.0010526315789474421,0.0010526315789474421,0.0010526315789474421,0.0010526315789474421,0.0010526315789474421,0.0010526315789474421,0.08107771654937447,0.0010526315789474421,0.0010526315789474421,0.0010526315789474421,0.0010526315789474421,0.0010526315789474421,0.0010526315789474421,0.0010526315789474421,0.0010526315789474421,0.0010526315789474421,0.0010526315789474421,0.0010526315789474421,0.0010526315789474421,0.0010526315789474421,0.0010526315789474421,0.0010526315789474421,0.20455474513315974,0.0010526315789474421,0.0010526315789474421,0.12409167254045028,0.0010526315789474421,0.0010526315789474421,0.0010526315789474421,0.2398766087574881,0.0010526315789474421,0.0010526315789474421,0.0010526315789474421,0.0010526315789474421,0.0010526315789474421,0.0010526315789474421,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1
26849,0,""" Dead Man Walking "" is one of the most powerful movies I have ever seen . I find it hard to believe that anyone , after having seen the movie , could feel indifferent about the film or its message . Tim Robbins does not try to impose his ideas and beliefs on the viewers , but manages to make a film that are in most ways sympathetic to both views on the death penalty -- whether it is right to murder a murderer or not . I have always known where I stand in this question , even as a child , and this movie -- despite the fact that it does not really take any sides -- made me even surer in my conviction that it can never be right to murder * anyone*.Sean Penn is absolutely brilliant in his portrayal of Matthew Poncelet , his nomination for an Academy Award was very well - deserved . Even if Nicolas Cage does a great job in "" Leaving Las Vegas "" , I would have been happier if Penn had won the award . Susan Sarandon is also brilliant and she deserved the Academy Award she won . And Tim Robbins certainly deserves the vote I have given this film : 9/10 !",216,1,0.0005714285714286127,0.0005714285714286127,0.0005714285714286127,0.07570826520645782,0.022244173021731595,0.0005714285714286127,0.0005714285714286127,0.187789692111013,0.0005714285714286127,0.0005714285714286127,0.0005714285714286127,0.0005714285714286127,0.0005714285714286127,0.0005714285714286127,0.0005714285714286127,0.0005714285714286127,0.20762423911135763,0.0005714285714286127,0.0005714285714286127,0.0005714285714286127,0.24684053841494644,0.0005714285714286127,0.0005714285714286127,0.0005714285714286127,0.0005714285714286127,0.0005714285714286127,0.0005714285714286127,0.0005714285714286127,0.0005714285714286127,0.0005714285714286127,0.0005714285714286127,0.0005714285714286127,0.0005714285714286127,0.0005714285714286127,0.0005714285714286127,0.0005714285714286127,0.0005714285714286127,0.0005714285714286127,0.0005714285714286127,0.0005714285714286127,0.0005714285714286127,0.034328634610222564,0.0005714285714286127,0.2008930289528405,0.0005714285714286127,0.0005714285714286127,0.0005714285714286127,0.0005714285714286127,0.0005714285714286127,0.0005714285714286127,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
26901,0,Sharky 's Machine is a crime drama set in early 80 's Atlanta . It stars Burt Reynolds as a renegade cop who is hellbent on stopping crime and corruption in his city . The story is about a dirty politician who is at the top of a crime ring that has been brining the city to it 's knees . Sharky 's link to bringing down this syndicate is a high - priced hooker that he falls for during the course of the movie . The action sequences are well done for the early 80 's and the soundtrack / score are pretty good . The acting is B - level but this is a pretty decent film to have in your DVD collection .

26992,0,"ALICE is the kind of movie they made in the 30 's and 40 's . Never attempts to be an "" event "" . Just wants to entertain . And it does . I was surprised by Kiefer Sutherland . In a role that could be a cliche , he made it real . The plot does make allusions to ALICE IN WONDERLAND . A guy dressed in white does go through a hole and Kiefer does fall down one . Like ALICE the plot does twist and turn , but with a freshness you do n't see in small movies .

27139,0,"Quick summary of the book : Boy , Billy Tepper , about 12 years old is school 's main trouble maker , and if he gets kicked out of one more school he 'll be sent off to boarding school . His upscale boy 's school in Switzerland ( or somewhere like it ) gets taken over by Arab terrorists , why I 'm not really sure . Billy has no friends , and likes to use his laptop to hack into his school 's database . He , with the help of two teachers thwarts the terrorists ' plans , and save the entire school . The book was n't bad , but was sooooooo cliché . Now about the movie ; they switched Arab terrorists to Cuban terrorists , and make Billy about 17 and the leader of his group of friends . They like to get into trouble , but normal teenage stuff . This movie was believable . Maybe not realistic , but the characters are real . You can watch Billy , Joey , and the rest of the guys and see real kids acting out the way they did ( or at least wanting to).Great action scenes . Not everything goes as planned for either side . Overthrowing the terrorists was messy , and good guys did get hurt . I wo n't say who , but it is heart wrenching ( I know , I use that word a lot ) . Sean Astin is excellent . As a teenager he usually played the dopey best friend . This movie proved once again that he could play the leading man , kid , whatever . The only performance that may have upstaged his was Wil Wheaton 's , who played the only son of a New Jersey mafia man . He hated his father , and everything he stood for . ( A far cry from Wesley Crusher ) Usually this genre of film is one I watch for the soul purpose of making fun ; but not Toy Soldiers . The story line flows , the dialogue is usually believable . I ca n't think of a single moment where I found myself shouting at the TV "" Oh that would so not happen "" Great movie that should be in everyone 's collection .",393,1,0.000222222222222243,0.000222222222222243,0.000222222222222243,0.000222222222222243,0.000222222222222243,0.012038154805899853,0.000222222222222243,0.000222222222222243,0.000222222222222243,0.000222222222222243,0.000222222222222243,0.000222222222222243,0.000222222222222243,0.000222222222222243,0.000222222222222243,0.000222222222222243,0.000222222222222243,0.000222222222222243,0.000222222222222243,0.000222222222222243,0.7755067414615495,0.000222222222222243,0.000222222222222243,0.000222222222222243,0.000222222222222243,0.05661140906919692,0.000222222222222243,0.000222222222222243,0.000222222222222243,0.000222222222222243,0.000222222222222243,0.000222222222222243,0.019331719879430758,0.000222222222222243,0.000222222222222243,0.012336645954552741,0.03396005554600407,0.000222222222222243,0.013882693663579188,0.000222222222222243,0.01584380130925022,0.025639022687589764,0.000222222222222243,0.000222222222222243,0.000222222222222243,0.000222222222222243,0.025960866734057366,0.000222222222222243,0.000222222222222243,0.000222222222222243,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

27436,0,"Despite the pans of reviewers , I liked this movie . In fact , I liked it better than Interview With a Vampire and I liked this Lestat ( Stuart Townsend ) better than Cruise 's attempt . All the major players from the series were present : Talbot , Lestat , Armand , Maharet , Khayman , Pandora , Mael , Marius and a half - dozen more ( albeit most of them in cameo ) . Marius , Lestat and Akasha were the main players ( and Jesse of the Talamasca ) . Also , despite other reviews , I think this movie and the music was faithful to Anne Rice 's portrayal and ethos , at least as I perceive it . Aailiyah was pretty good as Akasha , in places compelling ( her first entrance and mini dance scene ) . The movie did n't capture the breadth of the books series but I thought it was a nice supplement . I'm a big fan of this series mostly due to Anne Rice 's style , sensitivities and treatments .

27627,0,"Victor Sjöström was quite the master in this film , having starred in it , directed it and even wrote the screenplay ! That 's pretty amazing . While today few have any idea who Sjöström was , he might be familiar to Ingmar Bergman fans as the star one of Bergman 's most acclaimed films , WILD STRAWBERRIES.As far as this film goes , it 's a very mixed bag . On one hand , you have to respect it because for 1921 , it 's a very good film . The idea of the Grim Reaper sitting down with a dead man to discuss his wasted life is pretty imaginative . Plus , the special effect of the Phantom Carriage is pretty convincing and technically speaking this is a well - crafted film . On the other hand , it 's an amazingly dated and preachy film -- more like something you 'd expect to be shown in Sunday School instead of in an honest to goodness theater . Plus , some of the story elements just do n't make sense . Instead of coming off as dedicated or good , the dying Salvation Army worker seems like a sap -- a very sad and confusing sap . Why is she "" in love "" with this man ? Am I missing something?So , my recommendation is that if you are insanely in love with silents ( like me ) , then by all means watch it . But , if you are n't a silent fan , this film might do nothing to convince you that this style film is brilliant because the story is so overly melodramatic and dated .",284,1,0.00038461538461540966,0.00038461538461540966,0.00038461538461540966,0.00038461538461540966,0.00038461538461540966,0.00038461538461540966,0.03884615417317898,0.10216973665562978,0.00038461538461540966,0.00038461538461540966,0.00038461538461540966,0.00038461538461540966,0.00038461538461540966,0.00038461538461540966,0.00038461538461540966,0.00038461538461540966,0.10939411019692655,0.00038461538461540966,0.00038461538461540966,0.00038461538461540966,0.00038461538461540966,0.14240463319589877,0.00038461538461540966,0.032919527053414055,0.00038461538461540966,0.06096158718518496,0.00038461538461540966,0.00038461538461540966,0.00038461538461540966,0.00038461538461540966,0.00038461538461540966,0.00038461538461540966,0.12520982020320162,0.00038461538461540966,0.00038461538461540966,0.00038461538461540966,0.00038461538461540966,0.00038461538461540966,0.00038461538461540966,0.00038461538461540966,0.00038461538461540966,0.00038461538461540966,0.00038461538461540966,0.37194058518271805,0.00038461538461540966,0.00038461538461540966,0.00038461538461540966,0.00038461538461540966,0.00038461538461540966,0.00038461538461540966,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
27731,0,"Before I review this film , I must make a confession that is rather a bold statement to make as a film reviewer . Anyone who has already read any of my previous reviews may know that I 've always been controversial in a low - key sense , giving high marks for flops such as "" Captain America "" and 1985 's "" Creature "" and panning such film classics as Alistar Sim 's "" A Christmas Carol "" and "" Shakespeare in Love . "" With that in mind , this confession might not come as a surprise : The simple fact is , Christopher Lambert is probably one of my favorite actors . Woah , now , do n't start getting crazy on me just yet . Let me explain myself : I by no means think he 's the greatest actor in the world . I clearly confess that he is not . He is certainly no Morgan Freeman or Anthony Hopkins , but I would say that his acting ability is probably somewhere up there with at least Bruce Willis . What I admire about him , however , are the human qualities that he brings into his action heroes . He is just an average guy who laughs and cries and bleeds , who is a hero because he has to be , not necessarily because he wants to be . It takes a lot , in my opinion , to be able to bring out those qualities in a character ( especially in the movies he 's worked in ) , and Lambert 's heroes are a far cry from Schwartzennegger 's or Stallone 's . Quite frankly , Lambert 's characters are easier for me to relate to . Hence , he 's not the greatest actor in the world .... He 's just a personal favorite . I ca n't say that same , however , for his films . However much I appretiate his acting , it would be foolish not to confess that his choice of films leave something to be desired . Most of them are , quite frankly , terrible , and any ridicule that he 's gotten over the years from me is n't due to his acting , but rather his bad choice in scripts . With that in mind , I can say that his debut film , "" Tarzan , "" is one of his best films and probably his greatest performance . As I mentioned , it is effective becasue of the humaness he brings to the role , and for how seriously the director , writers and actors handle the material . This is a far leap from the B - movie action adventures with Johnny Weismeller from the 1940 's . In fact , I would hesitate to call it an action movie . Instead , it is a serious drama that takes all of E.R. Burrough 's material seriously , showing Tarzan 's quest to discover his real family in Scotland after realizing that he does n't fit in as a "" white ape . "" He is torn in between his old family and his new one , which includes a wonderful Sir Ralph Richardson in his final role . In an attempt to adapt to humans , his ape instincts also kick in , and he ca n't decide what he loves more : His real family , or the one that he 's always known . All in all , it is a wonderful commentary on society , and a wonderful character study . If nothing else , it launched Lambert into international stardom , which continued will into the 1980 's with films like "" Highlander "" and "" he Sicilian . "" Unfortunately , it did n't last . But just wait a while ....

27946,0,"I finally got a chance to settle in and compare the two versions of this film currently going around -- First , the good old scummy , sleazy Embassy VHS print called SCREAMERS , and then a new fully restored Italian DVD by everyone 's new favorite media company , No Shame of Italy . The American adverts about "" men turned inside out "" is as everyone says , totally misleading , and indicative of a Roger Cormanized take on what otherwise would be a superior fantasy - adventure thriller for grown ups . The complete Italian version is a somewhat sprawling , well designed and deliberately paced take on "" Island of Dr. Moreau "" , and there 's nothing wrong with that . It 's a sumptuous , handsome Euro Horror outing with a brain , good plotting , character development , location shooting , period costuming and sets , etc . But I must admit that the 14 year old knucklehead weed puffer still lurking somewhere inside of me got a bigger kick out of the more lurid , sleazy and unkempt Roger Corman version , which has some nice over the top gore , a flashy but preposterous opening segment , and then the bulk of Martino 's original film , albeit somewhat abridged to make room for Roger 's idea of entertainment . The pacing was somewhat quicker , the shock sequences closer together , and you see just as much of Ms. Bach 's fantastic form as you do in the extended Italian version . I still do n't have much of an idea about what the specific story concerns though : there are a number of plot twists and incidental characters that were somewhat hard to keep track of . A local voodoo subplot did n't help much , and it 's funny how everything culminates in just another fistfight between the noble castaway prisoner and the mad scientist ... Perhaps a few more viewings are in order . I will say this : Fans of the movie should avail themselves of one of these PAL imports and take a look at what is actually a movie rather than just another murky old home video -- the widescreen shot compositions once again reveal that Martino had an eye for filling his screen with interesting stuff . Nobody gets their heads ripped off like in the SCREAMERS print , but it 's still interesting stuff , and once again proof that while his standards may have been pretty much confined to the area around the gutter , Roger Corman new good trashy fun when he had it made for him , and side by side these are actually better movies than they had to be.7/10",462,1,0.000266666666666691,0.0836172948322075,0.000266666666666691,0.000266666666666691,0.000266666666666691,0.000266666666666691,0.000266666666666691,0.016697621070196428,0.06333099784280471,0.000266666666666691,0.000266666666666691,0.000266666666666691,0.000266666666666691,0.000266666666666691,0.000266666666666691,0.000266666666666691,0.07051471119822846,0.000266666666666691,0.000266666666666691,0.000266666666666691,0.2592083051063118,0.09518480206502743,0.000266666666666691,0.09097336027055994,0.000266666666666691,0.000266666666666691,0.000266666666666691,0.000266666666666691,0.000266666666666691,0.000266666666666691,0.000266666666666691,0.013797586382138134,0.000266666666666691,0.000266666666666691,0.000266666666666691,0.000266666666666691,0.000266666666666691,0.000266666666666691,0.000266666666666691,0.000266666666666691,0.000266666666666691,0.000266666666666691,0.000266666666666691,0.09941968409188755,0.08341911349701595,0.11343652364362136,0.000266666666666691,0.000266666666666691,0.000266666666666691,0.000266666666666691,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0
28252,0,"I see alot of movies at the cinema ( 103 so far this year ) and I have to say that this is by far and away the best film I have seen this year , even though it was released back in 1954!I sat in awe and watched this work of genius and felt quite ashamed that I had never even heard of it before my local art house cinema decided to show it for a week on what looked like a new print . The best part of the whole movie has to be the 28 minute break in where there is no speech and no music , merely the sound of the men carrying out the heist . Pure quality . Although really dark in places it is lightened with the dry humour . Not many films score 10 out of 10 but this does and also gets a gold star for effort ! !

28290,0,""" Saturday Afternoon "" is one of Harry Langdon 's best - known short subjects , and with good reason . It is one of his funniest and best films . The plot -- such as it is -- is an old staple : a hen - pecked husband sneaks away for a night out with a his pal and a couple of other girls . It 's a solid and well - used comedy plot , but the difference here is Harry Langdon himself . His slow , ineffectual , befuddled , innocent character has somehow floundered his way into a marriage with a woman who feels that he of all people must be ruled with an iron fist , and he is only thrust into cheating on her because he ca n't say "" no "" to the exhortations of the chummy Vernon Dent and the cute eyelash - fluttering of the girl . It 's a very adult problem to be thrust onto such a helpless , childlike character . Harry does n't want to cheat , but he ca n't do anything about it . In a wonderful bit of comic business , he ca n't bring himself to blow the new girlfriend kiss goodbye : he slyly pushes the kiss at her underhand and ashamedly wipes off his hand as if to chastise it . The film is a three - reel comedy , ten minutes longer than the two - reelers Harry Langdon had previously been starring in for Mack Sennett , with no more plot . Perhaps it was even designed to be a two - reeler . This works beautifully , since it gives him as much time as he needs to inject the slow reactions and bewildered glimpses and half - actions where so much of his comedy lives . He 's at his best here , and the show is really Harry Langdon 's curious magic and ability to spin comedy out of almost nothing . His little half- smiles , his look while handling the money he has hidden under the rug , childlike attempts to enter the fight at the end . I think his comedy makes us recognize something fundamentally innocent and confused in ourselves that makes us feel like the whole world is too much for us , yet at the same time , by allowing us to understand what Harry does not ( such as the fact that the women he good - heartedly brings to his friend to cheer him after he thinks the date has been blown are in fact whores ) he forces his to realize with a little bit of sadness that we are not that innocent anymore . His comedy is just as capable of making us audibly say "" Awwww "" as it is making us laugh , often at once . Here Harry wants to refuse to cheat on his wife , he wants to tell his wife whose boss and take some power back in his relationship , he wants to fight back against the two violent men at the end of the film , but he just ca n't affect his surroundings that much , and sometimes we all feel like that . The film is perfectly directed by frequent Langdon director Harry Edwards ; it moves at a quick pace and never stalls while at the same time making time for and presenting to best effect Harry Langdon 's still , reactive comedy . Vernon Dent , a frequent foil to Langdon , plays one of the roles here where he becomes almost a comedy partner in his very effective pairing with Harry . The gags spaced out in a way that gives maximum effect too , and Harry gets his own version of a Lloyd or Keaton style stunt at the end . Here the comedy is not in Harry 's big reactions to the danger of sitting perched between two moving cars , but in his slowness to take it in . This is a hilarious film , and a perfect example of the comedy of one of the most unique an talented humorists that I know ever to have existed .",709,1,0.12854051346002843,0.00017391304347827639,0.00017391304347827639,0.00017391304347827639,0.00017391304347827639,0.00017391304347827639,0.00017391304347827639,0.11968458276314768,0.02588875310850407,0.00017391304347827639,0.00017391304347827639,0.011295692851228271,0.00017391304347827639,0.00017391304347827639,0.017539217939846998,0.00017391304347827639,0.052981055666415915,0.00017391304347827639,0.008865288176666118,0.00017391304347827639,0.4014810692835974,0.00017391304347827639,0.00017391304347827639,0.00017391304347827639,0.00017391304347827639,0.00017391304347827639,0.036820156606546674,0.00017391304347827639,0.00017391304347827639,0.012108685395001118,0.00017391304347827639,0.00017391304347827639,0.00017391304347827639,0.00017391304347827639,0.00017391304347827639,0.00017391304347827639,0.00017391304347827639,0.00017391304347827639,0.00017391304347827639,0.017799165102616383,0.00017391304347827639,0.012207162886390944,0.00017391304347827639,0.14835387415131376,0.00017391304347827639,0.00017391304347827639,0.00017391304347827639,0.00017391304347827639,0.00017391304347827639,0.00017391304347827639,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

I mean , it really helps you to not notice the boom mikes when you watch it again .",164,1,0.000625000000000042,0.000625000000000042,0.000625000000000042,0.000625000000000042,0.000625000000000042,0.000625000000000042,0.000625000000000042,0.048311846408915005,0.000625000000000042,0.000625000000000042,0.000625000000000042,0.000625000000000042,0.34439816504213355,0.000625000000000042,0.000625000000000042,0.000625000000000042,0.000625000000000042,0.000625000000000042,0.000625000000000042,0.000625000000000042,0.5779149885489492,0.0006250000000004504,0.000625000000000042,0.000625000000000042,0.000625000000000042,0.000625000000000042,0.000625000000000042,0.000625000000000042,0.000625000000000042,0.000625000000000042,0.000625000000000042,0.000625000000000042,0.000625000000000042,0.000625000000000042,0.000625000000000042,0.000625000000000042,0.000625000000000042,0.000625000000000042,0.000625000000000042,0.000625000000000042,0.000625000000000042,0.000625000000000042,0.000625000000000042,0.000625000000000042,0.000625000000000042,0.000625000000000042,0.000625000000000042,0.000625000000000042,0.000625000000000042,0.000625000000000042,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

28945,0,"What is worth mentioning that is omitted in the other reviews I have read here , is the subtext of how the law shaped the lives and behaviour of gays in the era portrayed in the film . While Courtenay 's character is evidently gay , he is not the only one : the often talked about Mr. Davenport - Scott is the other , and the reason that he is never seen , the reason alluded to that he has disappeared seems to be that he has been detained by the police for homosexual activity - a criminal offense in England at the time . We can read under the surface that this recent event has unsettled Norman , Courtenay 's character : and we can also see in a passing remark by Oxenby , the Edward Fox character , the quick renunciation of any connection to such a person when the law is involved : the fear of association affects many of the characters , and is part of the portrait the film paints of a time and the people who inhabit it . The abandonment of Courtenay at the end by Sir has been anticipated all the way through , if this subtext is included : it also makes sense of both the otherwise inexplicable omission of his Dresser from the list of those he gives thanks to . The flamboyance combined with the fear of exposure produces the combination of yearning and fear that Courtenay has to ' step into the footlights ' , as he does when he makes the announcement about the imminent air raids , a scene that would otherwise be gratuitous , but that is both a symbolic and literal depiction of the man 's inner torment . So while the drama is of the decline of Finney 's Sir , a great deal of the tragedy of the film and play comes from the ' fatal flaw ' of Courtenay 's gayness , and makes this a film about him , as the title suggests . The art direction , pacing and cinematic style of this film seem to come from another time , more distant than the eighties and , in some ways , even than the second world war . The implicit portrait of a society still clinging to an older moral order , and the sympathy of the character racked and ruined by the cruelties of that order , of necessity trapped in the enclosed world of the theatre ; and the knowledge we have of how much of it all would be swept away after the war makes this film all the more poignant , for all its flaws .",453,1,0.0003773584905660621,0.0003773584905660621,0.0003773584905660621,0.0003773584905660621,0.023246292535286973,0.0003773584905660621,0.0003773584905660621,0.2992244614448628,0.05536031696242232,0.0003773584905660621,0.0003773584905660621,0.0003773584905660621,0.0003773584905660621,0.0003773584905660621,0.0003773584905660621,0.0003773584905660621,0.0003773584905660621,0.0003773584905660621,0.0003773584905660621,0.0003773584905660621,0.0003773584905660621,0.0003773584905660621,0.0003773584905660621,0.0003773584905660621,0.0003773584905660621,0.0003773584905660621,0.0003773584905660621,0.0003773584905660621,0.0003773584905660621,0.0003773584905660621,0.0003773584905660621,0.06597435323489798,0.0003773584905660621,0.0003773584905660621,0.0003773584905660621,0.0003773584905660621,0.10424704851791243,0.0003773584905660621,0.0003773584905660621,0.0003773584905660621,0.0003773584905660621,0.0003773584905660621,0.0003773584905660621,0.4353437537197107,0.0003773584905660621,0.0003773584905660621,0.0003773584905660621,0.0003773584905660621,0.0003773584905660621,0.0003773584905660621,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
28992,0,"I saw One Life Stand when it premiered at the 2000 Edinburgh International Film Festival and was blown away by it . Made on a micro budget , this black and white digital movie is very much a European film and succeeds brilliantly in spite of the limitations of DV . The film works because it 's in the indie tradition - dealing with complex issues , yet moving and relieved by touches of understated humour . One Life Stand avoids falling into the trap of other UK realist films , with ordinary working people portrayed as either hopeless victims or comedic stereotypes . The performances are strong , particularly Maureen Carr as the mother , Trise . I understand the film has recently been released on DVD and I would definitely recommend it . The rating on this site is misleading , which is why I gave it a high score because the filmmaker , May Miles Thomas obviously put her heart and soul into it and deserves better than 2.8 for her amazing achievement .",177,1,0.0006250000000000654,0.0006250000000000654,0.0006250000000000654,0.0006250000000000654,0.0006250000000000654,0.0006250000000000654,0.04237022318110532,0.08095455007278175,0.0006250000000000654,0.0006250000000000654,0.0006250000000000654,0.029061666651686874,0.0006250000000000654,0.0006250000000000654,0.0006250000000000654,0.0006250000000000654,0.0006250000000000654,0.0006250000000000654,0.0006250000000000654,0.0006250000000000654,0.06272070675321761,0.0006250000000000654,0.0006250000000000654,0.0006250000000000654,0.0006250000000000654,0.039664035661133384,0.0006250000000000654,0.0006250000000000654,0.0006250000000000654,0.10370216286977121,0.0006250000000000654,0.0006250000000000654,0.0006250000000000654,0.0006250000000000654,0.026510789426328382,0.11642863917370304,0.0006250000000000654,0.0006250000000000654,0.0006250000000000654,0.0006250000000000654,0.0006250000000000654,0.06942726371804119,0.0006250000000000654,0.40415996249222863,0.0006250000000000654,0.0006250000000000654,0.0006250000000000654,0.0006250000000000654,0.0006250000000000654,0.0006250000000000654,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
29228,0,"Chop Shop . Written and directed by Ramin Bahrani ( Man Push Cart ) . Bahrani specializes in character driven studies in naturalist style films about the sort of little people that get passed by every day , without anyone ever really noticing they are there , in New York . These are people who have been pushed to the very fringe of society . They exist in a sort of grey world , many of them migrants whose legal status in America is appears somewhat doubtful . Where do they come from ? How did they get there ? How do they cope ? Where will they end up ? These are not feel good stories as such , but stories about survival at its most basic , day to day level . Ale is one such street kid . He has no education and hustles anyway he can , to save money , he is also not beyond turning to petty theft . Mostly he is anxious to be reunited with his older sister . We see him in the early scenes ringing a safe house looking for her , but not having any real success . A young friend , Carlos gets him a job in a chop shop , in the shadows of Shea baseball stadium . Eventually his older sister comes to live on site with him , but he is jealous of the motives of her friends and suspicious of how she makes extra money . He dreams of buying a food van and setting up a vending business with his older sister . Bahrani shoots all his films on location . There is nothing glossy or glossed over about them . This is life as these people have to live it , in the raw . lt is not pretty although it is never ominous , and the slightly despairing air that hangs over much of the film , is the same one that hangs over these peoples ' everyday lives . The script is also very natural and the characters are given plenty of scope and room to work in . Polanco is outstanding in the lead role , and Gonzalez gives solid support as the older sister .",377,1,0.0463431821961205,0.08813611564634681,0.000333333333333366,0.000333333333333366,0.000333333333333366,0.000333333333333366,0.000333333333333366,0.40932658723476045,0.000333333333333366,0.000333333333333366,0.000333333333333366,0.000333333333333366,0.000333333333333366,0.000333333333333366,0.01699999999999947,0.000333333333333366,0.016004096184105265,0.000333333333333366,0.000333333333333366,0.018214360925024004,0.000333333333333366,0.07648476088321185,0.000333333333333366,0.000333333333333366,0.000333333333333366,0.000333333333333366,0.02244108926480977,0.000333333333333366,0.000333333333333366,0.000333333333333366,0.000333333333333366,0.000333333333333366,0.000333333333333366,0.000333333333333366,0.06317175572886768,0.000333333333333366,0.000333333333333366,0.000333333333333366,0.000333333333333366,0.06564708641812152,0.000333333333333366,0.000333333333333366,0.000333333333333366,0.16423096551863128,0.000333333333333366,0.000333333333333366,0.000333333333333366,0.000333333333333366,0.000333333333333366,0.000333333333333366,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

29610,0,"I have to admit that I had low expectations for this movie . But I was surprised to find it entertaining , interesting , and funny . It 's an entertaining thriller and not so much a horror film . There were moments that made my hairs stand up ! Even better , though , were the highly amusing , occasionally hysterical , comedic moments in the film ( you 'll know which ones I 'm talking about ) . There also are a few great special effects ( and the humor and the special effects are n't necessarily separate).The acting , on the whole , is very good -- way better than a typical low budget horror film . The lead ( Jackie ) , in particular , and many of the smaller , supporting roles ( like the lawyer , the couple living next door , the pizza man ) are well acted . If they had n't been , the film would n't have kept my interest and I would have lost my belief in the story .

30363,0,""" The bad dreams always come back again like unwanted friends , "" says Marion Fairlie , who with her half - sister , Laura , lives in a vast mid - Victorian country estate . "" And last night I found myself in Limmeridge churchyard . Normally , people who are dead stay dead , just as normally it is the criminals who are locked up rather than the victims . But then , there was nothing normal about what happened to us ... "" And we 're off on a first - class Gothic story of madness , deception and villainy , based on Wilkie Collins ' great novel of Victorian mystery . It 's a good idea to pay close attention , because there are plots within plots , yet they all center on a cunning and ruthless scheme which involves , what else , money , lots of money . Marion Fairlie ( Tara Fitzgerald ) and her sister , Laura Fairlie ( Justine Wadell ) are devoted to each other . Marion is fierce and protective ; Laura is softer and much more romantic . Marion has no money of her own ; Laura will inherit riches when she comes of age . Marion has no marriage prospects that we know of ; Laura has been pledged sometime ago to Sir Percival Glyde ( James Wilby ) , an altogether too charming aristocrat . They are the wards of their uncle , a fussy , condescending , immensely self - centered hypochondriac ( Ian Richardson ) . All seems to be quite routine , but then a young artist , Walter Hartright ( Andrew Lincoln ) , is engaged to teach them drawing and artistic appreciation . And when he arrives at night to the local train station , there is no carriage , so off he sets out on foot to the estate . In the dark woods he encounters a strange woman , dressed all in white , wandering about and speaking of things he does not understand , who then disappears . Are we uneasy ? Yes , and so is he and the sisters when they come to realize the strange woman looks much like Laura . Later , does love emerge between Walter and Laura ? Does a bud bloom ? Is there a misunderstanding that sends Walter away and results in Laura marrying Sir Percival ? Does a canker gnaw ? And do secrets slowly come to light about the relationships among Laura , Marian and the woman in white ... do we learn to be deeply suspicious of Sir Percival 's intentions ... do we come to enjoy the style and manners of Sir Percival 's close friend , Count Fosco ( Simon Callow) ... and do we eventually realize the foul depths of depravity , as well as the power of honor and true love , that humanity is capable of ? Do we visit Victorian insane asylums , see falls from high towers , dig open graves in the middle of the night and watch retribution arrive amidst the roaring flames of a locked church ? Well , of course , and it 's a grand journey for us . This BBC / Masterpiece Theater program features fine acting and outstanding production values . To fit Collins ' 500-plus - page novel into a television show of less than 120 minutes means a good deal had to be cut or abridged , and some changes were made most likely to achieve greater impact in the little time available . Still , taken on its own terms , the production of The Woman in White in my opinion works very well as a moody , romantic , dark television tale . Tara Fitzgerald as Marion gives a commanding performance as a woman determined to protect and then save her sister . James Wilby as Sir Percival manages the clever feat of slowly letting us see the depraved slime beneath the skin , who still has charm amidst the villainy . Ian Richardson as the young women 's uncle almost steals the show . He gives such a bossy and pungent performance it almost unbalances the story every time he appears . Perhaps the weakest of the main parts is Simon Callow as Count Fosco . The Count is simply a monster , yet a supremely civilized and charming one . Collins described him as being of immense girth . Callow does a fine , mannered job of it , but to me he lacks a little of the monstrosity of evil .

30466,0,"This is a well - crafted piece from everyone 's favorite master of suspense . As usual , the technical elements such as camera work and lighting are outstanding ( especially for the film 's time ) . I did not find the first part of the film very exciting , but the latter one certainly made up for it with one thrilling scene after another . The only thing I did not like about this movie was the choice of Farley Granger for the part of Guy Haines . Somehow , I did n't find him very believable . On the other hand , Robert Walker shines as sinister ' bad guy ' Bruno Anthony .

30910,0,"I 've read a lot of reviews about Showtime on IMDb and many seem to miss the mark . I 've noticed a lot of reviewers calling this the typical "" buddy "" film . De Niro is in no way Murphy 's buddy throughout most of this movie . In fact , part of the comedy of this film is De Niro 's reluctance to be friends with anybody . Murphy really shines in this one . He is back at doing what he does best , acting like a complete ham . He is a cop who wants so much to be an actor and enjoys being in the reality show . De Niro is perfect as the straight man who thinks the entire thing is stupid . I thought the two of them had great chemistry and were a perfect casting choice . Rene Russo is also great as the TV producer . Of course , she loves everything Murphy does and tries so hard ( along with Murhpy ) to get DeNiro going too . A lot of reviewers have touched on the hilarious scene with William Shatner , reprising his role as TJ Hooker to train Murhpy & De Niro how to "" act "" like cops . But , my favorite scene involves Murphy in the "" confessional "" hoping he could get a Wesly Snipes - Like cop to team up with instead of De Niro . Man , that was hilarious ! Comedies often depend on your personal tastes . Sure you could poke holes in the plot , most often you can with a comedy . I was psyched to see the pairing of Murphy and De Niro ... I think it brought out the best in Murphy , which was nice to see him at the top of his game again . I can only imagine it was a great honor for Murphy to be paired with the great De Niro . Rating 8 of 10 stars .",338,1,0.00034482758620692233,0.00034482758620692233,0.00034482758620692233,0.00034482758620692233,0.14120409360554506,0.00034482758620692233,0.00034482758620692233,0.00034482758620692233,0.00034482758620692233,0.00034482758620692233,0.00034482758620692233,0.00034482758620692233,0.15159895740911597,0.00034482758620692233,0.00034482758620692233,0.00034482758620692233,0.00034482758620692233,0.00034482758620692233,0.00034482758620692233,0.00034482758620692233,0.6504944227862796,0.00034482758620692233,0.00034482758620692233,0.00034482758620692233,0.00034482758620692233,0.00034482758620692233,0.00034482758620692233,0.00034482758620692233,0.00034482758620692233,0.00034482758620692233,0.00034482758620692233,0.00034482758620692233,0.00034482758620692233,0.00034482758620692233,0.00034482758620692233,0.00034482758620692233,0.00034482758620692233,0.017713571548596443,0.00034482758620692233,0.00034482758620692233,0.00034482758620692233,0.00034482758620692233,0.00034482758620692233,0.00034482758620692233,0.00034482758620692233,0.00034482758620692233,0.023471713271151277,0.00034482758620692233,0.00034482758620692233,0.00034482758620692233,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
30994,0,"I always liked listening to Buddy Holly and felt a real loss when he was killed at a young age in an airplane crash . He was n't in the old rock ' n roll class of , let 's say , Chuck Berry or Jerry Lee Lewis , but he was n't far behind . Who knows how big his legacy would have been had he sang for decades . Almost every single he put out was a hit . So , I was very pleasantly surprised how good a job Gary Busey did at playing him and at imitating his singing voice . He did Buddy proud , as were the actors ( Don Stroud and Charles Martin Smith ) who played Holly 's backup group , "" The Crickets . ""Music - wise , there are some of Holly 's better - known songs in the beginning of the film and its really good with a strong finish at the end as Holly and the boys are shown in Iowa in their last concert ever . Busey not only sings like Holly , he 's a dead ringer for him in the looks department . Some thing was the actor ' 's best performance ever , and you get no argument from me . I'm also glad they ended the film on an upbeat note with that Iowa concert , instead of dwelling on his tragic accident . The ending could have been a real downer , but they did n't let it be .",258,1,0.00046511627906980775,0.00046511627906980775,0.00046511627906980775,0.00046511627906980775,0.00046511627906980775,0.00046511627906980775,0.00046511627906980775,0.00046511627906980775,0.00046511627906980775,0.00046511627906980775,0.00046511627906980775,0.00046511627906980775,0.00046511627906980775,0.00046511627906980775,0.00046511627906980775,0.00046511627906980775,0.05733485419564455,0.00046511627906980775,0.00046511627906980775,0.00046511627906980775,0.5630655461203831,0.09063244606272089,0.00046511627906980775,0.00046511627906980775,0.00046511627906980775,0.00046511627906980775,0.00046511627906980775,0.00046511627906980775,0.00046511627906980775,0.0522350884354381,0.00046511627906980775,0.00046511627906980775,0.0837983613265439,0.00046511627906980775,0.00046511627906980775,0.00046511627906980775,0.00046511627906980775,0.00046511627906980775,0.00046511627906980775,0.00046511627906980775,0.00046511627906980775,0.02934295565716794,0.00046511627906980775,0.10359074820209968,0.00046511627906980775,0.00046511627906980775,0.00046511627906980775,0.00046511627906980775,0.00046511627906980775,0.00046511627906980775,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
31023,0,"My friends and went through a period of time when we would rent movies that none of us had ever heard of . The only good that came from it was this movie , "" Take it to Limit "" Right as the movie started , we could tell we were in for a true classic . The music is probably done by rural white boys from Colorado , but it sounds just like early 90 's rap . The star of the show , actor Leo Fitzpatrick , plays the bad - boy so well , especially sporting a big zit the entire movie . This movie is based on climbing , and I 'm not a climber , yet even I think it 's hilarious when they have the climber struggling to climb and there 's a guy in the background who is basically walking up the ' cliff ' .

31289,0,"Although it does n't seem very promising for a long stretch , Renoir 's French Cancan ends up being an effortlessly charming film . The story is cliché : a laundry girl , Nini ( Françoise Arnoul ) , is discovered by a night club owner , Danglard ( Jean Gabin ) . Danglard steals her from her baker boyfriend and drops his current girlfriend , both of whom come back for their former lovers . Nini has to choose whether to go back to her humble life with the baker , go on with the show with her employer , oh , or become a princess , as a prince falls in love with her at one point , too . I 'm glad the film did n't go for the most obvious choice , as a lesser film certainly would have . The film ends with the opening of Danglard 's new night club , the Moulin Rouge , and a couple of gorgeous song and dance numbers . The first of them , "" Complainte de la Butte , "" which also provides the base of most of the film 's musical score , is simply one of the most gorgeous songs ever written , and Renoir himself wrote it . If you 're a fan of Baz Luhrmann 's 2001 film Moulin Rouge ! , you 'll recognize the tune , as it comes up near the beginning of that film , sung by Rufus Wainwright . Although it is n't very prominent in that film , everyone I know who owns the soundtrack loves it . In addition to having one of the most lovely songs ever written , French Cancan also boasts one of the cutest leading ladies ever to grace the screen . It 's hard not to fall head - over - heels in love with that girl . 8/10 .",319,1,0.0005128205128205614,0.04764523307528733,0.0005128205128205614,0.0277134662715099,0.0005128205128205614,0.0005128205128205614,0.0005128205128205614,0.1587677730518485,0.0005128205128205614,0.0005128205128205614,0.0005128205128205614,0.0005128205128205614,0.061476279255076836,0.0005128205128205614,0.0005128205128205614,0.0005128205128205614,0.0005128205128205614,0.0005128205128205614,0.0005128205128205614,0.0005128205128205614,0.0005128205128205614,0.0005128205128205614,0.0005128205128205614,0.035495939089048474,0.061395822783581994,0.05477435650392429,0.0005128205128205614,0.0005128205128205614,0.0005128205128205614,0.0005128205128205614,0.0005128205128205614,0.0005128205128205614,0.0005128205128205614,0.0005128205128205614,0.0005128205128205614,0.0005128205128205614,0.0005128205128205614,0.0005128205128205614,0.0005128205128205614,0.0005128205128205614,0.0005128205128205614,0.0005128205128205614,0.0005128205128205614,0.4568253199239194,0.0005128205128205614,0.0748801690201601,0.0005128205128205614,0.0005128205128205614,0.0005128205128205614,0.0005128205128205614,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0

Watch his work in ' Tommy Boy ' , he 's so much at ease . He delivered fantastic performances later on in films like ' Berverly Hills Ninja ' & ' Almost Heroes ' , but his work in here remains as his best to date ! Love you , Farley !

31582,0,"I went to see this movie with a lady freind of mine , who does n't like heist movies . But she enjoyed it . I missed bits and pieces of the movie all the way through It is a story about Edward Norton and a crew stealing some gold , and Norton deciding he wants it all to himself . Then the people he betrayed want to get back at him . It is a well put together , intellegent , funny , and action packed film that I need to see again ... the whole way through . One of my top movies of the Summer so far . A big help to the entertainment factor is Seth Green . I do nt know anyone who does nt like Seth Green , and he adds to the flavor . He plays a guy who says he created Napster , and his roomate stole it from him . He is a computer genious who is a wonder to watch . It was said that Norton did n't want to do this film .. but If I were him , I would have wanted to sign on . The only problem is that it is very predictable . Any movie go - er should be able to say in their own mind what is happening , before it happens . My biggest complaint with the film , is Eddie Nortons choice of facial hair . The thick , yet thin mustache , and a small pike on his chin ... he looks like an 80 's porn star for gods sake .",272,1,0.00042553191489364727,0.00042553191489364727,0.00042553191489364727,0.00042553191489364727,0.00042553191489364727,0.05696753272148089,0.02170212775977552,0.00042553191489364727,0.00042553191489364727,0.00042553191489364727,0.00042553191489364727,0.00042553191489364727,0.00042553191489364727,0.00042553191489364727,0.00042553191489364727,0.00042553191489364727,0.00042553191489364727,0.00042553191489364727,0.00042553191489364727,0.00042553191489364727,0.6044054812900951,0.00042553191489364727,0.00042553191489364727,0.00042553191489364727,0.02181563911383803,0.00042553191489364727,0.00042553191489364727,0.00042553191489364727,0.00042553191489364727,0.00042553191489364727,0.00042553191489364727,0.00042553191489364727,0.03455844579197116,0.00042553191489364727,0.00042553191489364727,0.00042553191489364727,0.00042553191489364727,0.00042553191489364727,0.11891165624583182,0.00042553191489364727,0.00042553191489364727,0.00042553191489364727,0.00042553191489364727,0.1233412447365805,0.00042553191489364727,0.00042553191489364727,0.00042553191489364727,0.00042553191489364727,0.00042553191489364727,0.00042553191489364727,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

32677,0,"I watched this on HBO because it won the Oscar a week earlier . It compares favorably with fictional courtroom dramas . The story is of a 15-year - old black kid placed on trial for the Jacksonville , FL , murder of an elderly white woman based almost solely on the identification by the victim 's husband and on a confession that the defense contends was coerced . About half the footage is of the trial ; it 's supplemented with footage of the defense lawyers ( two public defenders ) explaining their case , interviewing witnesses , and visiting key locations . This is edited with a minimum of needless repetition , and placed in logical order . The camera work is pretty solid . And there 's a mildly surprising epilogue .",135,1,0.0011764705882353814,0.0011764705882353814,0.0011764705882353814,0.06000239380180056,0.0011764705882353814,0.0011764705882353814,0.0011764705882353814,0.0011764705882353814,0.0011764705882353814,0.0011764705882353814,0.0011764705882353814,0.0011764705882353814,0.0011764705882353814,0.0011764705882353814,0.060000000000003134,0.0011764705882353814,0.0011764705882353814,0.0011764705882353814,0.0011764705882353814,0.0011764705882353814,0.0011764705882353814,0.1791475290956016,0.09523375893967728,0.1077411793973534,0.0011764705882353814,0.0011764705882353814,0.0011764705882353814,0.0011764705882353814,0.0011764705882353814,0.0011764705882353814,0.0011764705882353814,0.0011764705882353814,0.0011764705882353814,0.0011764705882353814,0.0011764705882353814,0.1776470588235404,0.0011764705882353814,0.0011764705882353814,0.0011764705882353814,0.0011764705882353814,0.0011764705882353814,0.06421929468538969,0.0011764705882353814,0.0011764705882353814,0.0011764705882353814,0.20659702055074797,0.0011764705882353814,0.0011764705882353814,0.0011764705882353814,0.0011764705882353814,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1
33455,0,"I could n't stop watching this movie , though it was far past my bedtime . Comparisons to Hitchcock are deserved -- this thing really plays with you . It walks a wonderful line between real , immediate suspense and a dark , distancing humor . Like many of Hitch 's heroes , our doe - eyed mute witness has innocently stumbled into something truly horrific -- and we are taken on quite a ride with her , at turns identifying totally and feeling her fear , at turns watching in thrilling suspense as she is placed further in jeopardy . The filmmakers have put in a lot of tender care in working this out . Right from the opening shots , they engage and challenge you to determine what is real and what is fabrication ; who is to be trusted and who is a monster . The plot twists and turns unpredictably . Suspense is created with a combination of carefully chosen camerawork , imagery , music -- but most simply THE EYES of the characters , which sends raw fear right into you . A warning : there is some frighteningly real gore , as well as some nudity . The horror scenes are done in an emotional way that make them far more scary and disturbing than in any teenage - slasher pic . And a teen - slasher pic it AIN'T. The characters are quirky and feel like real people , for one thing -- a couple ( including the heroine ) you may even find endearing as I did . There will be no mistake you 're watching a movie made for grown - ups . I mean , Alec Guinness is in it , briefly , and you know he did n't NEED the work!Pop this in the VCR some night when you ca n't sleep . . . and do n't want to , yet .",324,1,0.25449455535301124,0.0003389830508474874,0.0003389830508474874,0.0003389830508474874,0.0003389830508474874,0.0003389830508474874,0.0003389830508474874,0.0003389830508474874,0.0003389830508474874,0.0003389830508474874,0.0003389830508474874,0.027180674731340795,0.0003389830508474874,0.0003389830508474874,0.0003389830508474874,0.0003389830508474874,0.0003389830508474874,0.0003389830508474874,0.0003389830508474874,0.0003389830508474874,0.5016305344788069,0.0003389830508474874,0.0003389830508474874,0.0003389830508474874,0.0003389830508474874,0.0003389830508474874,0.0003389830508474874,0.0003389830508474874,0.0003389830508474874,0.0003389830508474874,0.0003389830508474874,0.0003389830508474874,0.053397867243179714,0.0003389830508474874,0.0003389830508474874,0.0003389830508474874,0.0003389830508474874,0.0003389830508474874,0.0003389830508474874,0.0003389830508474874,0.0003389830508474874,0.0003389830508474874,0.0003389830508474874,0.0003389830508474874,0.08774617369970006,0.06063494025667175,0.0003389830508474874,0.0003389830508474874,0.0003389830508474874,0.0003389830508474874,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0
33464,0,"I am surprised that this , well above average 80 's comedy scores only a 5.2 from all the IMDB voters . Dan Ackroyd does his usual satirical turn as a con who seizes a great opportunity to steal a contract from his prisons physician . He retreats to California to start his work giving advice on a radio show pretending to be the infamous Dr Lawrence Baird . The only person that knows he 's an imposter is the drunken priest ( Walter Matthau ) who comes along to be pampered by Ackroyd 's new found wealth having blakmailed him . Charles Grodin throws in a good supporting performance too .

33664,0,"Having discovered the Ring trilogy , I have been greedily gobbling up all those other Japanese and Korean films that are either on or following the bandwagon . I do n't have an easy definition of horror , but this film certainly pushed some of my buttons , even though I ca n't claim that the film makes a lot of sense . I 'm squeamish so there were several points in the film when I just did n't want to watch what was happening on screen . The film unnerved me so I became apprehensive of seeing things that I thought I was going to see . It 's an imaginative film offering a great deal visually . It also provides food for thought . And plenty of material to argue about when the film is over . The characters are well - defined to say the least . Could they make films like this in the West?So it does n't make sense in the end , but when one has an appetite for the occult , the supernatural , the bizarre , the otherworldly , then no film is going to deliver a final all - explaining pay - off .",203,1,0.22407839472572944,0.0004651162790697992,0.024977690567818584,0.0004651162790697992,0.06257190530767597,0.0004651162790697992,0.0004651162790697992,0.0004651162790697992,0.0004651162790697992,0.0004651162790697992,0.0004651162790697992,0.0004651162790697992,0.0004651162790697992,0.0004651162790697992,0.0004651162790697992,0.0004651162790697992,0.0004651162790697992,0.0004651162790697992,0.0004651162790697992,0.0004651162790697992,0.0004651162790697992,0.0004651162790697992,0.0004651162790697992,0.0004651162790697992,0.0004651162790697992,0.0004651162790697992,0.0004651162790697992,0.0004651162790697992,0.0004651162790697992,0.0004651162790697992,0.0004651162790697992,0.0004651162790697992,0.0004651162790697992,0.0004651162790697992,0.0004651162790697992,0.0004651162790697992,0.0004651162790697992,0.0004651162790697992,0.0004651162790697992,0.0004651162790697992,0.0004651162790697992,0.0004651162790697992,0.0004651162790697992,0.5405545648953456,0.12688721194528937,0.0004651162790697992,0.0004651162790697992,0.0004651162790697992,0.0004651162790697992,0.0004651162790697992,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0
33790,0,"In Cold Mountain , North Colorado , near to the period of the American Civil War , the Reverend Monroe ( Donald Sutherland ) arrives in the small town with his daughter , the shy Ada Monroe ( Nicole Kidman ) , due to health reasons . Ada meets the also shy Inman ( Jude Law ) , and they fall in love with each other . With the beginning of the war , Inman becomes a soldier , and his great support to stay alive is the wish to see Ada in Cold Mountain again . Meanwhile , Ada meets Ruby Thewes ( Renée Zellweger ) , a survivor of the war , who helps her in the farm and becomes her best friend . The story alternates present and past situations , disclosing a beautiful romance . I liked this film a lot . Having names such as Philip Seymour Hoffman , Natalie Portman and Giovanni Ribisi in the supporting cast , a magnificent direction of Anthony Minghella and seven indications to the Oscar , this movie does not disappoint . My remark is that there are some very important scenes deleted in the story and presented in the DVD . At least one of them , which show what happens with Sara , her baby and the three dead bodies in her farm , should not be deleted as it was . My vote is nine .

33854,0,"Though it hardly compares to other sci - fi film giants like 2001 : A SPACE ODYSSEY or CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND , LIFEFORCE does work as a totally berserk and bizarre melding of science fiction and horror elements . Somehow , despite dialogue that approaches the ridiculous and acting that does the same , it manages to work because of a few highly different elements . Loosely based on Colin Wilson 's 1976 novel "" The Space Vampires "" , this film from director Tobe Hooper ( POLTERGEIST ; THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE ) focuses on a joint US - British mission aboard the British space shuttle Churchill to study Halley 's Comet . Led by an American commander ( Steve Railsback ) , they discover an alien spacecraft in the comet 's coma . And when they investigate the interior of the spacecraft , they find alien occupants that look like giant bats . Later on , the Churchill reaches Earth 's orbit , but no response is given from radio calls issued from the mission 's home base , the Space Research Center in London . Columbia is launched to rendezvous with Churchill , but they find the entire ship gutted by fire -- all except for the alien beings encased in glass who , far from being untouched by the fire , look absolutely perfect . The aliens are bought back to Earth ... and that 's where the incredible happens . These space vampires escape from the Space Research Center and , instead of draining their victims of blood via bite wounds , suck their victims ' lifeforce totally out of them . One of them is the Space Girl , a thoroughly nude vampiress played by Mathilda May. Railsback , the only actual survivor from Churchill , is bought in by the SRC 's chief ( Frank Finlay ) and a British special agent ( Peter Firth ) to track May , who is in telepathic contact with him . Pretty soon , however , the vampires have turned London into a scene of pure holocaust ; people are either being dessicated or turning into zombies , and the threat by NATO to sterilize the city with thermonuclear radiation looms large . Railsback finally catches up with May , and sacrifices himself by impaling her with a large metal sabre . Undoubtedly disjointed , unquestionably uneven , but nevertheless worth watching , LIFEFORCE , despite the frequent incoherency of its script and its acting , benefits from some drop - dead excellent special effects work by John Dykstra ( STAR WARS ) , some of the best ever seen . The other working element , and a surprise one it is , is the incredible orchestral score by Henry Mancini , almost Wagnerian in the same way John Williams ' score for STAR WARS was -- and Mancini , like Williams before him , uses the London Symphony Orchestra , to boot!Largely forgotten these days , and a critical and box office disaster in 1985 , LIFEFORCE , if for no other reason , should still be seen for anyone with a taste for the bizarre . There had never been a film quite like it before , and there will certainly not be anything like it again .",557,1,0.000243902439024421,0.09574072366480779,0.000243902439024421,0.000243902439024421,0.12485151383035727,0.000243902439024421,0.04134710785847528,0.06970135124617552,0.000243902439024421,0.000243902439024421,0.000243902439024421,0.0134265117171423,0.000243902439024421,0.000243902439024421,0.000243902439024421,0.000243902439024421,0.000243902439024421,0.03986127955405775,0.000243902439024421,0.000243902439024421,0.2365085349852432,0.000243902439024421,0.000243902439024421,0.000243902439024421,0.000243902439024421,0.000243902439024421,0.07127455066366822,0.000243902439024421,0.000243902439024421,0.000243902439024421,0.000243902439024421,0.01565733083919116,0.000243902439024421,0.000243902439024421,0.000243902439024421,0.000243902439024421,0.01728402489627876,0.000243902439024421,0.06787539917557978,0.000243902439024421,0.000243902439024421,0.000243902439024421,0.000243902439024421,0.19720337888609496,0.000243902439024421,0.000243902439024421,0.000243902439024421,0.000243902439024421,0.000243902439024421,0.000243902439024421,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
34203,0,"I viewed this movie for the first time last night and I enjoyed every aspect of it the dancing , the acting , the dialogue , the plot , the script and the whole atmosphere that this movie created . I would highly recommend it . Jennifer Grey gives an absolutely wonderful and first class performance in her role as Frances ( Baby ) Houseman . She has a natural ability and flair for dancing and she is beautiful and enchanting on the dance floor . But what is wonderful about Baby is that she has such a wonderful depth and dimension to her character . This is not simply a movie about dancing but the scriptwriters have also given us a chance to see Baby deal with the various emotions and feelings that she is experiencing throughout the movie and to allow us an insight into how her interaction with others at the camp changes her life . Grey portrays her character with such realism and poignancy that you end up feeling deeply for Baby as she experiences all she does in this movie . Patrick Swayze is magnificent in his role as Johnny and truly succeeds in making his character come alive . He gives his character a comprehensive personality , strong appeal and great depth . The chemistry between Swayze and Grey is enchanting and powerful and contributes significantly to the great success of this movie Cynthia Rhodes is great in her role of Penny and her portrayal of the ordeal that she experiences is truly powerful and contributes a frightening dimension to the film . The other members of the supporting cast Jerry Orbach and the late Mark Cantor deserve a special mention here - also give wonderful and imaginative performances that gives this movie an additional dimension of high quality acting and believability that is wonderful to experience . The dancing is magnificent and first class on the part of all involved . The script and interaction between all the major characters is intriguing and engages the viewer in a powerful fashion . The plot , although exceedingly predictable , is given more than enough life and vitality to make this movie successful . Furthermore the wonderful selection of music contained in this movie creates a truly magical atmosphere and very nostalgic environment that enhances the quality and success of all the various scenes . `Dirty Dancing ' is a truly powerful , magnificent and very appealing movie that leaves you deeply touched and with a wonderful feeling in your heart and soul and an inspiration to dance . I highly recommend it",438,1,0.00024691358024693256,0.00024691358024693256,0.05527750631663185,0.00024691358024693256,0.04418950465282389,0.00024691358024693256,0.013230635504814743,0.07212506628514377,0.00024691358024693256,0.00024691358024693256,0.00024691358024693256,0.2223616882396886,0.00024691358024693256,0.00024691358024693256,0.00024691358024693256,0.00024691358024693256,0.00024691358024693256,0.00024691358024693256,0.00024691358024693256,0.00024691358024693256,0.42347868852397713,0.00024691358024693256,0.00024691358024693256,0.00024691358024693256,0.00024691358024693256,0.00024691358024693256,0.00024691358024693256,0.00024691358024693256,0.00024691358024693256,0.024778060816945474,0.00024691358024693256,0.00024691358024693256,0.00024691358024693256,0.00024691358024693256,0.00024691358024693256,0.00024691358024693256,0.00024691358024693256,0.00024691358024693256,0.00024691358024693256,0.00024691358024693256,0.00024691358024693256,0.00024691358024693256,0.00024691358024693256,0.13418847928960353,0.00024691358024693256,0.00024691358024693256,0.00024691358024693256,0.00024691358024693256,0.00024691358024693256,0.00024691358024693256,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
34255,0,"I read on the web that this film is being remade into a theatrical feature . Finally ! ! ! ! ! It 's about time Hollywood got their act together . The big Studios always frown at edgy material , with Oscar written all over it . Go figure!!JERICHO MILE was made ahead of it 's time . It 's a masterpiece . Michael Mann , a true visionary , found a way to engage an audience without overindulgence . Peter Strauss ' Emmy award performance is probably the best character role I 've seen in my film - viewing lifetime . Any actor who touches this role will never be the same ( unless an Academy Award is already sitting on their mantle).The gritty multi ethnic ensemble , a backdrop for THE JERICHO MILE makes one understand the delicate social dynamics of our world . This is about redemption without public validation , and the power of the human spirit overcoming all barriers . Imagine a convict imprisoned since he was a teenager for life with no chance of parole , that does n't know he is possibly the fastest runner in the world . ... what would you do??This movie makes you walk away feeling you have n't been cheated on any level .

34291,0,"A year after the release of the average "" House of Frankenstein "" , Universal released another Monster Mash where all their famous character would collide once again . "" House of Dracula "" would reunite Dracula , the Frankenstein 's creature and the Wolf Man for what would be their final battle and will finally close an era for the studio . Directed once again by Erle C. Kenton , "" House of Dracula "" presents a slight but noticeable improvement over the previous film and delivers a better constructed ( although still flawed ) story that while far from perfect , is a more appropriate closure than the previous film . The story ignores most of the events of the previous entry , "" House of Frankenstein "" , and introduces a new angle to the story . Count Dracula ( John Carradine ) , tired of having to hide during sunlight , asks help to the brilliant scientist , Dr. Edelman ( Onslow Stevens ) , a physician famous for his research in biology . Edelman becomes fascinated by Dracula , and soon begins an experimental treatment , in the mean time , Larry Talbot ( Lon Chaney Jr. ) , the Wolf Man , visits Edelman with the purpose of get rid of his curse . Soon Edelman realizes that Dracula is a monster that must be destroyed , but his own exposure to Dracula 's blood is also developing a disease in him . The discovery of the Frankenstein 's monster ( Glenn Strange ) in a nearby catacombs will bring more turmoil to the mind of the brilliant scientist . After the previous clash of monsters , it is good to see the series going back to the roots and delivering an almost straight - forward Gothic horror returning to the dark pessimistic nature of this kind of films and moving away from the comic relief of the previous entries . The story ( by Edward T. Lowe Jr. ) , has many interesting themes , as the contrast between Dracula and Talbot ( both looking for a cure , but with different purposes ) and Edelman 's increasing madness . Probably among the most interesting themes is the inclusion of the character of Nina , a gorgeous but deformed woman who aids Dr. Edelman hoping to be cured of her condition . Director Erle C. Kenton is back again and this time he finally captures the dark nature of these three characters , a nature that was apparently lost in the previous film . Despite the low - budget , Kenton crafts a Gothic horror that while simple , is quite effective , and even manages to present old partners such a these characters in a fresh way . While it 's never on the level of the originals , "" House of Dracula "" recovers that charm that Universal Studios horror films used to have , and Kenton makes sure that at least for a last time the monsters receive a chance to shine . The cast is very good this time , with Carradine , Chaney and Strange reprising their roles ( although Strange 's role is considerably smaller ) with more enthusiasm than in the previous film . The addition of Onslow Stevens , Jane Adams and Martha O'Driscoll to the cast bring back the tragedy and the drama to the series , with Stevens giving a terrific performance as Dr. Edelman . A small cameo by Lionel Atwill and the presence of Skelton Knaggs as the creepy Steinmuhl complete one of the better cast Universal horror films has had in years . ""House of Dracula "" is a nice addition to the series , specially after the mediocre "" House of Frankenstein "" . It 's nice to see Kenton back in form in a somewhat serious horror film , however , and while the plot is quite original , it suffers not only because of the budget , but because the film attempts to do a lot in a very short runtime with bad results . It 's true that the characters have all very inventive story lines , but the film dedicates very few time for each of them to develop , and the film seems very rushed and disjointed . While far from perfect , it 's also far from being the worst of the series . "" House of Dracula "" is a nice closure to one of the best times for the horror genre , a time when ghosts and ghouls roamed the foggy nights , and mad scientists gave life to hideous monsters . Later the monsters would be back in "" Bud Abbott & Lou Costello Meet Frankenstein "" ( 1948 ) , but that would be a whole different context . after the disappointing previous entries , it 's easy to dismiss "" House of Dracula "" , but give it a chance , and let the monster roam for a last time . 7/10",844,1,0.00015151515151516444,0.11137984635955282,0.00015151515151516444,0.013448652362904061,0.00015151515151516444,0.00015151515151516444,0.00015151515151516444,0.030132275038917515,0.04315500206582513,0.00015151515151516444,0.00015151515151516444,0.00015151515151516444,0.00015151515151516444,0.00015151515151516444,0.00015151515151516444,0.00015151515151516444,0.00015151515151516444,0.00015151515151516444,0.00015151515151516444,0.10987253577087394,0.00015151515151516444,0.04973975883993192,0.00015151515151516444,0.06785190106122384,0.00015151515151516444,0.00015151515151516444,0.03091978763568293,0.00015151515151516444,0.00015151515151516444,0.00015151515151516444,0.00015151515151516444,0.00015151515151516444,0.05446702991304925,0.00015151515151516444,0.00015151515151516444,0.00015151515151516444,0.00015151515151516444,0.00015151515151516444,0.00015151515151516444,0.00015151515151516444,0.08072007461561585,0.00015151515151516444,0.00015151515151516444,0.4024040454273312,0.00015151515151516444,0.00015151515151516444,0.00015151515151516444,0.00015151515151516444,0.00015151515151516444,0.00015151515151516444,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
34364,0,"A film of high intelligence and activity . As well as being a strong capsule of the time and persona that was the 60 's , the film is also TRULY a surprise in its forward - thinking themes and the unique presentation of the system of power in a group . William Greaves appoints himself to the authoritative role in the group . He asks his crew members to film and film and keep filming . First the two actors , then the crew filming the actors , then the entire set including bystanders , policemen , and finally a homeless man whose been living in bushes in Central Park for 9 weeks . Greaves edits the film ( thousands of feet ) together and surprisingly makes a strong narrative with an interesting arc and motivations . Do n't expect to be bored by this film . Each of crew make for engaging conversationalists and often times are voicing the thoughts that the observer has watching this film . Greaves does well at integrating the multiple camera takes using synchronized three - in - one pictures and other attention shifting methods . In the end , the film will really only be effective if it 's what YOU'RE looking for : if you 're looking for some abstract arty film that feeds your own self - indulgent ego while never having a point , look elsewhere . If you 're looking for a film that will have you talking and thinking long afterward about the desire for honesty and sincerity in documented "" reality "" and the inevitable transparency that comes of it , then this is the perfect film .",282,1,0.00040000000000003005,0.14923200749662655,0.00040000000000003005,0.00040000000000003005,0.00040000000000003005,0.00040000000000003005,0.00040000000000003005,0.055626944064721524,0.04654101130967998,0.00040000000000003005,0.00040000000000003005,0.00040000000000003005,0.00040000000000003005,0.00040000000000003005,0.00040000000000003005,0.00040000000000003005,0.00040000000000003005,0.00040000000000003005,0.00040000000000003005,0.00040000000000003005,0.00040000000000003005,0.00040000000000003005,0.00040000000000003005,0.00040000000000003005,0.00040000000000003005,0.048003853681787924,0.00040000000000003005,0.00040000000000003005,0.00040000000000003005,0.00040000000000003005,0.00040000000000003005,0.00040000000000003005,0.00040000000000003005,0.00040000000000003005,0.00040000000000003005,0.00040000000000003005,0.00040000000000003005,0.00040000000000003005,0.00040000000000003005,0.00040000000000003005,0.00040000000000003005,0.0591165214604684,0.00040000000000003005,0.5992614467977329,0.00040000000000003005,0.00040000000000003005,0.025018215188981417,0.00040000000000003005,0.00040000000000003005,0.00040000000000003005,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0

While Chayefsky deals with the reality behind the myths of many things including medicine , this work is surprisingly prophetic of the way medicine is going today , two decades after the movie was made and over a decade after his death . Beyond that , some insights into Chayefsky 's view of life in general are ' slipped into ' the movie as well .

34889,0,"This would definitely not have been my kind of movie , but my husband saw it on TV and said it was really good . So , on his recommendation , I bought a copy , since I did n't know if it would ever be on TV again . I had never heard of anybody in it except Armand Assante . At first I had a hard time getting into the story , because the first part of the movie is a jumble of images-- and it does n't make much sense . It is only later in the movie that it all comes together . The scene - cutting- if that 's what it 's called , is a bit jarring-- it sometimes looks as if a few frames have been cut out of each scene , and the scenes are jerky -- but I guess that was done to add to the unusualness ( if that 's a word ) . The story veers here and there , and just about the time you have it all figured out , everything turns upside down and you have to readjust your thinking as to who is the bad guy and who is not . Or bad woman . The acting is very good-- I kept thinking how much Norman Reedus looks like Leo Decaprio . The ending was a real twist , totally unexpected , which I liked . A good show .",245,1,0.070165385010211,0.00035087719298249173,0.00035087719298249173,0.00035087719298249173,0.00035087719298249173,0.00035087719298249173,0.00035087719298249173,0.00035087719298249173,0.00035087719298249173,0.00035087719298249173,0.00035087719298249173,0.00035087719298249173,0.056283042134039646,0.00035087719298249173,0.00035087719298249173,0.00035087719298249173,0.048700099663705324,0.041680611749346834,0.00035087719298249173,0.00035087719298249173,0.5145401504582392,0.202859781909708,0.00035087719298249173,0.00035087719298249173,0.00035087719298249173,0.00035087719298249173,0.05068320977650254,0.00035087719298249173,0.00035087719298249173,0.00035087719298249173,0.00035087719298249173,0.00035087719298249173,0.00035087719298249173,0.00035087719298249173,0.00035087719298249173,0.00035087719298249173,0.00035087719298249173,0.00035087719298249173,0.00035087719298249173,0.00035087719298249173,0.00035087719298249173,0.00035087719298249173,0.00035087719298249173,0.00035087719298249173,0.00035087719298249173,0.00035087719298249173,0.00035087719298249173,0.00035087719298249173,0.00035087719298249173,0.00035087719298249173,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
35303,0,"I must say I did n't expect much about this movie , but it turned out not to be bad at all . Most striking of course , was Aidan Quinn 's performance . I would never expect to see this fine actor as an action hero . The great thing about it is that he really builds up his character ( Annibal ) . I mean , it was not like Mel Gibson or Bruce Willis would do it , he was sensitive and modest . For example , he 's really upset when he kills someone . I also noticed that some clichés were avoided . When Annibal gets his training , you would easily expect him to be a rebel and act like any average American would do in such a situation , ask what the f * * * is going on and refusing to cooperate . But Annibal is a professional marine officer , he does n't give up and he tries not to lose his courage , in which he succeeds pretty well , except for a brief break - down on Christmas Eve , which I think was very realistic . I 'm glad that Aidan Quinn got this opportunity to show another side of him ( in fact two , because he plays the villain as well ) , even although the film was n't that successful .",236,1,0.0005882352941176867,0.0005882352941176867,0.0005882352941176867,0.0005882352941176867,0.043285402380874596,0.0005882352941176867,0.0005882352941176867,0.0005882352941176867,0.0005882352941176867,0.0005882352941176867,0.0005882352941176867,0.0005882352941176867,0.0005882352941176867,0.0005882352941176867,0.0005882352941176867,0.0005882352941176867,0.0005882352941176867,0.0005882352941176867,0.0005882352941176867,0.0005882352941176867,0.4104009133803403,0.21936776349440235,0.0005882352941176867,0.0005882352941176867,0.0005882352941176867,0.0005882352941176867,0.0005882352941176867,0.0005882352941176867,0.0005882352941176867,0.0005882352941176867,0.0005882352941176867,0.030208656579086873,0.0005882352941176867,0.0005882352941176867,0.0005882352941176867,0.0005882352941176867,0.0005882352941176867,0.0005882352941176867,0.07532932575763855,0.0005882352941176867,0.0005882352941176867,0.0005882352941176867,0.0005882352941176867,0.0005882352941176867,0.19552558546647902,0.0005882352941176867,0.0005882352941176867,0.0005882352941176867,0.0005882352941176867,0.0005882352941176867,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

The story was excellent although the twist at the end was far too predictable and I knew what would happen far too early . Usually when this happens the film is spoiled for me ( like "" The Others "" ) but even knowing the outcome I still enjoyed it right up to the end . Looking through the comments of others many people were impressed with the performance from Kelly Overton ( Eve ) , I 'm afraid I was not . Her performance seemed to be the weak part of the film to me , in contrast to the amazing performance ( or characterization ) by James Haven ( Don Wake ) ... I hope we see more of him . What a great little film , highly recommended to all !",153,1,0.0006896551724138439,0.0006896551724138439,0.0006896551724138439,0.0006896551724138439,0.0006896551724138439,0.0006896551724138439,0.0438010250286952,0.0006896551724138439,0.0006896551724138439,0.0006896551724138439,0.0006896551724138439,0.08148513827572731,0.0006896551724138439,0.0006896551724138439,0.0006896551724138439,0.0006896551724138439,0.0006896551724138439,0.0006896551724138439,0.0006896551724138439,0.0006896551724138439,0.07748457227382537,0.0006896551724138439,0.0006896551724138439,0.0006896551724138439,0.0006896551724138439,0.0006896551724138439,0.0006896551724138439,0.0006896551724138439,0.0006896551724138439,0.0006896551724138439,0.0006896551724138439,0.0006896551724138439,0.13763635210722452,0.0006896551724138439,0.17454496878656947,0.0006896551724138439,0.0006896551724138439,0.0006896551724138439,0.035410636540312394,0.0006896551724138439,0.0006896551724138439,0.0006896551724138439,0.0006896551724138439,0.4199821345738504,0.0006896551724138439,0.0006896551724138439,0.0006896551724138439,0.0006896551724138439,0.0006896551724138439,0.0006896551724138439,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
36053,0,"OK . So it can be done ! We have here the perfect vampire movie . Gothic , beautiful . With all the ingredients . A realistic vampire . A wonderful story . Take note - I am from Transylvania and I assure you , this movie respects the vampire lore ! It 's exactly like the tales I heard in my childhood . For a transylvanian , it is quite ... believable . You must see it , if you are interested by real vampires , as they were depicted in medieval chronicles and not how are they done in recent Hollywood movies ( as far as I can guess , the Hollywood problem is they mix vampires with the incubus - which is pretty hilarious for me . Vampires are never good - looking or attractive , they can inspire only horror and repulsion . The incubus - called in my country The Night Flier , is the one beautiful demon which kills his victims by loving them . ) I strongly recommend this for any Gothic person out there ! See also the sequels , they are all 4 very good ! And of course , do n't miss DArk shadows ! Something similar is Nosferatu In Venice with Klaus Kinski .

36394,0,"Like most sports movies which have come out in the past , this movie is similar in respects , that it is based on fact . What sets this movie apart is that its about a rugby team , a sport that not too many Americans are familiar with . Set that aside , this movie is very rewarding piece of film noir . It reminds me of "" We Are Marshall "" , but with a smaller budget and an independent movie feel . Its a fine effort by director Ryan Little to bring us a story about a rebellious teen played by Sean Farris ( Never Back Down ) , as Rick Penning that finds himself in an odd place , both on and off the field . Despite a few plot lines holes , this film has heart , rewarding each of its viewers with good characters that we can identify with . Also good performances by supporting actors Gary Cole as coach Larry Gelwix & Neal McDonough as coach Penning(Ricks dad ) . I felt myself go through a lot of different emotions watching movie , in the end I was left with a feeling of faith in mankind & a hope for the future for my children , especially if there are coaches out there like Gelwix .",223,1,0.00046511627906980173,0.00046511627906980173,0.00046511627906980173,0.00046511627906980173,0.00046511627906980173,0.00046511627906980173,0.00046511627906980173,0.00046511627906980173,0.00046511627906980173,0.00046511627906980173,0.00046511627906980173,0.00046511627906980173,0.00046511627906980173,0.00046511627906980173,0.018021430085008443,0.00046511627906980173,0.00046511627906980173,0.00046511627906980173,0.00046511627906980173,0.00046511627906980173,0.2899024135969943,0.15925480853343302,0.00046511627906980173,0.00046511627906980173,0.00046511627906980173,0.03152849770289727,0.00046511627906980173,0.00046511627906980173,0.00046511627906980173,0.00046511627906980173,0.00046511627906980173,0.00046511627906980173,0.00046511627906980173,0.00046511627906980173,0.1308698901662018,0.00046511627906980173,0.00046511627906980173,0.00046511627906980173,0.027353262554573005,0.00046511627906980173,0.00046511627906980173,0.00046511627906980173,0.00046511627906980173,0.32306969736089053,0.00046511627906980173,0.00046511627906980173,0.00046511627906980173,0.00046511627906980173,0.00046511627906980173,0.00046511627906980173,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
36398,0,"It helps that the characters this show is based on are among the best Disney has ever come up with . The writing is what really makes this show . It 's a total classic . Given , you need to appreciate the type of humor to enjoy it , and this is hard to explain . The humor is akin to the old school scenarios of 40 's and 50 's Disney , with modern spins . It never degrades into fart jokes or anything of that type . It 's not adam sandler humor either , though I have enjoyed that . It is the exact same humor of the movie , only expanded upon for the length of time a TV show permits . So if you did n't like it in the movie , you wo n't like it here , but IMO The emperors new groove was the best thing to come out of Disney since Gargoyles .

36462,0,"Saw this at Newport Beach Film Festival the other day . The film is REALLY exceptional . The crowd I went with all loved it . Funny , poignant and great acting . I 'm tired of the tried and true Hollywood romances , who can relate ? David Krumholtz ( Max ) is really amazing as the sure and true lover of the ultra - screwy Grace ( Natasha Lyonne , who is also excellent ) . When Max falls for Grace we believe it . Why ? Because love at first sight IS crazy and we 're dealing with two lost , and maybe not so crazy , souls .

36686,0,"I saw this documentary film at the 2005 Slamdance independent film festival . This documentary is shot , directed and edited by a son ( Craig ) of his mother 's year long battle with cancer . Shot over the course of one year "" The closer she gets "" , is a documentary in the truest form and gives you an inside look of a family 's struggle with battling with the cancer , the viewer gets an inside point of view of the effects cancer has on a family as well as the individual throughout the entire process . I have never seen such an honest film , this is a powerful and raw film , and since it was n't shot by an outsider you get the true emotions of everyone involved . Many documentaries are shot by an outsider , but having this story told by the son adds another emotional level to the film , unlike any I have seen before on this subject or any other . This is a touching story that everyone should see , and can relate to . I would highly recommend it .",194,1,0.000500000000000044,0.000500000000000044,0.000500000000000044,0.000500000000000044,0.000500000000000044,0.000500000000000044,0.03107979503599736,0.000500000000000044,0.000500000000000044,0.000500000000000044,0.000500000000000044,0.07113335068603169,0.000500000000000044,0.000500000000000044,0.000500000000000044,0.000500000000000044,0.0975077884298928,0.000500000000000044,0.000500000000000044,0.000500000000000044,0.000500000000000044,0.000500000000000044,0.000500000000000044,0.07371133150605265,0.000500000000000044,0.000500000000000044,0.000500000000000044,0.000500000000000044,0.000500000000000044,0.000500000000000044,0.000500000000000044,0.000500000000000044,0.000500000000000044,0.000500000000000044,0.000500000000000044,0.000500000000000044,0.000500000000000044,0.000500000000000044,0.000500000000000044,0.000500000000000044,0.000500000000000044,0.07713484580924762,0.000500000000000044,0.5072032372978935,0.000500000000000044,0.12072965123488244,0.000500000000000044,0.000500000000000044,0.000500000000000044,0.000500000000000044,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0

37431,0,"I finally managed to get myself a copy of Dario Argento 's Opera , and I tell you ... that was about time ! ! It was the last Argento movie I had yet to see and I 'm a fan of most of his work . I reckon that most of his work is extremely important for the genre of horror but some of his movies tend to disappoint ( like Phenomena ) . But the plot idea of Opera always appealed to me and it turns out I was right ! ! I enjoyed every shot in Opera and I was fascinated by this movie for the first minute till the last . Out of all the Argento movies , Opera went straight to the number one spot and I hope I can encourage as many people as possible to see this one as well . The script and plot - idea of Opera is rather simple . Especially compared to Argento 's previous movie Phenomena that had too many ideas in it , and ended up being a mess . The plot of Opera is creepy and chilling but at the same time it 's an excellent satiric comment - almost a spoof - towards the opponents of explicit violence . * * * SPOILERS * * * A young opera singer ( the gorgeous Cristina Marsillach ) is being stalked by a horribly sadistic murderer . During every massacre he commits , he forces Betty to watch his actions with her eyes wide open . There are needles attached to her eyelids and when she closes them , they 're getting torn apart . * * * END SPOILERS * * * . To this simple - yet effective - idea , Argento adds a lot of horrific elements like ravens , the classic piece ( and curse ) of MacBeth and the whole atmospheric location of the opera building and the music . Especially the presence of the creepy ravens are and extra value . Ancient masters like Edgar Allen Poe already knew these black birds have a lot of mystery hanging around them , and Dario Argento knows it as well . The violence and gore is very well presented in Opera and that 's what makes this a true Argento picture . His best in my opinion with Profondo Rosso as a close second . I surely hope to recommend this movie to a lot of people among you . Especially for fans of the ( Italian ) horror business , this is an absolute must ! Favorite "" Rewind""-scene : Argento shows his visual talent the best in the scene where Betty 's friend is getting shot in the eye while she 's trying to see who 's in front of the door .",472,1,0.2661909032486861,0.0002597402597402903,0.0002597402597402903,0.0002597402597402903,0.0002597402597402903,0.0002597402597402903,0.0002597402597402903,0.0002597402597402903,0.0002597402597402903,0.0002597402597402903,0.0002597402597402903,0.0002597402597402903,0.0002597402597402903,0.0002597402597402903,0.010250851532340436,0.0002597402597402903,0.0002597402597402903,0.0002597402597402903,0.0002597402597402903,0.0002597402597402903,0.32853974568513833,0.0581253899380654,0.0002597402597402903,0.04048211166042933,0.022128285182987494,0.0002597402597402903,0.019516187822395892,0.0002597402597402903,0.0002597402597402903,0.0002597402597402903,0.0002597402597402903,0.0002597402597402903,0.0002597402597402903,0.0002597402597402903,0.04607081761755828,0.05504907283213527,0.0002597402597402903,0.0002597402597402903,0.018634029951591576,0.0002597402597402903,0.0002597402597402903,0.0002597402597402903,0.0002597402597402903,0.1248827343988007,0.0002597402597402903,0.0002597402597402903,0.0002597402597402903,0.0002597402597402903,0.0002597402597402903,0.0002597402597402903,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

37879,0,"Even though this movie came out a year before I was born , it is definetely one of my favorite comedies . It stars Redd Foxx as a father who tries to understand his son 's homosexuality . Like most parents , he does n't know a thing about what it means to be gay and has all of these stereotypical notions of what gay people are like . His son , Norman , is now grown up and living on his own . When his father , Ben , finds out that his son is gay , he pays his son a visit in hopes of changing him . The title comes from one of the funniest lines in the movie -- when Ben gets to Norman 's apartments he runs into a female prostitute and thinks it 's his son in drag ( "" Norman ... Is that you ? "" ) . The movie had me laughing from start to finish . Redd Foxx is great . Although a lot of the content is stereotypical , I did n't find anything offensive about the way the material was handled , and it even has a good ending . Highly recommended .",204,1,0.0005405405405405791,0.0005405405405405791,0.0005405405405405791,0.0005405405405405791,0.0005405405405405791,0.0005405405405405791,0.0005405405405405791,0.0005405405405405791,0.0005405405405405791,0.0005405405405405791,0.0005405405405405791,0.05472107167256267,0.0005405405405405791,0.0005405405405405791,0.0005405405405405791,0.0005405405405405791,0.0005405405405405791,0.0005405405405405791,0.0005405405405405791,0.0005405405405405791,0.5279614412934709,0.0005405405405405791,0.0005405405405405791,0.04159704955198938,0.0005405405405405791,0.0005405405405405791,0.0005405405405405791,0.0005405405405405791,0.0005405405405405791,0.0005405405405405791,0.0005405405405405791,0.0005405405405405791,0.1592064216825472,0.0005405405405405791,0.0005405405405405791,0.0005405405405405791,0.0005405405405405791,0.0005405405405405791,0.0005405405405405791,0.0005405405405405791,0.0005405405405405791,0.1921896914751036,0.0005405405405405791,0.0005405405405405791,0.0005405405405405791,0.0005405405405405791,0.0005405405405405791,0.0005405405405405791,0.0005405405405405791,0.0005405405405405791,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I am in my fifties and have a lot of friends in the music business ... who are now still trying to become adults .... no more fans , groupies , money etc ... and they are having such a hard time adjusting to a regular life ... as they see the new bands etc getting the spotlight ... it is almost like they have to begin anew ... this film is a testament to what a lot of the old rockers from the 70 's and 80 's are going through now .... and that 's where I find the film sad and depressing . BUT it portrays the life of an old rock star - abandoned and lost - in a believable way . The young girl who arrives at his decrepit home reminds me of Hollis maclaren ( Outrageous) ... and she is one lady in a film you will cheer for . This film is a must have for folks in their 50 's who have seen the rise and fall of bands , people who knew the members , and have watched them hurt as age creeps in , and popularity fades . This is an almost perfect movie .... sad but in a way positive .... because of the whales .

Even when you hate a character , you hold back because they are so beautifully developed , you can almost understand why they react to frustration , fear , greed or temptation the way they do . It 's almost as if the viewer is experiencing one of Christopher 's learning curves . I ca n't understand why Adriana would put up with Christopher 's abuse of her , verbally , physically and emotionally , but I just have to read the newspaper to see how many women can and do tolerate such behavior . Carmella has a dream house , endless supply of expensive things , but I 'm sure she would give it up for a loving and faithful husband - or maybe not . That 's why I watch . It does n't matter how many times you watch an episode , you can find something you missed the first five times . We even watch episodes out of sequence ( watch season 1 on late night with commercials but all the language , A&E with language censored , reruns on the Movie Network ) - whenever they 're on , we 're there .

38818,0,"In the trivia section for Pet Sematary , it mentions that George Romero ( director of two Stephen King stories , Creepshow and The Dark Half ) was set to direct and then pulled out . One wonders what he would 've brought to the film , as the director Mary Lambert , while not really a bad director , does n't really bring that much imagination to this adaptation of King 's novel , of which he wrote the screenplay . There are of course some very effective , grotesquely surreal scenes ( mainly involving the sister Zelda , likely more of a creep - out for kids if they see the film ) , and the casting in some of the roles is dead - perfect . But something feels missing at times , some sort of style that could correspond with the unmistakably King - like atmosphere , which is in this case about as morbid as you 're going to get without incestuous cannibals rising from the graves being thrown in ( who knows if he 'll save that for his final novel ... ) As mentioned though , some of the casting is terrific , notably Miko Hughes as Gage Creed , the little boy who goes from being one of the cutest little kids this side of an 80 's horror movie , to being a little monster ( I say that as a compliment , of course , especially in scenes brandishing a certain scalpel ) . And there is also a juicy supporting role for Fred Gwynne of the Munsters , who plays this old , secretive man with the right notes of under - playing and doom in tone . And applause goes to whomever did the make - up on Andrew Hubatsek . But there are some other flaws though in the other casting ; Dale Midkiff is good , not great , as the conflicted , disturbed father figure Creed , and his daughter Ellie is played by an actress that just did n't work for me at all . In terms of setting up some chilling set - pieces , only a couple really stand - out : a certain plot - thickening moment ( not to spoil , it does involve a cool Ramones song ) , and the first visit to the pet sematary ( the bigger one ) , including the sort of mystical overtones King had in the Shining . For the most part it 's a very polished directing job , though it could 've been made even darker to correspond with the script . If thought out in logical terms ( albeit in King terms ) it is really one of his more effective works of the period . But it does n't add up like it could , or should . Still , it makes for a nifty little midnight movie .",491,1,0.00024691358024693977,0.00024691358024693977,0.00024691358024693977,0.00024691358024693977,0.049207507748123915,0.030947421972385453,0.013949111389279603,0.00024691358024693977,0.00024691358024693977,0.00024691358024693977,0.00024691358024693977,0.00024691358024693977,0.07603780786587357,0.00024691358024693977,0.01256114784946742,0.00024691358024693977,0.06739600469719334,0.00024691358024693977,0.00024691358024693977,0.00024691358024693977,0.3651001595971644,0.09335220485254644,0.00024691358024693977,0.00024691358024693977,0.00024691358024693977,0.03403689924424391,0.00024691358024693977,0.00024691358024693977,0.00024691358024693977,0.00024691358024693977,0.00024691358024693977,0.00024691358024693977,0.00024691358024693977,0.00024691358024693977,0.03205193843704403,0.00024691358024693977,0.03737041230753261,0.00024691358024693977,0.00024691358024693977,0.00024691358024693977,0.00024691358024693977,0.033293455872882655,0.00024691358024693977,0.12057139647455056,0.00024691358024693977,0.025235642802822294,0.00024691358024693977,0.00024691358024693977,0.00024691358024693977,0.00024691358024693977,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0

38895,0,"This is without doubt my favourite Le Carre novel and it is transformed to the silver screen with all the love and care one could wish for . I read a review on this site that seems to find the characters loathsome but I believe this misses the point . All Le Carre stories are essentially love stories and this is no exception . It is an accurate reflection of the period in which it is set . Betrayal is the key by everybody for the good of nobody . Pym upbringing is so close to my own that I find it chilling watching . Peter Egan is in his finest role and the late lamented Ray McAnally is unbelievably good . Even the smallest roles played by such as Andy de la Tour , Tim Healy and Jack Ellis are spot on . This cast is a Theatre Impresario 's Dream . The Story should not be spoiled by ill informed description but suffice it to say it relates to a young mans slow but inexorable destruction and descent into espionage and treason . All my sympathies lie with Magnus Pym and his sole ( non sexual ) love for Poppy ( Rüdiger Weigang - as wonderful as always . His only true friendship but also by definition another in the long line of betrayals . OUTSTANDING !

38900,0,"Michael Cacoyannis has had a relatively long career but has surprisingly few credits to his name , including some real duds such as the unfunny cold war satire The Day the Fish Came Out . Iphigenia , however , is a highlight . Adapted by Cacoyannis from the play by Euripides , it 's a superior rendering of the classic tragedy and recently made its first television appearance in many years in the United States courtesy the Flix Channel . The film is shot on an epic scale but is decidedly not a ' big ' film , with the emphasis placed on the simple story : in supplication to the gods , King Agamemnon ( Kostas Kazakos)is compelled to sacrifice his daughter Iphigenia ( Tatiana Papamoschou ) , much to the consternation of Queen Clytemnastrae ( Irene Papas ) . Kazakos and Papas are both outstanding , but it is the stunning Papamoschou who brings the most interesting elements to the screen , blending the innocence of childhood with the dawning realization that she is the pawn in a political game . Strongly recommended for fans of international cinema .",191,1,0.0009090909090909792,0.0009090909090909792,0.0009090909090909792,0.0009090909090909792,0.0009090909090909792,0.0009090909090909792,0.0009090909090909792,0.0009090909090909792,0.08111349934623113,0.0009090909090909792,0.0009090909090909792,0.046363636363636176,0.0009090909090909792,0.0009090909090909792,0.0009090909090909792,0.0009090909090909792,0.0009090909090909792,0.0009090909090909792,0.0009090909090909792,0.0009090909090909792,0.0009090909090909792,0.0009090909090909792,0.0009090909090909792,0.0009090909090909792,0.0009090909090909792,0.0009090909090909792,0.0009090909090909792,0.0009090909090909792,0.0009090909090909792,0.040956205363220956,0.0009090909090909792,0.04636363736281342,0.0009090909090909792,0.0009090909090909792,0.0009090909090909792,0.0009090909090909792,0.0009090909090909792,0.0009090909090909792,0.0009090909090909792,0.0009090909090909792,0.11918325546506463,0.046363636363636246,0.0009090909090909792,0.5059484329522032,0.0009090909090909792,0.0009090909090909792,0.07552587860137315,0.0009090909090909792,0.0009090909090909792,0.0009090909090909792,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1
38994,0,"Pufnstuf is what it is . I saw this in the cinema at age 4 and I have very fond , and vivid , memories of it . Seeing this as as adult allows one to catch the references that are way over the heads of the target audience - like the bit where Jimmy 's grey witch wig is ripped off and Witch Hazel ( Cass ) sneers "" I KNEW she had brown roots ! "" . It is of course heavily influenced by the flower power culture of the time , and in some ways quite progressive . The track Different , for example sends a clear message to the young viewers about being yourself , not running with the pack , and cherishing what is is about yourself that is different . This could be an anthem to the gay community , it should be , great track . Martha Raye , Cass Elliot and Billie Hayes are all great as witches , and the Living Island cast give it their all in the confines of their character suits ( includes Billy Barty , Felix Silla and other famous names ) . There is a LOT of over acting in this film - there 's really nothing subtle , and when little Jack Wild has to emote his concern for the kidnapped residents of Living Island it 's really little more than yelling . This is drama and comedy spread on with a trowel . While I think of it - I never could stand the flute though . I love the soundtrack , especially the above mentioned Different but also Zap The World , Pufnstuf and even Jack Wild 's touching If I Could .

39768,0,"A young solicitor from London , Arthur Kidd is sent to a small coastal town of Crythin Gifford to oversee the estate of a recently passed away widow Mrs Drablow . While attending her funeral , a mysterious lady dressed in black catches his attention . Supposedly Drablow lived a reclusive life , and locals kept pretty quiet about her . After this he heads to Mrs Drablow mansion that can only be reached on a causeway through the swamp during low tide . There he encounters the woman in black again in cemetery out back of the house , and things begin to get creepy as terrifying noises start coming from the marshes . Now can Mrs Drablow 's belongings and listening to her recorded dairy entries help Kidd figure out this gloomy mystery that the locals fear to talk about . Often highly regarded amongst horror fans as being one of the most chilling ghost stories ever and I can see their point . But only in doses does it draw upon tag . Yes , from what you can gather I was left a ' little ' under - whelmed , despite really liking it . I was expecting goose bumps throughout the whole feature , but that 's probably it expecting . Mainly I had a similar reaction with the 1980 haunted house thriller ' The Changeling ' . When you hear so many good things , it 's sometimes hard not get caught up with it . Anyhow what the British TV presentation of "" The Woman in Black "" effectively does is bring out a truly old - fashion , slow burn spine - tingling premise driven by its moody locations , disquieting atmosphere and first - rate performances . Subtly blankets the psychologically gripping story ( adapted off Susan Hill 's novel of the same name ) , as the simple mystery authentically opens up with a depressingly tragic tone and successfully characterises its protagonist . Little seems to happen , and can feel drawn out , but the fragile randomness of it catch you off guard . Whenever the camera focuses on the lady in black . Who mostly appears as a background figure , it 's ultimately creepy . She might not appear all that much , but when she does . Talk about unnerving ! That also goes for that downbeat conclusion . Pauline Moran , who plays the woman in black , competently gets us nervous by just her gaunt appearance and sudden positioning . A pale look and those minor mannerisms just seem to haunt you . She 's a spirit you do n't want to cross paths with , yet alone let her see you . An accomplished performance by a marvelously moody Adrian Rawlins as the solicitor Arthur Kidd does hold it all together . In support are solid turns by Bernard Hepton , David Daker , Clare Holman and David Ryall . Drawing heavy on its lushly sombre rural town and foggy coastal locations adds more to the realistically eerie plight and the centre piece were everything unfolds in the forlorn , time - worn Victorian house that comprehensively suffocates the air with constant fear . Director Herbert Wise carefully fabricates alarming imagery that slowly covers one secretive piece at a time in a smoothly paved out rhythm of well - judged contriving . Instead of going out to shock us , some scenes contain a distressing intensity that wo n't let go . The sound effects are masterfully used , by surrounding and disorienting the air . Rachel Portman 's harrowing musical score knows how to get under your skin during those eerie moments and then stay with you . This rarity made - for - television feat is a stimulating rich and unsettling supernatural spook - fest . It might not share much new to the sub - genre , but it competently sticks to it strengths to deliver what counts in this curse .",672,1,0.00024096385542171636,0.19813501392330696,0.00024096385542171636,0.00024096385542171636,0.00024096385542171636,0.00024096385542171636,0.0124201228531718,0.00024096385542171636,0.00024096385542171636,0.00024096385542171636,0.00024096385542171636,0.014173957588125228,0.00024096385542171636,0.00024096385542171636,0.02209900816741331,0.00024096385542171636,0.1334150206844705,0.00024096385542171636,0.00024096385542171636,0.06964281248531295,0.00024096385542171636,0.00024096385542171636,0.016750819578106334,0.019120177191933152,0.05710768081051842,0.00024096385542171636,0.00024096385542171636,0.00024096385542171636,0.013583490679514629,0.00024096385542171636,0.00024096385542171636,0.00024096385542171636,0.054562753500282064,0.00024096385542171636,0.00024096385542171636,0.14691549627490474,0.019688090237676113,0.00024096385542171636,0.00024096385542171636,0.00024096385542171636,0.00024096385542171636,0.00024096385542171636,0.00024096385542171636,0.21371085723008226,0.00024096385542171636,0.00024096385542171636,0.00024096385542171636,0.00024096385542171636,0.00024096385542171636,0.00024096385542171636,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
39789,0,"This film is exactly what its title describes -- an attempt to get you to buy into what the writers have to offer . First , it 's kinda fun to see the 1996-style Toronto I remember with all its silly haircuts , sunglasses , clothes , and attitude . It really has n't changed any ; just a nice , safe , cheap , provincial little urban backwater that makes a great meeting place for international film types ! It 's also amusing to see Kenny and Spenny head to L.A. and find out that it 's Toronto all over again , only with a strange assortment of beach bums , musicians , fortune tellers , and yet more uppity film types . I do n't see Pitch as a film to be enjoyed ; it 's not entertainment unless the viewer enjoys watching someone 's aspirations being trampled .

39942,0,"In NYC , seaman Michael O'Hara ( Orson Welles ) rescues Elsa Bannister ( Rita Hayworth ) from a mugging & rape as she takes a horse & carriage through Central Park -and lives to regret it . Titian - haired Hayworth 's a platinum blonde in this one ; as dazzling as fresh - fallen snow -but nowhere near as pure ... To reveal any more of the convoluted plot in this seminal "" noir "" would be criminal . It 's as deceptive as the mirrors used to cataclysmic effect in the final scenes -but the film holds far darker secrets : From the NY Times : "" Childhood Shadows : The Hidden Story Of The Black Dahlia Murder "" by Mary Pacios "" Mary Pacios , who was 5 years old when she was befriended by 15 year old Bette Short , retraces Short 's steps , interviewing friends and associates . She also offered a detailed , if speculative , analysis of Orson Welles -particularly in regard to his movie "" The Lady From Shanghai "" . According to Ms. Pacios , the movie , along with related archival materials , has many of the same ritualistic elements associated with Short 's murder . She raises the question : Could Welles have been the killer ? "" Interesting theories -and with the spate of books now out on "" The Black Dahlia "" , much more may come to light . Fritz Lang 's brutal "" film noir "" , "" The Big Heat "" ( 1953 ) , was a roman - a - clef telling of the "" Dahlia "" killing in "" The City Of Nets "" that was L.A. -but it 's the Orson opus that the "" Dahlia "" had a "" hands - on "" connection to . In reality , it was Bugsy Siegel ( and the Hollywood mob wars of the 1940 's ) that did the "" Dahlia "" in ... but that does n't negate much of what Pacios wrote . Almost all of Hollywood intersected with Elizabeth ( "" The Black Dahlia "" ) Short and her tale / aura / legacy / curse is encoded in a number of Golden Age films . The "" Black Dahlia "" was always on the peripheral edges of "" Shanghai""-even before it started filming . Barbara Payton on Franchot Tone : "" It was when he was thinking about making "" The Lady From Shanghai "" , before he lost the option to Orson Welles . Franchot said he 'd been in a bad state over that deal when he ran into the Dahlia in the Formosa Cafe * across from the Goldwyn studios ... "" * The floor above the Formosa Cafe was Bugsy Siegel 's office and "" The Dahlia "" one of his on again / off again working "" girls"" . It gets deeper and darker- After the 1951 brawl over Barbara Payton between Tom Neal and Franchot Tone that sent Franchot to the hospital with a concussion and "" never talking the same way again , "" Barbara said , she married Tone "" just to spite Neal . "" Tom ( "" Detour "" ) Neal also knew "" The Dahlia "" ( who did n't ? ) and became obsessed- From "" L.A. Despair "" by John Gilmore : "" The January 1947 slaying of the young , beautiful would - be actress Elizabeth Short , known as "" The Black Dahlia "" , was one of the most grisly murders in the annals of modern crime . A project , called "" Who Killed The Black Dahlia ? "" was being kicked off by actor Tom Neal , a hell - raiser from WW II movies . Potential producer Gene Harris : "" Someone will have to come up with a more imaginative business proposition than what has been presented by Tom Neal and his cohorts ... "" Not long after : "" It would be very clear one beautiful day to come , when Tom would sneak up on his pretty , new Palm Springs wife as she lay on their sofa and shoot a .45 bullet through her head . "" Barbara Payton and Norma Jean Dougherty ( later Marilyn Monroe ) knew the "" Dahlia "" and their stories are well known . It seems all who crossed the path of the "" Dahlia "" ( like the proverbial black cat ) entered a "" Twilight Zone "" darkness and/or had an incredible string of bad luck afterward . Tone / Neal / Welles are only a few -and this includes a butchered film called "" The Lady From Shanghai"" ... ""Lady From Shanghai "" took two years to be released , thanks to extensive re - editing -and all because Columbia president Harry Cohn could n't understand the story . It 's dark "" noir "" to be sure -one of the darkest , in fact . It 's also a wicked satire on life in the new Atomic Age . Nicolas Christopher:""Shanghai "" pushes forth an insistent subtext of nuclear apocalypse and contains the definitive noir statement concerning the atomic bomb and the American city . The film 's principal murder victim ( and there are many ) , a psychotic and double - dealing lawyer , manically foresees Armageddon at every turn , claiming he can "" feel it . "" He announces that he plans to escape to a remote Pacific island -a particularly acid joke on Welles ' part since this was the very year the U.S. began testing atomic bombs at just such a place , the Bikini Atoll , relocating all the inhabitants and destroying the ecosystem . By the time of Bikini , the erotic identification of Hayworth with the Bomb appears to have been institutionalized , with the blessing of the military brass ; the first bomb dropped in the Pacific testing ground in named "" Gilda "" and has Hayworth 's image , in provocative dress , painted directly on its casing ... "" Its ironic that Orson Welles ' broad interpretation of an Irishman is considered a detriment to the film by many . Welles is giving a clue to viewers that "" Michael O'Hara "" is only the storyteller - not part of the story even though it revolves around him . "" O'Hara "" contradicts the shark motif throughout the film . Sharks on a feeding frenzy wo n't stop until there 's nothing left . "" Michael O'Hara "" lives to tell the tale . "" Elsa Bannister "" causes a feeding frenzy during "" O'Hara 's "" trial and her netted chapeau suggests she 's caged in -so as not to devour the human spectators to a Roman Coleseum . The spectators are on a feeding frenzy of their own , gossiping and carrying on about "" Elsa "" -a human aquarium correlating to the San Francisco marine museum sequence . That 's the human condition ... except for "" Michael O'Hara "" . And yet he 'll be spending his life trying to forget his past ( "" Elsa "" ) -or die trying . "" Elsa "" is part of "" Michael "" and the tale eats its own tail in the end and the viewer is cautioned to stay out of trouble .",1245,1,0.00016528925619836626,0.030458798498528287,0.00016528925619836626,0.00016528925619836626,0.00016528925619836626,0.00016528925619836626,0.00016528925619836626,0.16138897919632583,0.014962783318899314,0.00016528925619836626,0.00016528925619836626,0.00016528925619836626,0.09938358817410566,0.00016528925619836626,0.00016528925619836626,0.00016528925619836626,0.00016528925619836626,0.00016528925619836626,0.00016528925619836626,0.00016528925619836626,0.10165370514856902,0.00016528925619836626,0.00016528925619836626,0.01566390328141717,0.00016528925619836626,0.00016528925619836626,0.02791829465227602,0.00016528925619836626,0.00016528925619836626,0.017569689807929847,0.00016528925619836626,0.00898375715662364,0.00016528925619836626,0.00016528925619836626,0.05346997285613951,0.059166551586029875,0.012449008296693882,0.00016528925619836626,0.00016528925619836626,0.00016528925619836626,0.03689249253261676,0.00016528925619836626,0.00016528925619836626,0.28975780321601935,0.00016528925619836626,0.06449554831088311,0.00016528925619836626,0.00016528925619836626,0.00016528925619836626,0.00016528925619836626,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0

The story , about a pair of social outcasts who meet , become friends , and provide each other with a support system both seemed to lack as children , is at times hilarious , at times sad , but always provocative .

39984,0,""" The Incredible Melting Man "" is a fantastically gross , trashy and energetic Z - grade production that every self - respecting camp - horror freak simply has to see for him / herself ! The ideal way to describe this low - budget 70 's gem is like a shameless copy of Hammer 's "" The Quatermass Xperiment "" ... only a thousand times filthier ! Astronaust Steve West is the only survivor of a disastrous space - mission , but turns out the carrier of a horrible disease that makes him radioactive and ... causes him to melt ! In shock after seeing his face in the mirror ( can you blame him ? ) , Steve busts out of the hospital , leaving a trail of sticky pus and fallen off body parts behind . Doctor Ted Nelson has to find him urgently , as the disease also set Steve up with an insatiable appetite for human flesh . The premise may sound utterly stupid but this flick is enormously entertaining and contains great make - up effects from the hand of Rick Baker . The melting dude 's face looks like a rotting pizza and his heavy breathing makes him sound like Darth Vader ! Another big advantage is that William Sachs ' screenplay does n't waste any time on tedious scientific explanations or emotional speeches . The repulsiveness starts right away and lasts until the very last moment of the film .

Irons deserved an award for his performance and Close was never better .",121,1,0.0007407407407408002,0.0007407407407408002,0.0007407407407408002,0.0007407407407408002,0.0007407407407408002,0.03627029960538452,0.0007407407407408002,0.0007407407407408002,0.0007407407407408002,0.0007407407407408002,0.0007407407407408002,0.0007407407407408002,0.0007407407407408002,0.0007407407407408002,0.0007407407407408002,0.0007407407407408002,0.0007407407407408002,0.0007407407407408002,0.0007407407407408002,0.0007407407407408002,0.3489916730100237,0.1880995467015106,0.0007407407407408002,0.0007407407407408002,0.0007407407407408002,0.0007407407407408002,0.0007407407407408002,0.0007407407407408002,0.0007407407407408002,0.0007407407407408002,0.0007407407407408002,0.03777777777777868,0.0007407407407408002,0.0007407407407408002,0.0007407407407408002,0.0007407407407408002,0.1251103179018662,0.0007407407407408002,0.0007407407407408002,0.0007407407407408002,0.0007407407407408002,0.03921445777161095,0.0007407407407408002,0.19268407537997112,0.0007407407407408002,0.0007407407407408002,0.0007407407407408002,0.0007407407407408002,0.0007407407407408002,0.0007407407407408002,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
40268,0,"This movie was very good . If you are one who likes to watch horror movies , I recommend it . The acting was very good although I thought that the actress playing Julie could have had more emotion behind her lines . Allan was very good and I thought the cinematography was amazing . I was on the edge of my seat the entire time while my friends were freaking out and screaming . It was a complete success in my opinion and should have made it to the big screen . I give it two thumbs up ! I definitely would say that if you have n't already seen it then go rent it . If you have seen it and did n't like it go and watch it again because there are parts that were completely unreal . I also liked how a lot of the movie was filmed around and on my school 's campus .",160,1,0.0005882352941176903,0.0005882352941176903,0.0005882352941176903,0.0005882352941176903,0.0005882352941176903,0.0005882352941176903,0.03154548658828646,0.0005882352941176903,0.028155880086516923,0.0005882352941176903,0.0005882352941176903,0.0005882352941176903,0.0005882352941176903,0.0005882352941176903,0.0005882352941176903,0.0005882352941176903,0.0005882352941176903,0.0005882352941176903,0.0005882352941176903,0.0005882352941176903,0.504577246770938,0.4086625630248449,0.0005882352941176903,0.0005882352941176903,0.0005882352941176903,0.0005882352941176903,0.0005882352941176903,0.0005882352941176903,0.0005882352941176903,0.0005882352941176903,0.0005882352941176903,0.0005882352941176903,0.0005882352941176903,0.0005882352941176903,0.0005882352941176903,0.0005882352941176903,0.0005882352941176903,0.0005882352941176903,0.0005882352941176903,0.0005882352941176903,0.0005882352941176903,0.0005882352941176903,0.0005882352941176903,0.0005882352941176903,0.0005882352941176903,0.0005882352941176903,0.0005882352941176903,0.0005882352941176903,0.0005882352941176903,0.0005882352941176903,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Sagal makes a return to being the female lead in a sit - com , and her character is far removed from Peggy Bundy .

One can wonder how or why it lasted for so long after that : It could still be quite good , some of the additions were fortunate(if you like David Spade , most of his part consists of him doing his schtick ) and had stuff to say . My personal favorite episode is in the last season . The humor is a nice mix of "" dumb person "" jokes(mainly related to the high - schoolers ) , silliness , dark comedy and crude material . This dealt with sex and other adult topics , but never in a graphic manner . The language is mild , and , on occasion , moderately strong . I recommend this to any fan of those who made it . 8/10",327,1,0.11643128718283405,0.00036363636363640677,0.00036363636363640677,0.01583972689441611,0.00036363636363640677,0.00036363636363640677,0.00036363636363640677,0.00036363636363640677,0.04574156987181335,0.00036363636363640677,0.00036363636363640677,0.01344923598424272,0.00036363636363640677,0.00036363636363640677,0.00036363636363640677,0.00036363636363640677,0.00036363636363640677,0.00036363636363640677,0.00036363636363640677,0.00036363636363640677,0.3229544307197741,0.00036363636363640677,0.00036363636363640677,0.00036363636363640677,0.00036363636363640677,0.00036363636363640677,0.026256901798862774,0.00036363636363640677,0.00036363636363640677,0.00036363636363640677,0.00036363636363640677,0.018849849445877587,0.13318538281414893,0.00036363636363640677,0.00036363636363640677,0.058614189013230296,0.06071204124480822,0.03787108446396783,0.00036363636363640677,0.00036363636363640677,0.00036363636363640677,0.04969222873963387,0.00036363636363640677,0.00036363636363640677,0.053171707905908305,0.034139454829571265,0.00036363636363640677,0.00036363636363640677,0.00036363636363640677,0.00036363636363640677,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0

He 's a great fighter and macho - like character , and was a good rival for Wincott in this movie .",166,1,0.0006060606060606436,0.0006060606060606436,0.0006060606060606436,0.0006060606060606436,0.11428721524802331,0.0006060606060606436,0.0006060606060606436,0.0006060606060606436,0.0006060606060606436,0.0006060606060606436,0.0006060606060606436,0.0006060606060606436,0.0006060606060606436,0.0006060606060606436,0.0006060606060606436,0.0006060606060606436,0.17356884216395901,0.0006060606060606436,0.0006060606060606436,0.0006060606060606436,0.3825421028413476,0.26654649000642944,0.0006060606060606436,0.0006060606060606436,0.0006060606060606436,0.0006060606060606436,0.0006060606060606436,0.0006060606060606436,0.0006060606060606436,0.0006060606060606436,0.0006060606060606436,0.0006060606060606436,0.0006060606060606436,0.0006060606060606436,0.0006060606060606436,0.0006060606060606436,0.0006060606060606436,0.0006060606060606436,0.03578262246751167,0.0006060606060606436,0.0006060606060606436,0.0006060606060606436,0.0006060606060606436,0.0006060606060606436,0.0006060606060606436,0.0006060606060606436,0.0006060606060606436,0.0006060606060606436,0.0006060606060606436,0.0006060606060606436,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

They are fun , energetic , and very entertaining . They encourage children to be active , share and care . They always have a positive message along with fun entertainment . Every time our son hears the theme song he quickly turns his head toward the television and starts bouncing up and down in excitement . Dee Dee is a wonderful singer , she has a great voice . Moe is a great dancer . I would recommend The DoodleBops to anyone with children . Our favorite song is The Bird Song .

41917,0,""" In Cold Blood "" , adapted by director Richard Brooks from Truman Capote 's famous novel , deals with the brutal and senseless murder of a family of four by a pair of hapless criminals . The film excels as a character study of the killers , particularly trigger - man Perry Smith ( Robert Blake).The cast includes few recognizable names but they nevertheless bring the story to life with ease . Robert Blake and Scott Wilson are excellent together as two criminals with disparate personalities . They play off of each other effortlessly while Blake also gets plenty of opportunities to explore his character 's idiosyncrasies . The rest of the cast is merely average and is n't worth remarking on . Richard Brooks received Oscar nominations for both his script and his direction . In my opinion , both were excellent , though the script does miscalculate with some ill - advised narration in the late stages . The Oscar - nominated cinematography by Conrad Hall is also top - notch , as is the editing . Also worthy of note is the jazzy score by Quincy Jones which secured the last of the film 's four Oscar nominations . Unlike so many other crime films , this one does n't glamorize violence . Brooks turns the killers into pitiable characters rather than flatly condemning them . Whether or not you agree with that sentiment the film does present an interesting alternative to the usual Hollywood approach . I recommend the film for this reason and also for the expertise with which the technical aspects are handled .",271,1,0.0005555555555556114,0.0005555555555556114,0.0005555555555556114,0.0005555555555556114,0.0005555555555556114,0.0005555555555556114,0.0005555555555556114,0.08576641357077375,0.026971021872837196,0.0005555555555556114,0.0005555555555556114,0.05539916071946307,0.0005555555555556114,0.0005555555555556114,0.0005555555555556114,0.0005555555555556114,0.0005555555555556114,0.0005555555555556114,0.0005555555555556114,0.0005555555555556114,0.14604980506985638,0.0005555555555556114,0.0005555555555556114,0.0005555555555556114,0.0005555555555556114,0.0005555555555556114,0.0005555555555556114,0.0005555555555556114,0.0005555555555556114,0.0005555555555556114,0.0005555555555556114,0.0005555555555556114,0.0005555555555556114,0.0005555555555556114,0.03217792091664472,0.0005555555555556114,0.04050869699037397,0.0005555555555556114,0.09374939721456474,0.0005555555555556114,0.0005555555555556114,0.0005555555555556114,0.0005555555555556114,0.49604425031215044,0.0005555555555556114,0.0005555555555556114,0.0005555555555556114,0.0005555555555556114,0.0005555555555556114,0.0005555555555556114,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
41944,0,"I watch most movies that Nick Mancuso is in because , frankly , I love the guy , even though as he ages he is typically cast as the baddie ( long - time fans should note that he is for some reason blond in this flick ) . It 's a fairly familiar movie in terms of plot ( but then most movies these days are n't exactly original ) , but Rick Roberts is appealing as the imperfect husband , Martha MacIsaac is equally appealing as the daughter , and Mitzi Kapture does a good job , if that was her goal , of being angry and sometimes pretty hard to like . Nick has still got it in terms of being able to demonstrate both charm and psychosis . However , too much of the plot takes place off - screen -- like motivation , prior behaviors , good times and bad times -- and things that seem apparent to the characters never quite make it to the audience ( i.e. , me ) . The final scene leaves everything to be desired in the "" but what about ... "" category , and overall , I ca n't say that I cared much about any of the characters . That being said , it was what it was -- a reasonably entertaining way to spend the afternoon -- and I still like Nick .",238,1,0.00040000000000003217,0.00040000000000003217,0.00040000000000003217,0.00040000000000003217,0.00040000000000003217,0.00040000000000003217,0.00040000000000003217,0.00040000000000003217,0.00040000000000003217,0.00040000000000003217,0.00040000000000003217,0.00040000000000003217,0.00040000000000003217,0.00040000000000003217,0.00040000000000003217,0.00040000000000003217,0.10855400024909659,0.00040000000000003217,0.00040000000000003217,0.00040000000000003217,0.35981059174604463,0.11849344239525789,0.00040000000000003217,0.00040000000000003217,0.00040000000000003217,0.00040000000000003217,0.00040000000000003217,0.00040000000000003217,0.00040000000000003217,0.00040000000000003217,0.00040000000000003217,0.00040000000000003217,0.00040000000000003217,0.00040000000000003217,0.00040000000000003217,0.00040000000000003217,0.00040000000000003217,0.00040000000000003217,0.00040000000000003217,0.00040000000000003217,0.00040000000000003217,0.03646648112274483,0.00040000000000003217,0.3586754844868546,0.00040000000000003217,0.00040000000000003217,0.00040000000000003217,0.00040000000000003217,0.00040000000000003217,0.00040000000000003217,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

42254,0,"It could have been a better film . It does drag at points , and the central story shifts from Boyer completing his mission to Boyer avenging Wanda Hendrix 's death , but Graham Greene is an author who is really hard to spoil . His stories are all morality tales , due to his own considerations of Catholicism , guilt and innocence ( very relative terms in his world view ) , and the human condition . Boyer is Luis Denard , a well - known concert pianist , who has sided with the Republicans in the Spanish Civil War . He has been sent to England to try to carry through an arms purchase deal that is desperately needed . Unfortunately for Denard he is literally on his own - everyone of his contacts turns out to be a willing turncoat for the Falagists of Spain . In particular Katina Paxinou ( Mrs. Melendez ) a grim boarding house keeper , and Peter Lorre ( Mr. Contreras ) a teacher of an "" esperanto "" type international language . Wanda Hendrix is the drudge of a girl ( Else ) who works for Mrs. Melendez . The local diplomat , Licata ( Victor Francken ) is already a willing associate of the Falangists . The Brits ( Holmes Herbert , Miles Mander , and best - if not worst - of the lot , George Coulouris ) do n't give much hope to Boyer 's cause ( which he soon grasps may be Britain 's before long ) . Herbert and Mander just retreat behind the official policy of neutrality ordered by the Ramsay MacDonald 's and Stanley Baldwin 's governments during the Civil War . Coulouris here is a typical Col . Blimp type - always impeccable in his native English diction , he is sharp in showing his dislike for foreigners in general . The one ray of hope is Lauren Bacall ( Rose Cullen ) , here trying to play her role as well as she can - but she ca n't really . She 's an aristocrat - the daughter of a Press lord . It was Bacall 's second film , and ( sad to say ) almost sank her long career . She does act well , but the spark she showed in her first film was due to the dual effect of starring with Humphrey Bogart and being directed by Howard Hawks . Boyer is a fine actor , but he 's not Bogie , and Herman Shumlin is not Hawks . Her next film returned her to Bogie and Hawks again , and her star resumed it 's ascendancy . It 's a bleak film ( as was the novel ) . Boyer 's mission never succeeds , as he has too many hidden foes all over the place . But the villains are likewise also losers - frequently with their lives . With Dan Seymour as a suspicious foreign tenant of Katina Paxinou ( and the man who destroys her ) . It is well worth watching to catch the Warner 's lot of character actors doing their best given the weakness in direction .",536,1,0.00029850746268659704,0.00029850746268659704,0.00029850746268659704,0.07075093694897262,0.0684893032120498,0.00029850746268659704,0.00029850746268659704,0.21573360145311182,0.024355563819457533,0.00029850746268659704,0.00029850746268659704,0.00029850746268659704,0.00029850746268659704,0.00029850746268659704,0.00029850746268659704,0.00029850746268659704,0.00029850746268659704,0.00029850746268659704,0.00029850746268659704,0.02553607353497464,0.00029850746268659704,0.00029850746268659704,0.00029850746268659704,0.00029850746268659704,0.06504732657751953,0.00029850746268659704,0.00029850746268659704,0.00029850746268659704,0.00029850746268659704,0.00029850746268659704,0.00029850746268659704,0.048572949148033395,0.00029850746268659704,0.00029850746268659704,0.00029850746268659704,0.00029850746268659704,0.07834155042421967,0.03031451169760319,0.02909620122539799,0.00029850746268659704,0.00029850746268659704,0.015647059529937144,0.00029850746268659704,0.3167716388466322,0.00029850746268659704,0.00029850746268659704,0.00029850746268659704,0.00029850746268659704,0.00029850746268659704,0.00029850746268659704,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

The blurb I wrote for Amazon is below , and I 'm just thrilled that it 's finally coming out on DVD on 10/17/06 - the film 's 25th anniversary . The last credit in this film explains its appeal - "" Thank you to the people of Manhattan on whose island this was filmed . "" A charming and witty romantic comedy , it is a love story written to New Yorkers ( Peter Bogdanovich is a native ) who can identify every location ( West 12th Street , the Ansonia , the old FAO Schwartz , the Plaza , the Roxy , Chez Brigitte , and City Limits which was a country & western club ) . One gets the impression that the entire ensemble cast clicked as well off - screen as they do on , and this intimacy is clearly communicated . I laughed , I cried , it was better than CATS .

42269,0,"It is noteworthy that mine is only the third review of this film , whereas ` Patton- Lust for Glory ' , producer Frank McCarthy 's earlier biography of a controversial American general from the Second World War , has to date attracted nearly a hundred comments . Like a previous reviewer , I am intrigued by why one film should have received so much more attention than the other . One difference between the two films is that ` Patton ' is more focused , concentrating on a relatively short period at and immediately after the end of the Second World War , whereas ` MacArthur ' covers not only this war but also its subject 's role in the Korean war , as well as his period as American governor of occupied Japan during the interlude . The main difference , however , lies in the way the two leaders are played . Gregory Peck dominates this film even more than George C. Scott dominated ` Patton ' . Whereas Scott had another major star , Karl Malden , playing opposite him as General Bradley , none of the other actors in ` MacArthur ' are household names , at least for their film work . Scott , of course , portrayed Patton as aggressive and fiery - tempered , a man who at times was at war with the rest of the human race , not just with the enemy . I suspect that in real life General MacArthur was as volcanic an individual as Patton , but that is not how he appears in this film . Peck 's MacArthur is of a more reflective , thoughtful bent , comparable to the liberal intellectuals he played in some of his other films . At times , he even seems to be a man of the political left . Much of his speech on the occasion of the Japanese surrender in 1945 could have been written by a paid - up member of CND , and his policies for reforming Japanese society during the American occupation have a semi - socialist air to them . In an attempt to show something of MacArthur 's gift for inspiring leadership , Peck makes him a fine speaker , but his speeches always seem to owe more to the studied tricks of the practised rhetorician than to any fire in the heart . It is as if Atticus Finch from ` To Kill a Mockingbird ' had put on a general 's uniform . Whereas Scott attempted a ` warts and all ' portrait of Patton , the criticism has been made that ` MacArthur ' attempts to gloss over some of its subject 's less attractive qualities . I think that this criticism is a fair one , particularly as far as the Korean War is concerned . The film gives the impression that MacArthur was a brilliant general who dared stand up to interfering , militarily ignorant politicians who did not know how to fight the war and was sacked for his pains when victory was within his grasp . Many historians , of course , feel that Truman was forced to sack MacArthur because the latter 's conduct was becoming a risk to world peace , and had no choice but to accept a stalemate because Stalin would not have allowed his Chinese allies to be humiliated . Even during the Korean scenes , Peck 's MacArthur comes across as more idealistic than his real - life original probably was ; we see little of his rashness and naivety about political matters . ( Truman 's remark ` he knows as much about politics as a pig knows about Sunday ' was said about Eisenhower , but it could equally well have been applied to MacArthur 's approach to international diplomacy ) . Perhaps the film 's attempt to paint out some of MacArthur 's warts reflects the period in which it was made . The late seventies , after the twin traumas of Vietnam and Watergate , was a difficult time for America , and a public looking for reassurance might have welcomed a reassuringly heroic depiction of a military figure from the previous generation . Another criticism I would make of the film is that it falls between two stools . If it was intended to be a full biography of MacArthur , something should have been shown of his early life , which is not covered at all . ( The first we see of the general is when he is leading the American resistance to the Japanese invasion of the Philippines ) . One theme that runs throughout the film is the influence of General MacArthur 's father , himself a military hero . I would have liked to see what sort of man Arthur MacArthur was , and just why his son considered him to be such a hero and role model . Another interesting way of making the film would have been to concentrate on Korea and on MacArthur 's clash with Truman , with equal prominence given to the two men and with actors of similar stature playing them . The way in which the film actually was made seemed to me to be less interesting than either of these alternative approaches . It would be wrong , however , to give the impression that I disliked the film altogether . Although I may not have agreed with Peck 's interpretation of the main role , there is no denying that he played it with his normal professionalism and seriousness . The film as a whole is a good example of a solid , workmanlike biopic , thoughtful and informative . It is a good film , but one that could have been a better one . 7/10.On a pedantic note , the map which MacArthur is shown using during the Korean War shows the DMZ , the boundary between the two Korean states that did not come into existence until after the war . ( The pre - war boundary was the 38th parallel ) . Also , I think that MacArthur was referring to the ` tocsin ' of war . War may be toxic , but it is difficult to listen with thirsty ear for a toxin .",1061,1,0.0001587301587301719,0.0001587301587301719,0.0001587301587301719,0.018152858336544158,0.0001587301587301719,0.0001587301587301719,0.0001587301587301719,0.2171115420294417,0.0001587301587301719,0.0001587301587301719,0.0001587301587301719,0.008535610074464302,0.0001587301587301719,0.0001587301587301719,0.0001587301587301719,0.0001587301587301719,0.0001587301587301719,0.0001587301587301719,0.0001587301587301719,0.0001587301587301719,0.0001587301587301719,0.041560277948018906,0.0001587301587301719,0.0001587301587301719,0.0001587301587301719,0.0001587301587301719,0.0001587301587301719,0.0001587301587301719,0.0001587301587301719,0.0001587301587301719,0.0001587301587301719,0.12949349513604497,0.0001587301587301719,0.0001587301587301719,0.0001587301587301719,0.0001587301587301719,0.0001587301587301719,0.0001587301587301719,0.02485050248809795,0.0001587301587301719,0.036265430323713994,0.021636710897346326,0.0001587301587301719,0.4619824216712985,0.02309606946211699,0.0001587301587301719,0.011124605442435619,0.0001587301587301719,0.0001587301587301719,0.0001587301587301719,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0

42465,0,"Nine out of ten might seem like a high mark to give for a straight to video sci - fi movie that 's been vilified at the US box office and roundly criticized as the poorest movie of Kurt Russell 's career . I have my reasons . Firstly when you read negative reviews of this film , they usually start with the wooden nature of Russell 's interpretation of Todd , the eponymous Soldier . I 'm going to start here too , with my surprising statement that this is possibly the finest piece of acting I 've seen Russell pull off . Todd is an emotional cripple and suffering from intense PTSD - this movie being written before the phenomenon was as widely recognized as it is now . The portrayal is spot on . Todd is withdrawn , uncommunicative and a loner . He suffers from irrational anxiety - keyed to a fever pitch by training that teaches him to analyze every movement and interaction with another human being for signs of betrayal and danger . His hyper - focus brings with it an inability to comprehend the bigger continuum that the tasks he is given to do sit within - there is a scene where he cuts himself slicing carrots and continues to work unfazed , not cleaning up the cut or the blood . Many interpret this as a sign of his physical toughness and focus on the job at hand , but it is also a sign that he is simply performing the requested task by rote - not comprehending the relationship between the vegetables he 's preparing and the food that will be eaten later . Todd 's dialog is spartan to say the least - the two big talking scenes he gets are central to the plot of the movie and both underline the bleak nature of his existence . Fear and Discipline we are told . Always . Fear to keep him pumped up to a hyper alert state where the smallest detail will not pass him by , keeping him ready to react on a knife edge . Discipline to hold him in check through his fear , to overcome it and perform tactically . The inference is that he has no time to think and can not afford feelings . Many viewers have different interpretations of his reaction to the hug from Nielsen 's Sandra - but I believe you have to interpret it from the perspective of a human who 's only experience of an embrace is in combat - the trembling represents him suppressing his fight / flight instincts reacting to the fear of being grappled , his movement and vision restricted - Fear and Discipline indeed . Then there is the subtext of his abandonment ( Twice in fact ) - so representative of the way our society tends to toss infantrymen onto the rubbish heap of society when they 've served their terms . 40 % of the unemployed are ex - military in OUR world , in HIS it can only be worse . Russell quickly picks up the mantle of Mace 's responsibility to his wife and child - desperately in need of a mission , even one with such a high likelihood of his death . Then there is the military subtext too - the conflict between Busey 's Church and the hotshot from HQ , Mekum . Mekum 's new men are faster , stronger , more accurate and aggressive . Any one of them could pound Todd into the ground - but it 's not about the tools you have it 's how you use them . An incentivized Todd given the freedom to exercise his initiative and acting without the numbing effect of perceived superiority utilizes ambush tactics and sneaky tricks to cut a swathe through the newer unit - sent in without support , cover or reconnaissance . It is a reminder that military power can not make up for a failure in leadership . There are many other subtle themes . When a film is shot and scripted so minimally , it leaves plenty of white space for your own interpretations to take root . Watch Soldier with an open mind and see what it teaches YOU .",721,1,0.08791764828392692,0.00027027027027030145,0.00027027027027030145,0.00027027027027030145,0.014919566253643065,0.00027027027027030145,0.00027027027027030145,0.12186248061959931,0.00027027027027030145,0.00027027027027030145,0.031545648949346444,0.00027027027027030145,0.10618505683937329,0.00027027027027030145,0.008450992923697425,0.00027027027027030145,0.06862920277375176,0.00027027027027030145,0.00027027027027030145,0.00027027027027030145,0.2151241694786004,0.00027027027027030145,0.03552156368100734,0.00027027027027030145,0.00027027027027030145,0.041710585687069986,0.04831996609737552,0.00027027027027030145,0.00027027027027030145,0.00027027027027030145,0.00027027027027030145,0.00027027027027030145,0.00027027027027030145,0.00027027027027030145,0.00027027027027030145,0.01451109815798776,0.00027027027027030145,0.00027027027027030145,0.00027027027027030145,0.00027027027027030145,0.00027027027027030145,0.0324031931901885,0.00027027027027030145,0.12077944129638228,0.00027027027027030145,0.042659926308589655,0.00027027027027030145,0.00027027027027030145,0.00027027027027030145,0.00027027027027030145,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0
42515,0,"Ordinarily I really enjoy movies like "" Chances Are , "" but I was n't quite satisfied with this one for a few reasons . The first half was pretty well done overall , with Alex Finch dying and being reincarnated in a new body ( played by Robert Downey Jr. ) . He meets up with his wife ( Cybill Shepherd ) and friend ( Ryan O'Neal ) and his daughter , who is now grown up . The scenes with them meeting again and Downey rediscovering who he once was are well done , and there is a good amount of emotion and happiness once Shepherd finally believes its really her husband reincarnated , but from there the film goes downhill . There are several sex - related scenes that turned me off completely , especially Downey and Shepherd wanting to get together again despite the difference in their age now . After that , however , the film manages to end in the most satisfying way possible , considering the circumstances of the plot . I was disappointed because I did not expect the film to become so immoral by the end . There was great potential with this story , and the scenes in heaven are well done . There is a good theme song sung by Peter Cetera and Cher , but ultimately the film is not great . For a better , similar film , try "" Heaven Can Wait .

43195,0,"The lovely Danish actress Sonja Richter steals this film from under the noses of everyone , no small feat considering the terrific performances surrounding her . Richter plays Anna , an out - of - work , independent - minded , somewhat neurotic ( and perhaps suicidal ) actress who lands a desperation job looking after a wheelchair - bound , muted , aged father named Walentin ( the great Danish actor Frits Helmuth , who died at 77 shortly after this film was made).SPOILER ALERTWalentin refuses to respond to anyone --until he confronts the gifted Anna , whose whimsical and mischievous manner brings the poor old battered devil back from a self - imposed death sentence . Writer / director / actor Eric Clausen has made a strong film about the difficulty a ponderous businessman son ( Jorgen , played by Clausen ) has loving a father who has never accepted him . The film sags toward the end , but Clausen has some important things to say about euthanasia , the nature and value of loving and caring , and how one person , the irrepressible Anna , can alter the course of a human life . Highly recommended . Sonja Richter 's performance is alone worth the price of admission .",214,1,0.0005128205128205586,0.0005128205128205586,0.03535690676041371,0.0005128205128205586,0.04790313023749551,0.0005128205128205586,0.0005128205128205586,0.19758390508400323,0.0005128205128205586,0.0005128205128205586,0.0005128205128205586,0.05181408158825821,0.0005128205128205586,0.0005128205128205586,0.0005128205128205586,0.0005128205128205586,0.0005128205128205586,0.0005128205128205586,0.0005128205128205586,0.0005128205128205586,0.0005128205128205586,0.0005128205128205586,0.0005128205128205586,0.0005128205128205586,0.032322152801238714,0.0005128205128205586,0.0005128205128205586,0.0005128205128205586,0.0005128205128205586,0.0005128205128205586,0.0005128205128205586,0.0005128205128205586,0.0005128205128205586,0.0005128205128205586,0.047998155916964304,0.0005128205128205586,0.0005128205128205586,0.0005128205128205586,0.0005128205128205586,0.0005128205128205586,0.0005128205128205586,0.14064623893471087,0.0005128205128205586,0.42483696713845187,0.0005128205128205586,0.0005128205128205586,0.0005128205128205586,0.0005128205128205586,0.0005128205128205586,0.0005128205128205586,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
43200,0,"Well , for starters , this actually was THE most elegant Clausen film to this date . The man 's always got a sense for characters with a slice of humor to them , but I think that he in this movie adds a dimension unparrallel to anything he 's made earlier . His work has - in very black n ' white words - been accepted by the broad but not that critical audience , and we 've always appreciated his sense of humor and his ability to mix it with human problems and a distinct way of letting the audience know what he needs to say . In "" Villa Paranoia , however , for the first time , he surprises with an unseen wisdom and a respect for the minorities . Not only the ethnic but also the normal people you tend to forget . Set in Jutland - in ' the country ' - it deals with the everlasting issue of lack of love , but in a close and at times brutal way that keeps you looking and keeps you focused . And on top of that , he himself manages to play a b******d ! A true b*****d , who wants the right thing but has no clue how to get there , and people therefore suffer . Bitterly .

43668,0,"This film could well have been one of those ordinary "" soapies "" relating the day to day events of half a dozen families whose lives are intertwined .. broken relationships , building new friendships , street bashings , near accidents , hopes and dreams and even the discovery of a baby discarded under some bushes ! What a mixture of events!Fortunately the film maker goes beyond those daily events and poses questions to consider although there are no satisfactory answers . He asks in this chaotic world do things just happen , is it just luck when things turn out right or , taking a fatalistic view , is a person predestined to be at a certain place at a certain time and thus become involved in the event and his future takes on a new perspective ? Most of us have had this uncanny experience . Is it our super ego that makes us believe we are so important ? As one character says he once sat on the edge overlooking the Grand Canyon and came to realize how infinitely small he was . This is not one of my favourite films but is a good study of human relationships . Danny Glover is outstanding in a sympathetic role .",212,1,0.2316636672951602,0.13568224444817242,0.0005882352941176821,0.0005882352941176821,0.0005882352941176821,0.0005882352941176821,0.0005882352941176821,0.3342105409533518,0.0005882352941176821,0.0005882352941176821,0.0005882352941176821,0.0005882352941176821,0.0005882352941176821,0.0005882352941176821,0.029999249370571062,0.0005882352941176821,0.0005882352941176821,0.0005882352941176821,0.0005882352941176821,0.0005882352941176821,0.0005882352941176821,0.0005882352941176821,0.0005882352941176821,0.0005882352941176821,0.03243352807356863,0.0005882352941176821,0.0005882352941176821,0.0005882352941176821,0.0005882352941176821,0.0005882352941176821,0.0005882352941176821,0.0005882352941176821,0.04318255470453185,0.0005882352941176821,0.0005882352941176821,0.0005882352941176821,0.0005882352941176821,0.0005882352941176821,0.0005882352941176821,0.0005882352941176821,0.0005882352941176821,0.0005882352941176821,0.0005882352941176821,0.16753409750758372,0.0005882352941176821,0.0005882352941176821,0.0005882352941176821,0.0005882352941176821,0.0005882352941176821,0.0005882352941176821,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
43702,0,"Murder in Mesopotamia , I have always considered one of the better Poirot books , as it is very creepy and has an ingenious ending . There is no doubt that the TV adaptation is visually striking , with some lovely photography and a very haunting music score . As always David Suchet is impeccable as Hercule Poirot , the comedic highlight of the episode being Poirot 's battle with a mosquito in the middle of the night , and Hugh Fraser is good as the rather naive Captain Hastings . The remainder of the cast turn in decent performances , but are careful not to overshadow the two leads , a danger in some Christie adaptations . Some of the episode was quite creepy , a juxtaposition of an episode as tragic as Five Little Pigs , an episode that I enjoyed a lot more than this one . What made it creepy in particular , putting aside the music was when Louise Leidner sees the ghostly face through the window . About the adaptation , it was fairly faithful to the book , but I will say that there were three things I did n't like . The main problem was the pacing , it is rather slow , and there are some scenes where very little happens . I did n't like the fact also that they made Joseph Mercado a murderer . In the book , I see him as a rather nervous character , but the intervention of the idea of making him a murderer , and under - developing that , made him a less appealing character , though I am glad they did n't miss his drug addiction . ( I also noticed that the writers left out the fact that Mrs Mercado in the book falls into hysteria when she believes she is the murderer 's next victim . ) The other thing that was n't so impressive was that I felt that it may have been more effective if the adaptation had been in the viewpoint of Amy Leatheran , like it was in the book , Amy somehow seemed less sensitive in the adaptation . On the whole , despite some misjudgements on the writers ' behalf , I liked Murder in Mesopotamia . 7/10 Bethany Cox .",388,1,0.1676817528266356,0.00038461538461541936,0.00038461538461541936,0.00038461538461541936,0.00038461538461541936,0.00038461538461541936,0.00038461538461541936,0.00038461538461541936,0.00038461538461541936,0.00038461538461541936,0.00038461538461541936,0.00038461538461541936,0.00038461538461541936,0.00038461538461541936,0.00038461538461541936,0.00038461538461541936,0.00038461538461541936,0.00038461538461541936,0.00038461538461541936,0.02171855231616303,0.00038461538461541936,0.3158265694527248,0.00038461538461541936,0.00038461538461541936,0.00038461538461541936,0.00038461538461541936,0.00038461538461541936,0.00038461538461541936,0.04073399345103592,0.00038461538461541936,0.00038461538461541936,0.00038461538461541936,0.00038461538461541936,0.00038461538461541936,0.00038461538461541936,0.09660314767050356,0.21720433686734403,0.00038461538461541936,0.00038461538461541936,0.00038461538461541936,0.00038461538461541936,0.00038461538461541936,0.00038461538461541936,0.12369318587713009,0.00038461538461541936,0.00038461538461541936,0.00038461538461541936,0.00038461538461541936,0.00038461538461541936,0.00038461538461541936,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
43796,0,"Harvey Keital 's best performance so far the new century . Very nicely photographed , a beautiful snap - shot of pre - Castro Cuba . The story revolves around the nephew of a local minor crime boss who develops a friendship with an American with Hollywood connections . It 's really about the moment when a boy awakens to the fact that the small circle of people he knows actually live in a much larger , much more complex world that he does n't yet understand.the script is strong and filled with humor , the direction is crisp . Over all , a really professional job that fits in well with the tradition of Latin American cinema . The one weakness is the decision to shoot in sync - sound English rather than Spanish - probably to improve sales in the US . Unfortunately , this just makes the film a little less convincing . But if you can see beyond this , you will find a heartfelt trip to another world .

44463,0,"This movie is one of my very favorites . It 's hard to explain why . Maybe it 's the innocence of Corin Nemec and his awkwardness paired with the boldness of Cheryl Pollak , but it definitely has something to do with the soundtrack . Also , some of the characters have little lines or movements or moments that are amusing in and of themselves . Finally , the story is one that always tugs at my heartstrings , and the last scene is so bittersweet .

44609,0,"I do n't know what it is with this movies . But movies about history or religion are always criticised by their accuracy . Of course it 's not 100 % accurate . It 's difficult to make 100 % accurate films nowadays when even the "" experts "" disagree with each other . Therefore I rather like to judge a movie by what it is trying to say than pick on all the inaccuracies . So I start by saying that I liked this mini serie . But I do agree with the critique that his childhood years went by too fast . The series should have been a three part story , his childhood being the first part . But if they did n't have more money to shoot more story who am I to criticise that???There 's only one real problem I have with this movie and that 's the fact that it 's told in a history book way . Especially the second part which is just a sum of events that happened . I rather would have liked to see Hitler more humane ( more scenes where he doubts himself etc . ) . Noah Taylor did that more in the movie ' Max ' which seem to work better I think . Nevertheless I 'm glad this was made and own it on DVD .

44788,0,"The best thing about this movie is that it is fun . It is full of humorous characters and interesting situations , starting with the blithe , innocent Pecker ( played appealingly by Edward Furlong ) who likes to photograph almost everything he sees in every day life . Other great characters include Pecker 's friend Matt ( "" he 's a thief , but he 's really a nice guy "" ) , Pecker 's sister Chrissy ( who is addicted to sugar ) , and Pecker 's Catholic grandmother who discovers life in a statuette of the Virgin Mary in her room . The movie gently makes a point about how every day life has many riches to offer , and it succeeds in making this point without being too heavy - handed about it . There is always a risk , when making messages about the value and dignity of "" common people "" , of sliding into a kind of reverse "" holier than thou "" - but "" Pecker "" avoids these traps , allowing the audience to get the point while allowing enough breathing room for viewers to compare this message to their own thoughts on the subject .

44864,0,"This is an interesting little flick made in 1967 , with cool jazzy twangy soundtrack music and a plot that will make you laugh ... OK , it 's not really stupid but it 's cheesy fun . I saw many similarities between this and ' Creature with the Blue Hand ' ( AKA The Bloody Dead ) and they do have the same director ! Scotland Yard 's finest is investigating the murders of young ladies at a college . Seems that criminals are being let loose from a local prison to do the bidding of some evil person and then returned when their work is done . There 's a nifty device hidden inside a bible that squirts prussic acid , and there 's another device that is neither nifty nor clandestine , it looks like a large squirt gun and the victim must be pretty near soaked before they expire . Joachim Fuchsberger plays an Inspector and he mostly chews gum and looks off into the distance . There 's a "" monk "" , and how anyone identifies this thing as a "" monk "" is beyond me , it carries a whip and dresses in a red outfit with a red hood , more of a Klan member of a different color than a monk . There 's all kinds of nifty devices like a fireplace hearth that goes up and down to admit the monk , and it steps right over the fire without setting his robe alight , a nifty trick right there . This is an odd combo of crime drama with goofy overtones , and while it 's rather silly at times it is fun to watch . 7 out of 10 , not bad ....",295,1,0.0004878048780488216,0.0004878048780488216,0.0004878048780488216,0.030699380135637337,0.0004878048780488216,0.0004878048780488216,0.02487804887039948,0.0004878048780488216,0.07622057152760701,0.0004878048780488216,0.0004878048780488216,0.0004878048780488216,0.0004878048780488216,0.0004878048780488216,0.0004878048780488216,0.0004878048780488216,0.11492319248610909,0.0004878048780488216,0.0004878048780488216,0.0004878048780488216,0.42528593586458646,0.07791253029788411,0.0004878048780488216,0.0004878048780488216,0.0004878048780488216,0.0004878048780488216,0.0004878048780488216,0.0004878048780488216,0.0004878048780488216,0.0004878048780488216,0.0004878048780488216,0.0004878048780488216,0.0004878048780488216,0.0004878048780488216,0.10394085348959957,0.0004878048780488216,0.0004878048780488216,0.0004878048780488216,0.12565168245012637,0.0004878048780488216,0.0004878048780488216,0.0004878048780488216,0.0004878048780488216,0.0004878048780488216,0.0004878048780488216,0.0004878048780488216,0.0004878048780488216,0.0004878048780488216,0.0004878048780488216,0.0004878048780488216,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Creepier than anything David Lynch , and that shows what a great director Polanski is since this is not his usual type of work , and it is BRILLIANT.It all starts of with Trelkovski moves into a tenement block in Paris . He soon learns that the previous tenant , a young woman , committed suicide and he believes the rest of the people living there drove her to it . He also believes that they are trying to do the same to him . What results is a amazing and frightening look at paranoia . The whole production has classical horror written all over it : from the imagery to the music the viewer can feel poor Trelkovski 's terror building up . Are they all out to kill him ? Or maybe just drive him mad ? Is there a difference ?

For anybody who thinks comedy has to be dumb-- there is more wit and intelligence in the six episodes of this series than in a shelf of novels ! Hugh Laurie is a complete hoot . I could n't believe it was the same guy as House ! There are so many great lines and gags in this series you could watch each show dozens of times and still pick up on new things each time . Rowan Atkinson is hilarious as the verbose and put upon butler Edmund . This is my favorite of all the Blackadder series . And Tony Robinson is wonderful as ever as the somewhat obtuse heart of the series , "" the oppressed mass "" Baldrick .

45251,0,""" The Grudge "" is a remake of Shimizu 's own series of popular Japanese horror films . Shimizu knows he is not dealing with anything new , so he does what any intelligent person would have done in his place : he forgets logic and concentrates in giving viewers a fun ride . He uses commonly known clichés associated with ghost stories but Shimizu plays with these elements in an imaginative manner . The nonlinear narrative is not a mere gimmick but an interesting way to present sequences from different perspectives . At the end , all I can say is that if the only purpose of a horror film is to scare the audience ( the same way a comedy is to make people laugh ) , this movie succeeded with flying colors . I watched it in a theater with an audience and it was fun to see viewers go wild over this one . It probably does n't play as well in your living room .",170,1,0.0006060606060606517,0.050412592333773876,0.0006060606060606517,0.0006060606060606517,0.0006060606060606517,0.0006060606060606517,0.0006060606060606517,0.0006060606060606517,0.0006060606060606517,0.0006060606060606517,0.0006060606060606517,0.0006060606060606517,0.0006060606060606517,0.0006060606060606517,0.0006060606060606517,0.0006060606060606517,0.0006060606060606517,0.0006060606060606517,0.0006060606060606517,0.0006060606060606517,0.39001635579679045,0.0006060606060606517,0.0006060606060606517,0.030972045861201974,0.0006060606060606517,0.0006060606060606517,0.0006060606060606517,0.0006060606060606517,0.0006060606060606517,0.0006060606060606517,0.0006060606060606517,0.0006060606060606517,0.1647743815260888,0.0006060606060606517,0.11340714727995964,0.0006060606060606517,0.0006060606060606517,0.0006060606060606517,0.0006060606060606517,0.0006060606060606517,0.0006060606060606517,0.0006060606060606517,0.0006060606060606517,0.2237508105355165,0.0006060606060606517,0.0006060606060606517,0.0006060606060606517,0.0006060606060606517,0.0006060606060606517,0.0006060606060606517,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

I would give nearly anything to have it on DVD or whatever format I can get . If you find any means of seeing this series I suggest you take full advantage . This series was the first one ( in my opinion ) that had a truly coherent storyline that spanned across multiple episodes . It also made me truly care about the characters and what happened to them . Heck the character Goose actually scared me sometimes . He was just that odd at the time . Also the leader of the group reminds me a lot of a combination of Clint Eastwood / Tommy Lee Jones .

45418,0,"Okay this movie fine like I said but you surely need to watch it as its worth a watch . It 's about two boys Mac and Sam who are great friends and work as fashion photographers and the laughing time starts when Mac ( Akshay Kumar ) starts dating with 3 air hostesses at the same time leaving his wife suspicious . Sam attains fortune and almost forgets his friend but not completely . But Mac thinks so and so he starts dating with air hostesses . there 's garam masala at every step of the movie , songs rock but somethings lacking . The comedy 's not up to the mark and deserves an award . Its nice but not all that excellent . Some people laughed till their stomaches ached but it did n't deserve that many laughs . But of course everyone 's opinion is different .

45495,0,""" World 's Finest "" is an unique project . It 's a trailer for a Superman / Batman crossover movie that does n't exists and will also never exists , at least not in this form , with these characters , actors and plot line anyway . So the movie is one big tease , even more than standards everyday real movie trailers . The trailer will hype you all up for nothing . In that regard , I really did n't liked this short project . When watching this trailer it makes you hungry and excited for more and at the same time sad- and perhaps you 'll even feel cheated afterward , when it turns out that a full length movie of this trailer will never exist at all . Sort of makes you wonder why this project was made in the first place . Surely to show off Sandy Collora 's skills but could n't he had also done this with a real movie short , like his earlier movie "" Batman : Dead End"" . But when you have to judge this short purely for what it is , so from a movie technical point of view , it 's a really great one . It 's great looking and way more professional than you 'll perhaps at first would expect , although the people who 've already seen "" Batman : Dead End "" will already know better than to expect a short with cardboard sets , cheap homemade costumes and third - rate actors . The short is not constantly impressive looking and obviously the budget was n't sky - high but for most part it 's very impressive and professional looking , with nice costumes , sets , special effects , cinematography and lighting . The short has a good quick and typical trailer build up , with perhaps a bit too many posing shots too completely find it credible but hey , it works well for the trailer style . It has some impressive shots but also a couple of lame ones , mainly the Superman flying sequences . It was obvious that the guy was just standing at a moving car , with a camera aimed at him from an angle below . I even found it a pretty laughable thing to watch . But really the better and more spectacular moments really compensate for this . Michael O'Hearn seemed like a pretty good Superman / Clark Kent , although he obviously is n't the greatest talented actor around . Clark Bartram reprises his Batman role well again and Kurt Carley seemed like an awesome Lex Luthor . The rest of the cast also served its purpose well enough . It 's especially interesting to watch this short after the recent new modern reinterpretations of the two main superheroes of this movie , in the movies "" Batman Begins "" and "" Superman Returns "" . It 's interesting to compare the style and character treatment of those movies with this one . It 's actually amazing and fun to hear how much Kurt Carley does sound like Kevin Spacey , the actor who played Lex Luthor in "" Superman Returns"" . It 's a good looking and well made and constructed trailer that however will makes you hungry for more , even though you know that there wo n't be more . Whatever happened to the Waner Bros. plans to create an actual full length Superman / Batman movie by the way ? I thought that developments were underway for it a couple of years ago but nothing has been heard of it ever since . Instead two new separate Batman and Superman movies were made ; "" Batman Begins "" and "" Superman Returns"".7/10",636,1,0.00015748031496064675,0.028550031091618217,0.00015748031496064675,0.00015748031496064675,0.00015748031496064675,0.00015748031496064675,0.026470243315751905,0.00015748031496064675,0.00015748031496064675,0.00015748031496064675,0.00015748031496064675,0.00015748031496064675,0.00015748031496064675,0.00015748031496064675,0.00015748031496064675,0.00015748031496064675,0.00015748031496064675,0.00015748031496064675,0.00015748031496064675,0.009729183304385733,0.5721637817454411,0.21968528051508165,0.00015748031496064675,0.00015748031496064675,0.00015748031496064675,0.059495370401521044,0.00015748031496064675,0.00015748031496064675,0.008862839125043563,0.04120826553147281,0.00015748031496064675,0.00015748031496064675,0.00015748031496064675,0.00015748031496064675,0.00015748031496064675,0.00015748031496064675,0.00015748031496064675,0.00015748031496064675,0.00015748031496064675,0.00015748031496064675,0.02737831205629763,0.00015748031496064675,0.00015748031496064675,0.00015748031496064675,0.00015748031496064675,0.00015748031496064675,0.00015748031496064675,0.00015748031496064675,0.00015748031496064675,0.00015748031496064675,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
45553,0,"This is an odd film for me , as after I reviewed a nice film from a new film maker ( FAR OUT by Phil Mucci ) , another writer / director , Ryan Jafri , contacted me and asked me to watch and review his film , THE CURE . I do n't normally review films this way , but what the heck -- I love shorts and could n't wait to see another . Interestingly , while it turned out I did like THE CURE , I was not thrilled by it and let Jafri know . To his credit , he encouraged me to review it anyway -- giving it my honest appraisal . The film has tremendous style and as far as Jafri 's direction goes , it 's exceptional -- especially for such an inexperienced film maker ( it 's his first film ) . The combination of exceptional choices of color , pacing and music that well - suited the film created a great sense of atmosphere . You really are pulled into the film and that is a credit to the film making . However , the thing I did n't love was some of the writing . While the basic idea was great , the ending was just too easy to foresee . I really would have loved the ending had it come as more of a surprise or there to have been an unexpected twist . However , considering that this film is from someone who should n't be able to make such a professional film given his experience , it bodes well for his future .

45661,0,"I 'm a bit conflicted over this . The show is on one hand awful , the acting is terrible ( even when we get actual name actors like Brad Pitt and Bill Moseley in one episode ) , the dialogue is moronic and the premise / moral of each episode feels like something lifted out of a 50s educational short . There 's no way you 'll be scared for a moment from any of these episodes , and Robert Englund 's cameos are short , pointless and corny in a sort of a Bob Saget on America 's Funniest Home Videos kind of way . On the other hand this is one of the funniest things to ever be on television . The 80s fashions , the soft focus makes the actors look like their on the set of The View at all times , the premises lend the material more to self - parody than scares , so we 're left with an episode where a high school kid is afraid if he fails his SAT 's his girlfriend will dump him and his parents disown him , another is afraid she 'll be locked up in prison because she 's a substandard mom ( her husband is played by Brad Pit ) , another is afraid that all the parents in the world are in league against him when he runs away from home , another is afraid she 'll be confused with her socially - retarded twin , another is afraid if he does n't break up his mom and step - dad he 'll get killed for having a party at his house . The list goes on and on . Being that these are dreams I suppose you could look past the ludicrous plot points and devices , but they 're so out of left field that there 's no opportunities for the writers to actually scare the audience . You have characters dressed like something out of a 80s - themed nightmare wandering around delivering bad dialogue in very hammy fashion and making illogical decisions that serve no other purpose but to move the story to the next weird plot point ( typically watching as a peripheral character does something uncharacteristic of a sane person while our main character stares aghast and too shocked to do anything about it).If you 're looking for something that 'll scare you stay away . If you 're looking , on the other hand , for one of the funniest things to come out of the 80s ever . Watch it . Its been showing on Chiller TV lately ( pretty much every day ) and I 've been watching , earlier out of morbid curiosity , and now just so I can get a good laugh in each day .

45670,0,"I had to give this film a 10 simply because it did what so many films thrown at black audiences have FAILED MISERABLY to do . This film was void of all the video whore clichés , and it also skipped the gangsters , rappers , and foul language . It examined several relationships among physicians , African Americans , and African American male / female romantic relationships on a completely new and refreshing level . I was highly impressed with the films careful mix of light headed humor with some pretty tough and heavy issues . The film will leave you feeling happy and sad all at the same time . I saw it at the Boston Film Festival as well . It premiered at AMC Loews Boston and I truly hope this film makes it to much larger audiences . Black People ( and EVERYONE else ) would LOVE a movie like this- if only the industry was SMART enough to put them out there!As an extra- if your a doctor , a resident , a medical student , a premedical student , married to a doctor , have a doctor sibling , have a doctor in the family , or know a great doctor period- they would love this film as well . It portrayed residency and the practice in a true - to - life way that was greatly appreciated by the doctors , residents , and medical students who viewed the film . Dennis Cooper completely his residency in internal medicine- so he definitely applied his knowledge / experience to the film and that is greatly apparent .",273,1,0.00040000000000003086,0.08916143996650426,0.00040000000000003086,0.06330269940859269,0.00040000000000003086,0.00040000000000003086,0.00040000000000003086,0.00040000000000003086,0.00040000000000003086,0.00040000000000003086,0.00040000000000003086,0.021794984278354808,0.00040000000000003086,0.00040000000000003086,0.00040000000000003086,0.00040000000000003086,0.00040000000000003086,0.00040000000000003086,0.00040000000000003086,0.00040000000000003086,0.02700805782065531,0.00040000000000003086,0.00040000000000003086,0.00040000000000003086,0.021646298179354102,0.04890373890572062,0.00040000000000003086,0.00040000000000003086,0.00040000000000003086,0.00040000000000003086,0.00040000000000003086,0.021429144380913104,0.00040000000000003086,0.00040000000000003086,0.00040000000000003086,0.07922566905244201,0.00040000000000003086,0.022132127231042263,0.00040000000000003086,0.00040000000000003086,0.00040000000000003086,0.00040000000000003086,0.00040000000000003086,0.53201557987338,0.00040000000000003086,0.05778026090303953,0.00040000000000003086,0.00040000000000003086,0.00040000000000003086,0.00040000000000003086,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0
45880,0,"This is a clever episode of TWILIGHT ZONE that was comic rather than strange or tragic . Buster Keaton is Woodrow Mulligan , a janitor from 1890 America , works in a laboratory . He is constantly griping about the life problems around him : meat is too expensive ( it 's like $ 1.00 / lb . Unheard of ! ) . He is always yelling after crazy speeders ( on bicycles - autos have n't appeared yet ) . Griping to the end , he sees a helmet like device by a scientist , and puts it on and tries it . Suddenly he is in modern America . The beginning was a seven minute silent film . Now it is all noise , all talking , all beeping , all blowing . Keaton is here only a few minutes when he realizes that the world has changed and not for the better . He runs into Stanley Adams , a Professor Rollo , who realizes that Mulligan is from c. 1890 ( he mentions President Cleveland ) . Rollo has always wanted to live in that charming , quiet age . He helps Mulligan get the helmet repaired , and they go back in time . Rollo gets bored after awhile , due to the lack of scientific equipment that he can use . Mulligan puts the helmet on him and sends him into the future . But now Woodrow is fully content with the quiet , simple age he lives in . He has found contentment . In his last fifteen years Buster Keaton was frequently on television ( many times for Allan Funt on CANDID CAMERA , where he could help set up sight gag tricks on the public ) . He did make a few films as well ( most notably A FUNNY THING HAPPENED ON THE WAY TO THE FORUM and THE RAILRODDER ) . But he occasionally popped up in television plays and episodes . He is in his element here , presumably advising the director ( old comedy film director Norman McLeod - he directed the Marx Brothers in HORSE FEATHERS ) on the tricks he could do . Watch how Stanley Adams and he time Adams picking him up when he is snatching a pair of trousers he needs . In terms of timing it reminds one of gags he did in the 20s in films like SHERLOCK JR . The episode does show Keaton in fine fettle for a man in his sixties . The appearances of Jesse White ( here as a repairman , of all things ) is always welcome . But look a bit at "" Professor Rollo "" . Stanley Adams was a well known figure in movies and television from the 1950s onward to his tragic suicide in 1977 . Plump , with unkempt appearance , and heavy , booming voice , his best known dramatic role was as the wrestling promoter in the film version of REQUIEM FOR A HEAVYWEIGHT ( he wants Anthony Quinn to be a wrestler wearing a costume as an Indian ) . His best known television appearance was as the space trader who introduces the crew of the Starship Enterprise in STAR TREK to those furry , fertile little creatures "" Tribbles "" ( as in "" The Trouble With "" ) . Adams was always worth watching ( like Jesse White , and certainly like Keaton ) , enhancing most of the productions he appeared in . I have never understood his suicide , but it was a sad end to a first rate character performer .",610,1,0.09824219678619361,0.015947399351653027,0.00025316455696205157,0.00025316455696205157,0.037907623123986905,0.00025316455696205157,0.00025316455696205157,0.1739306952459982,0.03252955578266724,0.00025316455696205157,0.00025316455696205157,0.00025316455696205157,0.00025316455696205157,0.00025316455696205157,0.00025316455696205157,0.00025316455696205157,0.00025316455696205157,0.00025316455696205157,0.012905678534562422,0.00025316455696205157,0.19940262483601104,0.00025316455696205157,0.00025316455696205157,0.00025316455696205157,0.00025316455696205157,0.013524704358976921,0.00025316455696205157,0.00025316455696205157,0.00025316455696205157,0.00025316455696205157,0.00025316455696205157,0.00025316455696205157,0.00025316455696205157,0.00025316455696205157,0.00025316455696205157,0.05749054937112928,0.00025316455696205157,0.00025316455696205157,0.04158773304611742,0.00025316455696205157,0.021261077736290598,0.00025316455696205157,0.00025316455696205157,0.2730573172760401,0.00025316455696205157,0.00025316455696205157,0.012845755942777494,0.00025316455696205157,0.00025316455696205157,0.00025316455696205157,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0
45915,0,""" Welcome to Collingwood "" offers some of the most hilarious dialog in recent memory . Watching this comedy directed by the brothers Anthony and Joe Russo reminded us of maybe another film we had seen in the past , but since we missed the opening credits , we had to wait until the end to discover that what we were reminded of , was the 1958 Italian film "" Big Deal on Madonna Street "" , directed by Mario Monicelli . The Russo brothers put together a magnificent cast to portray all the characters in the film . Anything with William H. Macy , Luis Guzman , Sam Rockwell , Patricia Clarkson , the late Michael Jeter , in it , ca n't be bad . Since this is an ensemble piece all characters get an opportunity in which to shine . The film presents us a group of inane would - be safe crackers from hell . No one could think these men could carry on a job like the one they undertake . Whatever could go wrong , and more , is what they succeed in doing . George Clooney makes a small appearance as the master safe cracker who is also seen impersonating a rabbi , only to be confused with a priest by the gang members coming out of Cossimo 's funeral . The best way to enjoy the movie is to sit back and relax , and let all these small time crooks do their thing . Let their funny lines make you laugh , as anyone can see this gang is doomed from beginning to end !",274,1,0.00046511627906980596,0.00046511627906980596,0.00046511627906980596,0.00046511627906980596,0.00046511627906980596,0.00046511627906980596,0.00046511627906980596,0.1069620860979972,0.00046511627906980596,0.00046511627906980596,0.00046511627906980596,0.00046511627906980596,0.00046511627906980596,0.00046511627906980596,0.02158283714802354,0.00046511627906980596,0.00046511627906980596,0.00046511627906980596,0.00046511627906980596,0.00046511627906980596,0.6294899661652009,0.00046511627906980596,0.00046511627906980596,0.00046511627906980596,0.0496128453381566,0.00046511627906980596,0.00046511627906980596,0.00046511627906980596,0.00046511627906980596,0.00046511627906980596,0.00046511627906980596,0.00046511627906980596,0.00046511627906980596,0.00046511627906980596,0.00046511627906980596,0.00046511627906980596,0.00046511627906980596,0.00046511627906980596,0.00046511627906980596,0.00046511627906980596,0.00046511627906980596,0.00046511627906980596,0.00046511627906980596,0.17142203269248044,0.00046511627906980596,0.00046511627906980596,0.00046511627906980596,0.00046511627906980596,0.00046511627906980596,0.00046511627906980596,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
46041,0,"A famous conductor decides after a heart attack to go back to the village where he was born to live a quiet life . There , he comes in Dutch with the local church choir , that will change his life . I had no expectations when I saw this movie for the first time yesterday ; I like watching foreign movies that are not English , and I 've already seen a couple of Swedish movies in my life , but this one was the best so far . Where to start ? In my opinion , this film is a jewel , thanks to many things , of which one is the outstanding acting . Michael Nyqvist is perfect as the thoughtful , almost shy and devoted conductor Daniel Daréus . Beautiful Frida Hallgren is enchanting with her pretty smile and her subtle acting . The choir members are all well - developed , interesting characters with their own story each . This movie tells a story , a beautiful story , about music , love , pain , memories , death , about a man who devoted his life to music , and who tries to create a calm existence in the village where he was born , while trying to make peace with the past and with the way his life has been till then . Kay Pollack shows us that the Swedish are outstanding movie creators . Go see Så som i himmelen , it 's a movie that makes you think about life and love , and that 's also comforting , in some way .",272,1,0.0003636363636363869,0.0003636363636363869,0.0003636363636363869,0.0003636363636363869,0.0003636363636363869,0.0003636363636363869,0.0003636363636363869,0.2885966860763428,0.0003636363636363869,0.0003636363636363869,0.0003636363636363869,0.0003636363636363869,0.0003636363636363869,0.0003636363636363869,0.0003636363636363869,0.0003636363636363869,0.0003636363636363869,0.0003636363636363869,0.0003636363636363869,0.0003636363636363869,0.39903062922558247,0.05841999979399816,0.0003636363636363869,0.0003636363636363869,0.0003636363636363869,0.08323704150115126,0.0003636363636363869,0.0003636363636363869,0.020116981869903718,0.0003636363636363869,0.0003636363636363869,0.0003636363636363869,0.02315804396911605,0.0003636363636363869,0.09317893970164656,0.0003636363636363869,0.0003636363636363869,0.018988950589530748,0.0003636363636363869,0.0003636363636363869,0.0003636363636363869,0.0003636363636363869,0.0003636363636363869,0.0003636363636363869,0.0003636363636363869,0.0003636363636363869,0.0003636363636363869,0.0003636363636363869,0.0003636363636363869,0.0003636363636363869,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
46142,0,"I saw this Documentary at the Cannes Film Festival , in a small 200-seat Cinema at the top of the main building at the Cannes Film Festival . I absolutely was into it . I love the mix of awesomely made fictional scenes . It is amazing set - design . The scenes look really like they were filmed in 1920ies or 1930ies . And the music is so nice . I rate this experience 9/10 . * spoilers ahead * The Documentary tells about awesome Blues - men , with black - and - white old - looking scenes of the black man playing the guitar and singing . It is really amazing . But this also mixes in new bands and that is maybe one thing I might dislike in this Documentary . It is the too abundant use of links to modern rock - bands playing those Blues songs in a modern way . I did n't really appreciate their trashed way of playing such awesome Blues songs . This is the same kind of un - perfect musical taste I found when watching Wim Wenders Buena Vista Social Club . The Documentary was such a standing - ovation at this first screening in the little cinema , that the next day this Documentary was shown for everyone and normal tourists on the beach of the Croisette at the open - air cinema . Though the sand , the quality of the projection and the bad quality of the sound probably made it a difficult experience to enjoy for the thousands of people who were sitting in the sand that night .",275,1,0.000338983050847484,0.10095940712213794,0.038826323567444976,0.040831349244924695,0.000338983050847484,0.000338983050847484,0.0394920750908091,0.13168435851511293,0.04027462396132987,0.000338983050847484,0.000338983050847484,0.000338983050847484,0.08541494182543641,0.000338983050847484,0.000338983050847484,0.000338983050847484,0.000338983050847484,0.000338983050847484,0.000338983050847484,0.000338983050847484,0.000338983050847484,0.10333229256017193,0.000338983050847484,0.000338983050847484,0.000338983050847484,0.09276689655293945,0.000338983050847484,0.000338983050847484,0.07395620608204977,0.000338983050847484,0.000338983050847484,0.000338983050847484,0.000338983050847484,0.000338983050847484,0.000338983050847484,0.0580658940931766,0.000338983050847484,0.000338983050847484,0.000338983050847484,0.000338983050847484,0.000338983050847484,0.000338983050847484,0.000338983050847484,0.15782206191973114,0.000338983050847484,0.000338983050847484,0.024031196583378312,0.000338983050847484,0.000338983050847484,0.000338983050847484,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0
46170,0,"It 's a refreshing breath of air when a movie actually gives you a story line with a beginning , a middle , and a end , a nice , clever mystery , with an appealing heroine for all ages , who wins us over with her wit and charm . Andrew Fleming 's film is indeed a modern marvel , a comeback to the good old reliable storytelling that was the norm in Hollywood . He puts away the over - reliance on special effects that now passes for entertainment and gives us a terrific film , with a very capable young actress , and a talented supporting cast . The film is based on the old books , but it has been given updated enough to put in this century ; however , the props might be different , the heart still is a good mystery , and there is clever one here , one that ties the traditions of the old and the nuances of contemporary youth . Emma Roberts is an old fashioned girl , who believes in good behavior and respect for others ; details that are sorely missing from today 's films . She is still good enough to get boys ' attentions but she also knows how present poise and self respect . She earns her medals by working hard and is not afraid to show a little guile when it is needed to achieve her goals . While taking a vacation to California , our heroine is drawn into the mystery of a Hollywood actress who was the victim of foul play ; suddenly she is "" visited "" by her ghost and this sets off a series of events that might solve the mystery or result in something dreadful for herself . What makes the movie quite entertaining is the little details , as she discovers that her customary world is nothing compared to the California scene , and this is well presented , without resorting to unnecessary vulgar language or anything graphic or overtly sexual . Eventually , the director has enough control to make it all very palatable to all types of audiences , from the young ones to the adults in the audience . It is a movie that deserves to be seen , appreciated , and enjoyed , a film that is rare and delicate , and it 's not afraid to be classified as fun !

46183,0,"I know the film snobs are snorting . But if you 're looking for a surprisingly fun ride through the B - movie jungle , try "" Jake Speed"" . A little thin at times , but its one - liners and the location more then make up for this . John Hurt(God love him ) , seems to be having fun doing his role as the ultra evil white slaver . The nemesis of Crawfords , Jake Speed . He adds a dimension to the film that only a pro like Hurt could provide . Crawford and Dennis Christopher ( Jakes sidekick ) are a good team , although you do wonder why they both put up with each other . However , together both Crawford and Christopher portray a team that is just so much fun that , if you can get over yourself for a moment , you may find yourself acting like a kid again at the situations and the inherent suspense they provide . The delicious Karen Kopins does a great job as the damsel in distress that is more concerned about the motives of her rescuer then her tormentor . I have yet to find a movie that is as much fun without getting preachy , or bogging down the movie by trying too hard . Not every movie has to be the latest "" Citizen Kane "" . And trust me , Wells was an original . So lets remember that sometimes , movies are for fun . Not social commentary or attempting to sway an audience politically . But just for the sheer fun of being alive and living in a time when our hero 's live in a celluloid dimension .",290,1,0.0004444444444444707,0.0004444444444444707,0.0004444444444444707,0.0004444444444444707,0.0004444444444444707,0.0004444444444444707,0.0004444444444444707,0.08238694534854675,0.0004444444444444707,0.0004444444444444707,0.0004444444444444707,0.0004444444444444707,0.0004444444444444707,0.0004444444444444707,0.0004444444444444707,0.0004444444444444707,0.09351951522052372,0.0004444444444444707,0.0004444444444444707,0.0004444444444444707,0.6045296370980916,0.0004444444444444707,0.0004444444444444707,0.0004444444444444707,0.0004444444444444707,0.0004444444444444707,0.0004444444444444707,0.0004444444444444707,0.0004444444444444707,0.0004444444444444707,0.0004444444444444707,0.0004444444444444707,0.0004444444444444707,0.0004444444444444707,0.17688741152931178,0.02267649080352486,0.0004444444444444707,0.0004444444444444707,0.0004444444444444707,0.0004444444444444707,0.0004444444444444707,0.0004444444444444707,0.0004444444444444707,0.0004444444444444707,0.0004444444444444707,0.0004444444444444707,0.0004444444444444707,0.0004444444444444707,0.0004444444444444707,0.0004444444444444707,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

But , still , it 's carried out fairly well , and the story & especially the dialogue are interesting . They 've taken the dialogue pretty much exactly as is from the actual play . Perhaps it 's a good introduction to Shaw 's plays . The main character Raina has her head in the clouds & and a flair for the dramatic , and Helena Bonham Carter 's acting does a good job here .

46398,0,"WHERE THE SIDEWALK ENDS deserves to be a better known film directed by Otto Preminger , the man who gave the world LAURA . And this time , he 's got the same co - stars : DANA ANDREWS and GENE TIERNEY . It must be said that Tierney here is under - used in what amounts to more of a supporting role while the spotlight goes to Andrews . He plays a tough , hardened cop used to dealing with a bunch of thugs in too vigorous a way until one night he accidentally kills a man in the process of arresting him . When suspicion falls on a cab driver ( TOM TULLY ) , he goes along with the investigation into the murder but starts to feel guilt because he 's in love with the cabbie 's daughter ( GENE TIERNEY ) . Tierney , by the way , looks a little too elegant for the girl she 's playing here and does n't seem to fit into the squalid background elements of the story . The story takes a grim turn as the investigation goes deeper and it 's discovered that the murdered man had a silver plate in his head from his service as a war hero . By the end , it turns into a morality tale with Andrews developing a conscience over his crime . It 's fascinating as film noir with capable performances from a strong supporting cast . A good entry in the field of noir , forcefully directed by Preminger and nicely played by Andrews and Tierney , despite the slight miscasting of her character .",276,1,0.10617080029845684,0.0004081632653061586,0.0004081632653061586,0.0004081632653061586,0.0004081632653061586,0.026775321763557226,0.0004081632653061586,0.19933065838742622,0.0004081632653061586,0.0004081632653061586,0.0004081632653061586,0.0004081632653061586,0.0004081632653061586,0.0004081632653061586,0.0004081632653061586,0.0004081632653061586,0.0004081632653061586,0.0004081632653061586,0.0004081632653061586,0.0854328985026383,0.0004081632653061586,0.0004081632653061586,0.0004081632653061586,0.023479481676561286,0.046686749898586045,0.0004081632653061586,0.11245654023325449,0.0004081632653061586,0.0004081632653061586,0.0004081632653061586,0.0004081632653061586,0.02130911328907304,0.0004081632653061586,0.0004081632653061586,0.06396600920984728,0.0004081632653061586,0.0004081632653061586,0.0004081632653061586,0.0004081632653061586,0.0004081632653061586,0.0004081632653061586,0.03918769054211722,0.0004081632653061586,0.2225268434363658,0.0004081632653061586,0.0004081632653061586,0.03716768868048223,0.0004081632653061586,0.0004081632653061586,0.0004081632653061586,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0

46727,0,"I thought this movie was a lot better than most movie critics are giving it credit for . Though it has its confusing parts of the plot , it does n't greatly interfere with your understanding of the movie . That being said , If you 're not open to more liberal political ideas , then this probably is n't the movie for you . I thought all the actors in the movie were outstanding . Each character has their funny moments and the audience at the Tribeca Film Festival was laughing throughout the whole thing . I thought the satire was a tad over the top in one particular area , but that 's intentionally done . John Cusack is right in that although it 's set in the future , it really makes you see the present .",140,1,0.0006896551724138357,0.0006896551724138357,0.0006896551724138357,0.0006896551724138357,0.0006896551724138357,0.0006896551724138357,0.0006896551724138357,0.0006896551724138357,0.0006896551724138357,0.0006896551724138357,0.0006896551724138357,0.0006896551724138357,0.0006896551724138357,0.0006896551724138357,0.0006896551724138357,0.0006896551724138357,0.0006896551724138357,0.0006896551724138357,0.0006896551724138357,0.0006896551724138357,0.6680850641261523,0.22570788118803797,0.0006896551724138357,0.0006896551724138357,0.0006896551724138357,0.07379326158235967,0.0006896551724138357,0.0006896551724138357,0.0006896551724138357,0.0006896551724138357,0.0006896551724138357,0.0006896551724138357,0.0006896551724138357,0.0006896551724138357,0.0006896551724138357,0.0006896551724138357,0.0006896551724138357,0.0006896551724138357,0.0006896551724138357,0.0006896551724138357,0.0006896551724138357,0.0006896551724138357,0.0006896551724138357,0.0006896551724138357,0.0006896551724138357,0.0006896551724138357,0.0006896551724138357,0.0006896551724138357,0.0006896551724138357,0.0006896551724138357,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

46843,0,"Louis Sachar 's compelling children 's classic is about as Disney as Freddy Krueger . It 's got murder , racism , facial disfigurement and killer lizards . Tightly plotted , it 's a multi - layered , interlinking story that spans history to reveal Stanley 's own heritage and the secret behind the holes . It races from Latvia 's lush greenness to the pock - marked Camp Green Lake ( hint : there 's no lake and no green).Disney 's first success is re - creating the novel 's environments so convincingly - the set design is superb and without gloss . The other plus is in the casting . Rising star Shia LaBeouf ( Charlie 's Angels 2 , Project Greenlight ) might not be the fat boy of the book , but his attitude is right and he 's far from the usual clean - cut hero . The rest of the cast is filled out equally well , from Patricia Arquette as the Frontier school marm - turned - bank robber to Henry Winkler as Stanley 's dad . The downside is the pop soundtrack - pure marketing department - and having the sentiment turned up to full volume at the end .",208,1,0.0008333333333334039,0.24967253877064483,0.0008333333333334039,0.0008333333333334039,0.0008333333333334039,0.0008333333333334039,0.0008333333333334039,0.0008333333333334039,0.05402352830569061,0.0008333333333334039,0.0008333333333334039,0.0008333333333334039,0.0008333333333334039,0.0008333333333334039,0.0008333333333334039,0.0008333333333334039,0.0008333333333334039,0.0008333333333334039,0.0008333333333334039,0.0008333333333334039,0.0008333333333334039,0.0008333333333334039,0.0008333333333334039,0.0008333333333334039,0.04305987028506054,0.07989375067650673,0.17634306174364517,0.0008333333333334039,0.0008333333333334039,0.0008333333333334039,0.0008333333333334039,0.042085491752785364,0.13668429793548872,0.0008333333333334039,0.0751895180311126,0.0008333333333334039,0.10888127583239607,0.0008333333333334039,0.0008333333333334039,0.0008333333333334039,0.0008333333333334039,0.0008333333333334039,0.0008333333333334039,0.0008333333333334039,0.0008333333333334039,0.0008333333333334039,0.0008333333333334039,0.0008333333333334039,0.0008333333333334039,0.0008333333333334039,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
46923,0,""" The Invisible Mouse "" is a delightful and different Tom & Jerry 's cartoon . It features the usual cat / mouse chases and battles , but in a different way this time . Jerry accidentally falls in a bottle of invisible ink and is obviously very glad about this because he realizes that he can prepare lots of "" surprises "" for Tom , scare him , torment him and confuse him . As much as it is weird , it 's also very cool and funny to see what we ca n't see : Jerry invisible . It 's amusing to see things lifting up in the air without seeing who 's doing it ( we know who , right ? ) - it 's like those things had a life of their own or even almost like a matter of ghosts . It 's equally amusing to see Jerry eating some candies and fruits while he 's invisible . I really like that instrumental music which plays when he 's not visible . Some of the best jokes on this short are when Tom sees Jerry 's shadow and slams him and even when Tom tries to slam him with a frying pan and Jerry writes "" Missed me "" . I also like when Jerry drinks Tom 's chocolate milk , becoming visible again and with a happy look on his face . Overall , this short has the basic ingredients needed for a classic cartoon : humor , entertainment , fun and some nice artwork too .",263,1,0.000512820512820559,0.07376603512334864,0.000512820512820559,0.000512820512820559,0.000512820512820559,0.000512820512820559,0.032625702330940115,0.000512820512820559,0.000512820512820559,0.000512820512820559,0.000512820512820559,0.000512820512820559,0.000512820512820559,0.000512820512820559,0.000512820512820559,0.000512820512820559,0.000512820512820559,0.000512820512820559,0.000512820512820559,0.000512820512820559,0.5147063022953691,0.000512820512820559,0.06378951006511858,0.000512820512820559,0.040933451199806806,0.000512820512820559,0.05344390144708615,0.000512820512820559,0.000512820512820559,0.000512820512820559,0.000512820512820559,0.000512820512820559,0.000512820512820559,0.000512820512820559,0.000512820512820559,0.000512820512820559,0.000512820512820559,0.000512820512820559,0.0346092222880735,0.000512820512820559,0.000512820512820559,0.000512820512820559,0.000512820512820559,0.000512820512820559,0.000512820512820559,0.12861575965854097,0.03648447456607319,0.000512820512820559,0.000512820512820559,0.000512820512820559,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0
46926,0,"I have n't read through all the comments , but at least one poster mentioned that the 30 minute version might possibly be abridged . I 'm curious about that myself because the later parts of the film just did n't make much sense to me even when I rewatched them . 30 minutes seems really short for a movie in 1917 also . "" Poor Little Rich Girl "" which was Tourneur 's next film is 65 minutes long and "" Pride of the Clan "" which was his previous feature was 84 minutes long . So I 'm relieved to see that I was n't crazy , there must be part of this film missing and that 's why the resolution did n't make much sense . It 's hard to review or comment on a movie that you 're only able to see half of ... but I would recommend this film anyway because of the really fascinating view that it provides us of the insides of an East Coast movie studio of the time . It 's the earliest film I 've personally seen that 's based on the movie industry itself . The main character is a movie star played by Robert Warwick , who was later a mainstay Hollywood character actor and appeared in almost all of Preston Sturges ' films . He plays a western actor perhaps vaguely modeled on William S. Hart , who Warwick does resemble somewhat . After the really fascinating sequences set in the studio we see them on a location shoot where he discovers a country girl ( Doris Kenyon ) and convinces her to come to New Jersey for a screen test which goes very poorly . After that point the movie seems to be missing major pieces in the form we have now . Again , I 'd recommend it to anyone who 's interested in film history for the documentary value , but in the form we have it does n't hold up much as a movie and is n't a particularly good example of Maurice Tourneur 's work .",355,1,0.00025000000000002315,0.00025000000000002315,0.02270737943847129,0.00025000000000002315,0.00025000000000002315,0.00025000000000002315,0.00025000000000002315,0.00025000000000002315,0.020013608699550208,0.00025000000000002315,0.00025000000000002315,0.02051841507477722,0.00025000000000002315,0.00025000000000002315,0.012728408848763336,0.00025000000000002315,0.00025000000000002315,0.00025000000000002315,0.06273320109875721,0.00025000000000002315,0.2383428533982216,0.07406679528353738,0.00025000000000002315,0.00025000000000002315,0.00025000000000002315,0.00025000000000002315,0.09077368889267391,0.00025000000000002315,0.00025000000000002315,0.00025000000000002315,0.00025000000000002315,0.01361481417781916,0.00025000000000002315,0.00025000000000002315,0.022002549319548707,0.00025000000000002315,0.02130911716374033,0.00025000000000002315,0.00025000000000002315,0.00025000000000002315,0.00025000000000002315,0.00025000000000002315,0.00025000000000002315,0.35904906639496686,0.03289010220917211,0.00025000000000002315,0.00025000000000002315,0.00025000000000002315,0.00025000000000002315,0.00025000000000002315,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0
47171,0,"* * Warning - this post may contain spoilers * * I only got a Gamecube in September 2005 , and the first two games I bought were James Bond games , the decent Agent Under Fire and the dull Goldeneye Rogue Agent . The next game I planned to get was Everything or Nothing , because my friend told me that it was better than the two games I already had . I have to say , he was right . I bought this for a tenner in HMV , and when I got home , I slammed it in to my Cube and played it for hours on end . It was much better than my other two games , and there was a much better and more interesting storyline . Graphics were some of the best I have seen ( but now that the XBOX 360 has come out , Farcry Instincts Predator has some of the best graphics known to man ) . The storyline was clever ; mad man ( Willem Dafoe , named as Nikolai Diavolo ) and beautiful henchwoman ( Heidi Klum , named as Katya Nadanova ) , try to destroy the world with tiny nanobots , which at the start of the game , you , James Bond , have to destroy on a train . The bad thing is that one of them is hidden in Katya 's boobs . You then have to thwart their plans and save the world . The great thing about this game is that it actually has actors voicing the characters , such as Cleese voicing Q. There are 27 levels , some of them short and some of them pretty long and tricky .

47341,0,"It 's not well shot , well written or well acted but it has to be the most addictive show I 've seen since Twin Peaks . Every single revelation is timed so well that you have to see the next episode to get any kind of closure . They have even slowed down the pace of the show where they only reveal tiny amounts of information per episode however it feels like they 've just told you everything you wanted to know . However some of the acting is just about awful and some of the duologue is downright brutal . Some characters are very two dimensional . The more experienced actors like Locke and Ecko really stand out over actors who play Jack , Kate , Sayid and so on . The development of the show can also be very frustrating as the following episode may not show what the previous episode lead up to . Annoying side plots have become part of the story that sometimes tell you nothing . However , the second season has developed to a point where back stories reveal more about the island than they had previously . All in all its a great show but not perfect .",207,1,0.0005405405405405949,0.0005405405405405949,0.0005405405405405949,0.0005405405405405949,0.0005405405405405949,0.0005405405405405949,0.0005405405405405949,0.0005405405405405949,0.03716792710840643,0.0005405405405405949,0.0005405405405405949,0.0005405405405405949,0.29567863832687735,0.0005405405405405949,0.0005405405405405949,0.0005405405405405949,0.0005405405405405949,0.0005405405405405949,0.0005405405405405949,0.0005405405405405949,0.29715682405509114,0.0005405405405405949,0.0005405405405405949,0.0005405405405405949,0.0005405405405405949,0.0005405405405405949,0.0005405405405405949,0.0005405405405405949,0.0005405405405405949,0.0005405405405405949,0.0005405405405405949,0.0005405405405405949,0.0005405405405405949,0.0005405405405405949,0.08616222974141023,0.16213818005519248,0.0005405405405405949,0.0005405405405405949,0.0005405405405405949,0.0005405405405405949,0.035738244673355575,0.0005405405405405949,0.0005405405405405949,0.0005405405405405949,0.0005405405405405949,0.06271471279642118,0.0005405405405405949,0.0005405405405405949,0.0005405405405405949,0.0005405405405405949,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
47414,0,"The movie "" Holly "" is the story of a young girl who has been sold by her poor family and smuggled across the border to Cambodia to work as a prostitute in the infamous "" K11 "" red light village . In the movie , Holly is waiting to be sold at a premium for her virginity when she meets Patrick who is losing money and friends through gambling and bar fights . Patrick and Holly have an immediate bond over their "" stubbornness "" , but this is all disrupted when Holly is sold to a child trafficker and disappears . As movie goers , we are then thrust into Patrick 's pursuit to find Holly again . Holly then shows her willingness to leave this lifestyle but her confusion on what is right and wrong . "" Holly "" carries us through the beautiful and harsh Cambodia while discovering that HOLLY is not just one girl . She is the voice of millions of children who are exploited and violated every year with no rights or protection . Holly is less extreme than its subject matter might suggest , such as documentaries that involve 4-year olds and sexual trafficking , but does manage to shed considerable light on Cambodian / Vietnamese trafficking of children into prostitution . It is a moving story that helps to shed light on the horrible situation in which many children face and their struggles to trust and realize what is right and wrong . Patrick , the antagonist of the film is an American dealer of stolen artifacts who is also losing money and friends while playing cards and getting into bar fights . While on a journey , his motorbike runs out of fuel , and he is forced to rent a room at a brothel . During his stay he comes across Holly , a twelve year old girl who has been sold by her parents and is being abducted into slavery and prostitution . Holly and Patrick begin a friendship of trust and understanding . He discovers a clever , stubborn girl beneath the traumatized exterior and becomes determined to save her -- though their strictly platonic relationship is misinterpreted by almost everyone they meet . When she suddenly disappears , he starts a journey to track her down , without having thought if he can really help her . Holly is able to escape on her way to another brothel , when she jumps from the truck and runs into a field filled with mines . A mine is set off by a cow and the truck driver believes she is dead , so Holly is then left on her own . During Patrick 's journey to find holly he meets a social worker who tries to talk some sense into him and shares the facts with him that haunts the Cambodian region . The idea of paying for her freedom simply fuels the demand , she explains : 30,000 children in prostitution in Cambodia - next year it could be 60,000 . "" I 'm not trying to save 60,000 , "" he tells her , "" I 'm trying to save one . "" Patrick discovers that the idea of whisking her to safety is quickly put to rest when the social worker tells him that the US will not let him adopt and , although it takes five minutes to ' save ' a child , it takes five years to reintegrate her into society . Patrick is not affected by the information and he continues his quest to find Holly . The audience is then shown that Holly makes it to a small town and is foraging for food with other homeless children . She is then befriended by a local policemen who seem little better than criminals with a badge , when they sell her to another brothel and then make a deal to a Vietnamese businessman who then takes her virginity . Holly then seems to think that this is her destiny and when Patrick finally find her , she is willing to "" yum yum "" and "" boom boom "" her distant friend . Patrick is utterly confused by this change in behavior , but he is not deterred in his plan to take her away from this world . In the end , he steals her away and brings her to a safe - land in the comfort of the social worker . Holly is given fresh clothes , if feed and brought to a dance class , but she is forbidden to see Patrick . This intense yearning to be in the comfort of Patrick 's friendship , she runs away from the safe house and back onto the streets in Cambodia . Meanwhile , Patrick is dealing with the decision to leave the country and flee back to the United States or to stay in Cambodia . His thoughts continue to revert back to Holly and during a visit to a bar ; an older male sees the picture he is holding and comments on his sexual appetite when he had sex with her . This enrages Patrick and he hits the man and runs out of the bar . Eventually , Patrick is caught by the police in the eyes of Holly , who is hiding behind a pole . The movie "" Holly "" may make the audience want to donate money towards organizations that improve the life for these poor youngsters , and even campaign to reduce the amount of brothels in the region , but the film 's dramatic weaknesses may reduce its chances of being seen by enough people to make a difference . Overall , I think the concept is better as a documentary and it was not as touching as a movie . The actors did a great job of showing their raw emotion and the true confusion of the youngsters who are affected by this lifestyle , but in the end , the harsh lifestyle of the region and the desperate notions of the parents who sell their children to uphold their own starvation , does nothing to help the children 's situations .",1045,1,0.15305562107493134,0.10882991077759908,0.014986612660010218,0.00015151515151517014,0.00015151515151517014,0.00015151515151517014,0.00015151515151517014,0.07457508850569601,0.03618388560776766,0.00015151515151517014,0.00015151515151517014,0.00015151515151517014,0.00015151515151517014,0.00015151515151517014,0.00015151515151517014,0.00015151515151517014,0.00015151515151517014,0.00015151515151517014,0.015288898503192939,0.009725587509802597,0.21794762596250963,0.00015151515151517014,0.00015151515151517014,0.0445620905508523,0.03552815247029809,0.0075819147144706705,0.00015151515151517014,0.00015151515151517014,0.00015151515151517014,0.015083106140085798,0.00015151515151517014,0.00812279728036339,0.00015151515151517014,0.00015151515151517014,0.11955076496238431,0.00015151515151517014,0.00015151515151517014,0.00015151515151517014,0.00015151515151517014,0.08540161894182811,0.007446582688472826,0.01741578181666044,0.00015151515151517014,0.02386547498458913,0.00015151515151517014,0.00015151515151517014,0.00015151515151517014,0.00015151515151517014,0.00015151515151517014,0.00015151515151517014,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
47424,0,"Holly addresses the issue of child sexploitation that is rampant all over the world ( some 2 million children are trafficked every year ) and does so sensitively and without manipulation -- a tall order that the team at Priority Films does with great success . American actor Ron Livington stars in the film alongside newcomer Thuy Nguyen , a Vietnamese actress who plays Holly , and together they bring to screen what is commonplace to the people at the notorious k11 redlight district in Cambodia . Although it tackles a heavy topic , the film holds on to moments of laughter and hope as we get to know the characters up close , keeping the two - hour film from being one that is too difficult to watch .

47859,0,"A brilliant portrait of a traitor ( Victor McLaglen in Oscar winning performance ) who is hounded by his own conscience . McLaglen plays an IRA rouge who betrays his leader to collect a reward during Ireland 's Sinn Fein Rebellion . The scenes showing fights and mob actions are very realistic , focusing on the desperation within individuals . The lack of hope for a better future seems to be a fate worse than death . Director John Ford superbly creates an murky and tense atmosphere , enhanced by the foggy and grimy depiction of the Irish landscape . Max Steiner 's dramatic music score adds to the cinematic delight . Oscar Winner also for Best Screenplay , nominated for Best Picture .

48199,0,""" The Matador "" is a dark comedy starring Pierce Brosnan as an aging hit man who befriends a straight - arrow , happily - married American businessman ( Greg Kinnear ) in Mexico . Although the sardonic Julian ( ironically surnamed "" Noble "" ) appears to be a "" tough guy "" on the surface , underneath he is really just a mass of neuroses and insecurities , a man who realizes that his chosen profession has left him virtually alone in the world and friendless . Thus on his birthday , he reaches out to Danny , a man who has lived his life playing by the rules and who becomes strangely intrigued by Julian 's "" unconventional "" lifestyle . In fact , both men find in each other the person they could never be but wish they could become in their quieter , franker moments of self - evaluation . Although the film is a bit too reminiscent of "" Analyze This "" and "" Midnight Run "" to feel entirely fresh and original , "" The Matador , "" nevertheless , earns points for the complexity of its characters and the quality of its acting . Brosnan , looking aged and almost used up , sinks his teeth into the role of Julian in a way he never has before . Playing a man who seems constitutionally unable to make a serious connection with another human being , Brosnan is flip and cavalier one moment , then genuine and sympathetic the next . He always keeps us off balance so that the humor never becomes crass or stale . Kinnear is also excellent as the Regular Joe businessman who finds himself pulled ever more to the Dark Side as his relationship with Julian deepens . Hope Davis does a fine job as "" Bean , "" Danny 's loyal and loving wife who , like her husband , finds herself intrigued by this mysterious and "" dangerous "" figure from a world far different from the one she knows . At times , we find ourselves feeling that "" The Matador "" is holding something back from us , not quite plumbing the depths of its situation and premise . At the end it feels a little too light , a little too insubstantial to register the impact it should . This could be because this is the feature film debut for writer / director Richard Shephard , and he has n't quite gotten his movie pacing down yet . Still , one appreciates the fact that he does n't always go for the obvious and that he keeps tightly focused on the two main figures in the piece , rarely settling for the trite setup or the easy laugh . 'The Matador "" is a flawed but generally entertaining little comedy that will , hopefully , signal a new phase in Brosnan 's acting career .",493,1,0.00027777777777780483,0.04995645411699933,0.014521235436028491,0.00027777777777780483,0.00027777777777780483,0.00027777777777780483,0.00027777777777780483,0.2562370093977643,0.057828298099212194,0.00027777777777780483,0.00027777777777780483,0.00027777777777780483,0.00027777777777780483,0.00027777777777780483,0.010468236591389379,0.00027777777777780483,0.00027777777777780483,0.00027777777777780483,0.00027777777777780483,0.00027777777777780483,0.23208282898315022,0.00027777777777780483,0.00027777777777780483,0.00027777777777780483,0.00027777777777780483,0.00027777777777780483,0.00027777777777780483,0.00027777777777780483,0.00027777777777780483,0.00027777777777780483,0.00027777777777780483,0.020647836024705324,0.00027777777777780483,0.00027777777777780483,0.00027777777777780483,0.00027777777777780483,0.00027777777777780483,0.00027777777777780483,0.06520940666734024,0.00027777777777780483,0.00027777777777780483,0.00027777777777780483,0.00027777777777780483,0.24452128983453397,0.00027777777777780483,0.00027777777777780483,0.03741629373776438,0.00027777777777780483,0.00027777777777780483,0.00027777777777780483,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0
48547,0,"I was pretty young when this came out in the US , but I recorded it from TV and watched it over and over again until I had the whole thing memorized . To this day I still catch myself quoting it . The show itself was hilarious and had many famous characters , from Frank Sinatra , to Sylvester Stallone , to Mr. T. The voices were great , and sounded just like the characters they were portraying . The puppets were also well done , although a little creepy . I was surprised to find out just recently that it was written by Rob Grant and Doug Naylor of Red Dwarf , a show that I also enjoy very much . Like another person had written in a comment earlier , I too was robbed of this great show by a "" friend "" who borrowed it and never returned it . I sure wish there was enough demand for this show to warrant a DVD release , but I do n't think enough people have heard of it .

48679,0,"Eleven different Film Makers from different parts of the world are assembled in this film to present their views and ideas about the WTC attack . This is one of the best effort you will see in any Film . Films like this are rarely made and appreciated . This film tries to touch every possible core of WTC . Here are some of the most important stories from the film that makes this film so unique . There is the story from Samira Makhmalbaf ( Iran ) where somewhere in Iran people are preparing for the attacks from America . There a teacher is trying to educate her students by informing them about Innocent People being killed in WTC massacre . Then comes a story from Youssef Chahine ( Egypt ) where a Film Maker comes across face - to - face conversation with a Dead Soldier in the WTC attack and a Dead Hard Core Terrorist who was involved in WTC attack . Then we see a story from Idrissa Ouedraogo ( Burkina Faso ) where a group of Five Innocent children 's sees Osama Bin Laden and plans to kidnap him and win the reward money from America . Then we see the story from Alejandro Gozalez Inarritu ( Mexico ) where you see a Black Screen and slowly you see the real footage of WTC buildings coming down . And the people who are stuck in the building are jumping out of it to save their lives . The other most important story is from Mira Nair ( India ) where a mother is struggling to get respect for her Dead Son whose name is falsely trapped in WTC massacre ! After September 11 attack , Our heart beat automatically starts pumping if we hear two names anywhere in the world .. First is World Trade Centre and the second is Osama ! This film totally changes our perception and makes a strong point by claiming something more to it . I will definitely recommend this movie to everyone who loves to have such kinds of Home DVD Collection . Definitely worth every penny you spend . But please do n't expect anything more apart from Films in this DVD . There is of course Filmographies of the Film Makers but No Extra Features .",389,1,0.0002857142857143151,0.0002857142857143151,0.0002857142857143151,0.0002857142857143151,0.0002857142857143151,0.0002857142857143151,0.0002857142857143151,0.16705642611759391,0.0002857142857143151,0.0002857142857143151,0.0002857142857143151,0.01326102930284475,0.0002857142857143151,0.0002857142857143151,0.0002857142857143151,0.0002857142857143151,0.0002857142857143151,0.02969526550952621,0.0002857142857143151,0.0002857142857143151,0.027180132407125284,0.0002857142857143151,0.0002857142857143151,0.0002857142857143151,0.0002857142857143151,0.0002857142857143151,0.0002857142857143151,0.0002857142857143151,0.0002857142857143151,0.0002857142857143151,0.0002857142857143151,0.0002857142857143151,0.0002857142857143151,0.0002857142857143151,0.22538084745125778,0.04146781067096216,0.0002857142857143151,0.0002857142857143151,0.0002857142857143151,0.0743351384282686,0.0002857142857143151,0.09467358518292886,0.0002857142857143151,0.31523547921520556,0.0002857142857143151,0.0002857142857143151,0.0002857142857143151,0.0002857142857143151,0.0002857142857143151,0.0002857142857143151,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

When Gillian sets her eyes on Shep Henderson,(James Stewart ) who is engaged to a girl he is going to marry ; Gillian performers some magic spells with a cat and changes his mind about his intended bride and then becomes very lust full and falls in love with Gillian . The story tells that a real witch can not fall in love , blush or cry and this begins to prove a big problem between Shep and Gillian , so Nick and Aunt Queenie decided they have to do something about this situation . Great film to view over and over again and a great classic film from 1958 .",164,1,0.0008000000000000716,0.0008000000000000716,0.0008000000000000716,0.0008000000000000716,0.07543665997765668,0.0008000000000000716,0.0008000000000000716,0.0008000000000000716,0.0008000000000000716,0.0008000000000000716,0.0008000000000000716,0.0008000000000000716,0.0008000000000000716,0.0008000000000000716,0.0008000000000000716,0.0008000000000000716,0.0008000000000000716,0.0008000000000000716,0.0008000000000000716,0.0008000000000000716,0.0008000000000000716,0.0008000000000000716,0.03575474224554491,0.0008000000000000716,0.09824381287416012,0.0689990409655204,0.0008000000000000716,0.0008000000000000716,0.0008000000000000716,0.030864170128280737,0.0008000000000000716,0.0008000000000000716,0.0008000000000000716,0.0008000000000000716,0.09269555031718833,0.0008000000000000716,0.0008000000000000716,0.0008000000000000716,0.0008000000000000716,0.0008000000000000716,0.0008000000000000716,0.0008000000000000716,0.0008000000000000716,0.48776659340648687,0.07663943008515882,0.0008000000000000716,0.0008000000000000716,0.0008000000000000716,0.0008000000000000716,0.0008000000000000716,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0
48858,0,"I saw this film when I was a young child on television ( thank - you Canadian Broadcasting Corporation ) and had nightmares about it for years afterwards . Trnka was one of the mentors for Bratislav Pojar , one of Canada 's National Film Board 's best animators . Pojar was , in turn a mentor and collaborator for the great Drouin . If you like Trnka you should see "" Night Angel"" . The symbolism is obvious , but deftly used . The oppositions of beauty and life ( the plant ) are placed in opposition with the anonymity of the gloved hand . The poor puppet hero is condemned despite a lack of political agenda . What I most remembered was the feeling of oppression in the decor . The small room where the action takes place is the character 's entire world . The invasion by the hand is a complete violation of that world . Beautiful and haunting film . I found a copy of this and other wonderful shorts by Trnka at the public library and showed it to my own kids .

49092,0,"This wonderful 1983 BBC television production ( not a movie , as others have written here ) of the classic love story "" Jane Eyre "" , starring Timothy Dalton as Rochester , and Zelah Clarke as Jane , is the finest version that has been made to date , since it is the most faithful to the novel by Charlotte Bronte in both concept and dialogue . A classic becomes a classic for very specific reasons ; when film producers start to meddle with a classic 's very lifeblood then that classic is destroyed . Thankfully the producers of THIS "" Jane Eyre "" approached the story with respect and faithfulness towards the original , which results in a spectacularly addictive concoction that is worth viewing multiple times , to enjoy its multi - layers of sweetness and delight and suspense . The performances are delightful , the music is just right , even the Gothic design of the house and outdoor shots are beautiful , and set the right tone for the production . My only criticism , though slight , is that this version , like every other version ever made of Jane Eyre , ignores the Christian influences that built Jane 's character and influenced her moral choices . In today 's modern world a woman in Jane 's situation would n't think twice but to stay with Rochester after finding out he had an insane wife and was still married to her . "" Oh , just get a divorce "" , she would say to her man , or she would live in sin with him . But Jane Eyre knew she could n't settle for this course in life and respect herself . Why ? This decision was based on the foundations of the Christian faith she had been taught since childhood , not from the brutal Calvinist Lowood Institution , but from the Christian example of a true friend , Helen Burns , who was martyred rather than not turn the other cheek . Someday I would like to see some version depict these influences a little more fully in an adaptation . A classic novel that ends with the heroine writing "" Even so , come Lord Jesus ! "" should not have the foundations of that faith stripped out of it .",392,1,0.0003225806451613166,0.07793432843091458,0.0003225806451613166,0.0003225806451613166,0.0003225806451613166,0.0003225806451613166,0.0003225806451613166,0.11704147156455341,0.12507750826882708,0.0003225806451613166,0.0003225806451613166,0.016446783925071224,0.0003225806451613166,0.0003225806451613166,0.0003225806451613166,0.0003225806451613166,0.0003225806451613166,0.0003225806451613166,0.0003225806451613166,0.028222866244087808,0.24799143382156524,0.0003225806451613166,0.0003225806451613166,0.0003225806451613166,0.0003225806451613166,0.04512888185208602,0.0842996185049277,0.0003225806451613166,0.0003225806451613166,0.0003225806451613166,0.0003225806451613166,0.0003225806451613166,0.0003225806451613166,0.0003225806451613166,0.0003225806451613166,0.0003225806451613166,0.09351678160028282,0.0003225806451613166,0.0003225806451613166,0.0003225806451613166,0.0003225806451613166,0.0003225806451613166,0.0003225806451613166,0.15143709998123148,0.0003225806451613166,0.0003225806451613166,0.0003225806451613166,0.0003225806451613166,0.0003225806451613166,0.0003225806451613166,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

( not in that perverted way ! ) To her surprise he agrees and from then on he is known as Momo , her pet .",158,1,0.24457765394929534,0.05825607098061881,0.0009090909090909827,0.0009090909090909827,0.0009090909090909827,0.0009090909090909827,0.0009090909090909827,0.0009090909090909827,0.0009090909090909827,0.0009090909090909827,0.0009090909090909827,0.0009090909090909827,0.0009090909090909827,0.0009090909090909827,0.0009090909090909827,0.0009090909090909827,0.0009090909090909827,0.0009090909090909827,0.0009090909090909827,0.0009090909090909827,0.0009090909090909827,0.0009090909090909827,0.0009090909090909827,0.0009090909090909827,0.12467571297883358,0.0009090909090909827,0.052568991367312454,0.0009090909090909827,0.0009090909090909827,0.0009090909090909827,0.0009090909090909827,0.0009090909090909827,0.0009090909090909827,0.0009090909090909827,0.19564369494415812,0.0009090909090909827,0.0009090909090909827,0.0009090909090909827,0.0009090909090909827,0.0009090909090909827,0.0009090909090909827,0.0009090909090909827,0.0009090909090909827,0.0009090909090909827,0.0009090909090909827,0.28427787577977864,0.0009090909090909827,0.0009090909090909827,0.0009090909090909827,0.0009090909090909827,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,1
49472,0,"ROAD TO PERDITION can be summed up by Thomas Newman 's score . It 's haunting and beautiful but you 're aware that this music is similar to Newman 's other work and while listening to the soundtrack you 're reminded of SCENT OF A WOMAN , MEETING JOE BLACK and THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION you 're reminded of other films as the story unfolds on screen . As the Sullivans drive round America trying to escape from a psychotic hit man you think of THE GETAWAY , Irish gangsters is MILLER 'S CROSSING whilst the subtext of guilt and redemption can be summed up by Coppola and Leone 's gangster epics . Despite having a seen it all before feel this should n't be taken as a heavy criticism of Sam Mendes film which I repeat is haunting and beautiful and the only flaws that work against it is a very slow opening twenty minutes and I was slightly confused as the events that caused Michael Sullivan to be betrayed . But if you stop to consider how much of a sentimental mess Spielberg might have made with the story that revolves around a father and his twelve year old son running for their lives you ca n't help thinking what a superb director Mendes is ROAD TO PERDITION is a film where the entire cast give flawless performances . I 've never been all that keen on Tom Hanks but he 's every bit as good here as he has been in any starring role , probably better . Paul Newman plays a character with an Irish accent but at no point did I believe I was watching an American screen legend putting on a false accent - Newman 's performance works due to the subtle body language , his character is torn up by guilt but Newman never milks it or goes over the top . While never upstaging Newman who gives the best performance in the movie the two Brit supporting actors Craig and Law are also very memorable as American gangsters and while Law will still have a long career as a leading actor one wonders how Daniel Craig might have progressed as a character actor if he had n't decided to become James Bond , a role which heralds the end of an actors career",390,1,0.08840037443946268,0.00027027027027030134,0.00027027027027030134,0.00027027027027030134,0.00027027027027030134,0.00027027027027030134,0.00027027027027030134,0.06054631981404169,0.06983940401598841,0.00027027027027030134,0.00027027027027030134,0.00027027027027030134,0.08886309049964831,0.00027027027027030134,0.01378378377339466,0.00027027027027030134,0.00027027027027030134,0.00027027027027030134,0.013775385159045687,0.00027027027027030134,0.09336047038722123,0.00027027027027030134,0.00027027027027030134,0.00027027027027030134,0.00027027027027030134,0.00027027027027030134,0.00027027027027030134,0.00027027027027030134,0.00027027027027030134,0.012828011028274217,0.00027027027027030134,0.028063572473686904,0.00027027027027030134,0.00027027027027030134,0.00027027027027030134,0.020582324326293887,0.00027027027027030134,0.013841330802461766,0.00027027027027030134,0.00027027027027030134,0.00027027027027030134,0.04399992710127985,0.00027027027027030134,0.4421160061791997,0.00027027027027030134,0.00027027027027030134,0.00027027027027030134,0.00027027027027030134,0.00027027027027030134,0.00027027027027030134,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
49489,0,"Most of the feedback I 've heard concerning Meatball Machine has been pretty mixed . A couple even saying that they think "" it sucked "" . Well , to those people I say , get some f@ckin imagination and go f@ck yourself . This was a very entertaining flick . The story starts with this mechanical bug which attacks and somehow transforms its hosts into these Gwar - costume looking , deathbots called Necroborgs . Eventually you learn that these mechanical bugs also attach a little parasite onto you , which then is able to control your actions due to hot - wiring your nervous system . Unfortunately for two love - seeking lonely young adults , they happen to cross paths with the mechanical bug , and before you know it transformations are taking place and blood is being splattered . Is there a way to stop the transformation ? Maybe a way to stop this mechanical bug threat ? Why do the Necroborgs fight one another ? Do the two desperate singles get to express their feelings for one another and do the nasty ? Only one way to find out . Going into Meatball Machine I was kinda wary due to the mixed reactions , but it turned out being a great surprise . A few unanswered questions , some average acting at times and a slightly confusing ending are the only weak points I can think of . From the anime feel to it , to the parasites becoming little characters themselves and even to the low budget feel , this movie hits the right mark much more than it misses . With a ever - developing story that 's interesting enough to keep oneself asking questions throughout mixed with the cool make - up effects and blood splatter , this is one flick fans of bizarro / horror / Tetsuo / splatter fans should check out . 8 outta 10",326,1,0.00036363636363640563,0.00036363636363640563,0.00036363636363640563,0.014552678390764223,0.07210126573950992,0.00036363636363640563,0.03997199736172888,0.00036363636363640563,0.00036363636363640563,0.00036363636363640563,0.00036363636363640563,0.029254854242043795,0.2298474450382095,0.00036363636363640563,0.00036363636363640563,0.00036363636363640563,0.00036363636363640563,0.00036363636363640563,0.00036363636363640563,0.00036363636363640563,0.24642561160410373,0.00036363636363640563,0.00036363636363640563,0.03764347208177053,0.00036363636363640563,0.00036363636363640563,0.00036363636363640563,0.00036363636363640563,0.00036363636363640563,0.00036363636363640563,0.00036363636363640563,0.00036363636363640563,0.04310568170288989,0.00036363636363640563,0.15648348496013764,0.00036363636363640563,0.00036363636363640563,0.00036363636363640563,0.00036363636363640563,0.00036363636363640563,0.00036363636363640563,0.00036363636363640563,0.025149354738944144,0.00036363636363640563,0.00036363636363640563,0.09128233595807785,0.00036363636363640563,0.00036363636363640563,0.00036363636363640563,0.00036363636363640563,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

49782,0,""" Batman : The Mystery of the Batwoman "" is about as entertaining as animated Batman movies get . While still true to the feeling of the comic books , the animation is done with a lighter spirit than in the animated series . Bruce Wayne looks much like he has before , but now he appears somewhat less imposing . The Dick Grayson Robin has been replaced by the less edgy , more youthful Tim Drake Robin . Kevin Conroy , as usual , invokes the voice of Batman better than most live action actors . Kelly Ripa did a much more decent voice - acting job than I was expecting . As in the live action Batman films , the movie lives or dies based on the quality of the villains . My all - time favorite , the Penguin , is here . His design is sleeker than it has appeared before , hearkening more to the Burgess Meredith portrayal of the ' 60 's than the Danny DeVito portrayal of "" Batman Returns . "" David Ogden Stiers is the perfect choice for the Penguin 's voice . The Penguin is finally portrayed as a cunning sophisticate , just as he most commonly appears in the comics . Hector Elizondo 's voice creates a Bane who 's much more memorable than the forgettable version in "" Batman & Robin . "" And finally , Batman has a descent mystery to solve , putting the "" Detective "" back in "" Detective Comics "" ( that is what "" DC "" stands for , after all . ) The revolution to the mystery is a delightfully sneaky twist . The score adds to the mysterious ambiance of the movie . It sounds like a mix between the score from "" Poirot "" and the score from "" Mission : Impossible . "" All in all , it 's more entertaining than your average cartoon .",328,1,0.0005128205128205577,0.0005128205128205577,0.02815714949544733,0.0005128205128205577,0.0005128205128205577,0.0005128205128205577,0.0005128205128205577,0.1360987176708119,0.23011997667515383,0.0005128205128205577,0.0005128205128205577,0.0005128205128205577,0.0005128205128205577,0.0005128205128205577,0.0005128205128205577,0.0005128205128205577,0.0005128205128205577,0.0005128205128205577,0.0005128205128205577,0.0005128205128205577,0.112115061533735,0.2519822174107205,0.0005128205128205577,0.05901503269886369,0.0005128205128205577,0.0005128205128205577,0.0005128205128205577,0.0005128205128205577,0.0005128205128205577,0.0005128205128205577,0.0005128205128205577,0.0005128205128205577,0.0005128205128205577,0.0005128205128205577,0.0005128205128205577,0.0005128205128205577,0.03819119052089851,0.0005128205128205577,0.0005128205128205577,0.0005128205128205577,0.0005128205128205577,0.0005128205128205577,0.0005128205128205577,0.12278219245590592,0.0005128205128205577,0.0005128205128205577,0.0005128205128205577,0.0005128205128205577,0.0005128205128205577,0.0005128205128205577,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
49800,0,"This is a very good , made for TV film . It depicts trouble in suburbia circa 1970 's and the sort of neighbors one certainly does not want to have around . The worst & most upsetting part of the film was when the punk teenagers killed the family dog . The teens do everything to annoy and harass this poor family . But boy ! , does the lead character take vengeance on those punk teenagers in the end . The father / homeowner surely does not take all of the aggravation from the punk teens lightly and is quick to retaliate after lack of help from the police that is . He stands up to them and protects his home and his family . A very good actor .. I might add . I watched this on TV when I was like 8 or 9 . I have never seen it again on TV and would like to . Definitely a good one ! It 's the sort of movie one may catch on a weekday night very late at night and ca n't stop watching or an afternoon film on a weekend . It 's the kind they just do n't show anymore .

The story is basically an animated version of Three Men and a Baby , set 20,000 years in the past . The visuals were great . Simply beautiful . It 's one thing to create convincing aninmation , it 's another thing altogether to create visually arresting stuff and Ice Age is great to look at with its stylized visuals .

In retrospect this means no one is prepared to recommend the book after they have read it .

50099,1,"Just plain dumb I am having a hard time understanding why people have raved about this book . I guess everyone is entitled to have loyal fans , but I just do n't see what was great , or even good , about this story . Two teenagers enter a school and end up killing seven people . They are caught , they confess , and the Grandmother of one of the killers hires Spenser to prove the boy 's innocense . We are given the impression a great mystery , with possible red herrings , is about to entertain us . Alas , it is not to be . The kids did it , plain and simple . Why they did it is so stupid . The story reads as though a sixth grader has written it . The plot is lame , and even as lame as it is , it is n't executed well at all . The characters are boring and 2 dimensional . The banter which takes place between the main character and others , while it seems to be trying to be witty , is just dumb and unbelievable . I just ca n't say enough about how stupid this story is . There are too many wonderful mystery authors out there writing gripping , intense works of fiction to waste your time on this one .

50113,1,"Definitely not Alcott 's "" Little Women "" I started reading this book expecting to like it - it 's historical , related to Little Women , won the Pulitzer , does n't feel like fluff , etc . However I had a really difficult time getting into the book . For one , the language sounded much more pretentious than historically accurate . I 've read other works from the time period she 's supposed to be writing in , and rather than feeling in keeping with that era , this book felt indicitive of someone who makes full use of her thesaurus . Also , I have n't read her other book so i did n't enter this novel with a trust for the author . Consequentally , I found that as she mentioned connections to Little Women , I became defensive . She had not proven to me that she had the right to use this work . In some of her character choices , such as one of the first encounters between March and Marmee ( I 'm not going to go into details so as not to spoil the scene ) , I believe that she made a radical departure from anything that Alcott would have written of her characters , and that Brooks really did not stay true to the original . The first half of the book is also really dry . This could just be my personal taste , but the first half moved so slowly ! The book started to pick up about half way through . Overall , the story being told and the Civil War aspects were n't bad , and could be a decent story in their own right if she 'd just speed things along at the beginning . However , I think Brooks did the book a major disservice by linking it to Little Women . I bristled every time she mentioned an individual from the book , because she was really changing their characters ( other than Aunt March ) . The choices that Brooks ' characters made were not in keeping with choices they may have made in Alcott 's book . In the afterward , Brooks discussed her research and how she actually based the March family and particularly Mr. March more on the Alcott family itself than on the characters from Little Women , even commenting how the March Family in Alcott 's book is n't very interesting , and how "" Nobody in real life is such a goody - goody as that Marmee . "" If she felt that way , then why use them as the basis for her book ? Seen in that context , her earlier * huge * liberties with Marmee 's character seem to just be a way to "" stick it "" to Alcott : "" ha ha , look how much more realistic Marmee is now !",494,0,0.00018348623853212733,0.04033409630910221,0.011077027229936608,0.00018348623853212733,0.00018348623853212733,0.00018348623853212733,0.00018348623853212733,0.08386046769287686,0.00018348623853212733,0.00018348623853212733,0.00018348623853212733,0.00018348623853212733,0.0667462326475032,0.00018348623853212733,0.02770630699393866,0.00018348623853212733,0.00018348623853212733,0.00018348623853212733,0.00018348623853212733,0.00018348623853212733,0.00018348623853212733,0.11965977347872013,0.00018348623853212733,0.00018348623853212733,0.00018348623853212733,0.00018348623853212733,0.00018348623853212733,0.00018348623853212733,0.00018348623853212733,0.011639983321902483,0.00018348623853212733,0.020263806321499125,0.00018348623853212733,0.00018348623853212733,0.08709244528830418,0.00018348623853212733,0.35864591888398634,0.015585542313325257,0.013532877250652975,0.00018348623853212733,0.00018348623853212733,0.00018348623853212733,0.00018348623853212733,0.00018348623853212733,0.06841058125732355,0.031207449214074,0.03781547344823016,0.00018348623853212733,0.00018348623853212733,0.00018348623853212733,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0

50117,1,"The book is not complete and at times can be misleading Being a student of photojournalizm in Moscow , Russia , I looked for the most complete book on photographic composition that is available . I had studied one book on the subject by the russian author , but knowing that photography in the US is much more developed and professional I was striving to get a book by a professional photographer . I was disappointed by the book "" Photographic Composition "" by Tom Grill for a number of reasons:1 . It does not cover all important compositional elements , and those that it covers are not explained in full detail . It does not explain:- how elements with the similar shapes , similar sizes or similar tone interact with each other , - the reverse perspective effect and its uses,- why right and left sides of the photograph differ and why , how it can be used on practice,- how to balance "" weight "" of different elements of the photograph , it touches it briefly and furthermore provides an incorrect example,- difference between compositional center and the center of interest , how to balance them if they are in different parts of the photo ( does not match each other)- all signs of perspective , it does not say anywhere that overlapping of objects is a clear sign of perspective ( trivial as it may sound , it still should be marked in any complete work , especially when the author covers other three elements)- and much much more.2 . It does not use photographs of the best masters to illustrate the topic , neither does it show how composition works in art , which I believe is very important.3 . Most examples are in color , while most ideas on composition are best explained using B W photographs.4 . Last but not least , composition is about meaning , making a message , not just how to balance different elements within a frame . The book makes this statement , but in my opinion fails to provide poverful examples , while you can fully appreciate the power of composition only by studying powerful photos with good explanation why precisely this photo is good . OVERALL : I believe that if you want to study composition you want to know all important considerations , not just a few and briefly explained "" how - to - quickly - improve - any - photo - you - take "" . This books fails to provide complete approach to composition and at times can be misleading . I'd be very grateful if you could recommend me ( and other folks that look at our reviews ) a more thorough book on composition , I 'm sure there must be a good book in english on that subject . Thanks!P.S. For those who can read in russian I advise a book by A. Lapin "" Fotografiya kak ..

50120,1,"Perfect cure for insomnia A friend going through the same problems as I am was strongly recommended this book by her therapist and she bought it for me , as well . I was enthusiastic to read it and at least understand these emotions . If I could actually use the information to help myself , all the better . I was warned that the beginning was a bit slow and hard to get through , so I struggled through it , expecting it to get easier to read . It did n't . It 's been sitting by my bed for months with the bookmark at page 104 and I 'm really sorry because I 'm sure that the contents are useful and interesting , but I just ca n't get past that page 104 . I normally refuse to leave a book half unread , but this just has to be an exception because every time I pick it up I fall asleep within 3 or 4 pages . I agree with some of the previous reviewers that there is way too much emphasis on the actual workings of the meetings . I feel like I 'm watching a video of it , as every minimal thing is described in incredible detail . But I wanted to read this book to understand the views and conclusions of the group , not to become an expert on the tea breaks they had . Also , I felt lost as the scientific tests they had previously carried out were explained in such detail , I ended up having to skim over some sections . This may be a great resource for those who have great patience and/or a scientific background , but too much for a regular Joe like me",300,0,0.0003703703703704051,0.03448364514917099,0.0003703703703704051,0.0003703703703704051,0.08430906813915466,0.0003703703703704051,0.0003703703703704051,0.0003703703703704051,0.0003703703703704051,0.0003703703703704051,0.0003703703703704051,0.018893135815228473,0.20293236075447,0.0003703703703704051,0.01888836655193242,0.0003703703703704051,0.0003703703703704051,0.0003703703703704051,0.0003703703703704051,0.0003703703703704051,0.0003703703703704051,0.0003703703703704051,0.0003703703703704051,0.0003703703703704051,0.0003703703703704051,0.0003703703703704051,0.0003703703703704051,0.0003703703703704051,0.0003703703703704051,0.0003703703703704051,0.0003703703703704051,0.0003703703703704051,0.0003703703703704051,0.0003703703703704051,0.0003703703703704051,0.0003703703703704051,0.3822724690488179,0.0003703703703704051,0.0003703703703704051,0.0003703703703704051,0.036112789291069945,0.0003703703703704051,0.08384744393594654,0.0003703703703704051,0.0003703703703704051,0.0953657088954837,0.028080197603908924,0.0003703703703704051,0.0003703703703704051,0.0003703703703704051,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0
50133,1,"just so - so Of the 7 or so Grisham novels I ve read this one is my least favorite . It 's not a bad story at all but it 's just way too long , about 150 pages longer than it needed to be . It also just lacked credibility in many spots . Grisham is normally quite good at presenting characters and situations that are at least plausible , if not really interesting . Most of his books give the layman some insight into the workings of the law that I ve always thought were fascinating . This book , however , plods along and does nt bring anything new to his body of work . The other thing that really got me was the dialogue he wrote for Mark Sway , the 11year old protagonist . He sounds more like a street - wise 30year old , using words like "" wonderful "" and phrases that have been out of use since the 70 's . I think Grisham forgot he was writing the words for a young boy and not one of his more typically older characters . This is nt a bad book if you just want to escape for a few hours a day but most of his other ones are far more enjoyable",221,0,0.0003636363636363953,0.0003636363636363953,0.0003636363636363953,0.03254294591332818,0.0003636363636363953,0.03757664471888364,0.0003636363636363953,0.0003636363636363953,0.0003636363636363953,0.0003636363636363953,0.0003636363636363953,0.018545454545454334,0.29997054020708147,0.0003636363636363953,0.0003636363636363953,0.0003636363636363953,0.0003636363636363953,0.0003636363636363953,0.0003636363636363953,0.0003636363636363953,0.0003636363636363953,0.12591911959475113,0.0003636363636363953,0.0757956926964321,0.06448853805147108,0.0003636363636363953,0.0003636363636363953,0.0003636363636363953,0.0003636363636363953,0.0003636363636363953,0.0003636363636363953,0.0003636363636363953,0.0680611908997793,0.0003636363636363953,0.0003636363636363953,0.0003636363636363953,0.2250755160685631,0.0003636363636363953,0.0003636363636363953,0.0003636363636363953,0.0003636363636363953,0.0003636363636363953,0.0003636363636363953,0.0003636363636363953,0.0003636363636363953,0.0003636363636363953,0.03747890275879982,0.0003636363636363953,0.0003636363636363953,0.0003636363636363953,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

For example , in one chapter Law manipulates his "" teaching "" by having God contradict the Bible ( the assumption being God 's the author ) in a dialogue with a conservative religious person . Law even sarcastically concludes the chapter by saying this dialogue is only a dream , the real God would probably respond differently . Good idea for a book , ruined by the authors distorted logic . There are numerous ad hominen and circular reasoning errors . The title and premise fooled me into reading it . Mr . Law , how will you pay back the readers for wasting the time they invested in your philosphical rant against religion",146,0,0.18458241878118356,0.0007142857142857978,0.0007142857142857978,0.0007142857142857978,0.0007142857142857978,0.0007142857142857978,0.0007142857142857978,0.3174758649875001,0.0007142857142857978,0.0007142857142857978,0.0007142857142857978,0.0007142857142857978,0.0007142857142857978,0.0007142857142857978,0.0007142857142857978,0.0007142857142857978,0.0007142857142857978,0.0007142857142857978,0.0007142857142857978,0.0007142857142857978,0.0007142857142857978,0.10963279673200264,0.0007142857142857978,0.0007142857142857978,0.0007142857142857978,0.0007142857142857978,0.0007142857142857978,0.0007142857142857978,0.0007142857142857978,0.0007142857142857978,0.0007142857142857978,0.03974814707070597,0.0007142857142857978,0.0007142857142857978,0.0007142857142857978,0.0007142857142857978,0.31641791528574686,0.0007142857142857978,0.0007142857142857978,0.0007142857142857978,0.0007142857142857978,0.0007142857142857978,0.0007142857142857978,0.0007142857142857978,0.0007142857142857978,0.0007142857142857978,0.0007142857142857978,0.0007142857142857978,0.0007142857142857978,0.0007142857142857978,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
50148,1,"K - Man 's Book Reviews A very disappointing book , and again , makes me very wary of any item on a "" New York Times Best Seller List "" or any other list , and really any big name reviewer recommendation . This book has one 50 page chapter which is excellent - the recap of the Thompson "" Shot heard around the world "" homerun . If you are a baseball fan as I am , that ( barely ) made the book worthwhile . The other 700 pages are disjoint , incomprehensible , and really trivial . You come away thinking "" I really do n't care bout this stuff "" - I do n't care about the dynamics of trash , about J Edgar Hoover 's bathroom habits , Klara Sax 's artistic depression and annoying infatuations about roof tops , about characters that just do n't have much depth to really care about . At the end , even potentially interesting characters like Albert ( the one on the baseball quest ) become hard to bear . The whole book in fact had the feel of going to a senior citizen home . I read this book , as perhaps others did , expecting a book about the mafia or about other figures in the underworld . What I got was a book with a good first chapter , some interesting tidbits here and there about how life used to be in the 50 's ( fear of nuclear weapons , duck and cover classroom exercies ) , and a lot of knowledge about the trash business . The "" masterful "" epilogue , as other reviewers call it , really does no justice to a reader who has spent so much time toiling over Delillo 's ragtag story telling . I am ok with stream of consciousness writing , or nonchronological chapters , or even random chapters , but the methods used in thsi book served no purpose other than to further make the reading difficult . Was this book about how mundane our lives are versus the bigger things that occur around us ? Or how each of us is on an individual quest ? Or that the 50's-60's-70's-80 's were just years of fear , and the 90 's are years of greed ? I am still unsure , I still do n't think any of these themes came across well . Please - not pretending to be a sophisticate , intellectual , or professional critic - but this book is really not worth the time or effort . You can be staisfied by a number of other books , including the "" The Corrections "" by Franzen or "" The Cold Six Thousand "" by Ellroy which cover a similar period or similar themes and do not make you so frustrated or disappointed at the end . Read the first chapter , then put the book down or you will be sorely disappointed and have wasted an awful lot of time .",512,0,0.028091126044306847,0.00020833333333335717,0.00020833333333335717,0.00020833333333335717,0.00020833333333335717,0.00020833333333335717,0.00020833333333335717,0.04858084684408424,0.00020833333333335717,0.00020833333333335717,0.00020833333333335717,0.00020833333333335717,0.17624985949571825,0.00020833333333335717,0.00020833333333335717,0.00020833333333335717,0.00020833333333335717,0.00020833333333335717,0.010624999999999607,0.00020833333333335717,0.00020833333333335717,0.00020833333333335717,0.00020833333333335717,0.014015317173927847,0.00020833333333335717,0.00020833333333335717,0.00020833333333335717,0.00020833333333335717,0.00020833333333335717,0.03343983699124773,0.00020833333333335717,0.00020833333333335717,0.00020833333333335717,0.00020833333333335717,0.034963528059078035,0.00020833333333335717,0.4981767990461905,0.00020833333333335717,0.031780037457849464,0.00020833333333335717,0.05132385131551657,0.00020833333333335717,0.00020833333333335717,0.00020833333333335717,0.06462879757207997,0.00020833333333335717,0.00020833333333335717,0.00020833333333335717,0.00020833333333335717,0.00020833333333335717,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

50175,1,"One of the worst novels I have finished this year Maybe it is me but this novel was about as exciting as watching the grass grow . It is the first mystery novel that I have read by a female author and I hope that it is not representative of the gender . But , by the reviews here , all by women , I can see that Jance writes to that crowd . Her readers seem to like being taken down the aimless boring pass of relationship drible . If you want to spend 10 pages with the main character sitting and talking about nothing in her mothers house or on her friends porch talking about their health than this book is for you . It is amazing that Jance can start great with the murder scene and then 200 pages later start uncovering her first clue , the insulin bottle . Jance gives no indication that Oak Vista or the stranded stranger are even remotely related to the story . Do not start this book it is absolutely a total waste of time . If you want a good mystery read Coben , Crais , Patterson or Michael Connely",201,0,0.0005000000000000485,0.0005000000000000485,0.0005000000000000485,0.046530678216224454,0.02130563768675264,0.0005000000000000485,0.029413972521031815,0.04645939449561617,0.0005000000000000485,0.0005000000000000485,0.0005000000000000485,0.0005000000000000485,0.0005000000000000485,0.0005000000000000485,0.0005000000000000485,0.0005000000000000485,0.0005000000000000485,0.0005000000000000485,0.0005000000000000485,0.06300926422641205,0.22486556483735748,0.0005000000000000485,0.0005000000000000485,0.0365941878483199,0.0005000000000000485,0.0005000000000000485,0.0354959475307047,0.0005000000000000485,0.0005000000000000485,0.0005000000000000485,0.0005000000000000485,0.0005000000000000485,0.0005000000000000485,0.0005000000000000485,0.0005000000000000485,0.0005000000000000485,0.42860917687039174,0.0005000000000000485,0.0005000000000000485,0.04771617576718711,0.0005000000000000485,0.0005000000000000485,0.0005000000000000485,0.0005000000000000485,0.0005000000000000485,0.0005000000000000485,0.0005000000000000485,0.0005000000000000485,0.0005000000000000485,0.0005000000000000485,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The Kite Runner gets off to such a good start , with its blend of history , observations about daily life in Kaboul , and a compelling story of two boys growing up together . The second half goes badly astray , as the novel becomes more and more manipulative and sentimental . By the end of the book , the author is willing to put his characters through all sorts of hell just so he can follow up with a teary reconciliation .

50191,1,"Series writing can be a terrible trap for a writer ... and I suspect this is what has happened to James Lee Burke . The Dave Robicheaux series has been floundering sadly for several books now - and that is tragic , considering the promise of the early books , which peaked in the hauntingly beautiful In The Electric Mist With Confederate Dead . I grew up in southern Louisiana , and Burke captures a culture that many people have no experience of . But the series is becoming repetitive and stale , culminating in this book , which is just awful . Burke 's characters , with the exception of the always funny and touching Cletus Purcell , are wearing thin and becoming less and less sympathetic . Dave Robicheaux becomes more priceless and preachy in each novel . His anti - alcohol tirades would make any Prohibition era preacher proud . Burke has fallen into a trap of using the same imagery and phrasing again and again , and it makes the reader wonder if he is n't cutting and pasting entire paragraphs repeatedly . If I read one more time in a Burke book that Leadbelly strung his twelve stringed guitar in octaves , I will be sick ( hey , Mr. Burke ? Twelve stringed guitars have always been strung that way , Leadbelly did n't invent that tuning , okay ? ) If I read the word "" phallus "" in a sex scene in one of Burke 's books one more time , I think I will just give up . The phrases are getting old - really old . The preaching about political corruption and alcohol got old many books ago . One thing to be thankful about in this abysmal wreckage of what was once a great series - Bootsie , Dave Robicheaux 's wife , is dead , though that does n't keep her out of the story . But at least the reader is spared another element that has been repeated to death - the moment in every book with Bootsie in it where she gets up in the night , angry with Dave , and goes to sleep on the couch . I 've had bets with other readers as to what page Bootsie will do this inevitable stunt ( which then opens up the opportunity for another sex scene with the "" phallus "" when they kiss and make up ) in each Burke novel where she is a character . Thankfully , also , Alafair , Dave 's adopted daughter , is far away at college , and we are spared her teenaged brattiness which became tedious in the earlier books and yet another repetition of the story of how Dave came to adopt her , which is included in every book since the introduction of the Alafair character . It 's time for Mr. Burke to let the series go . It 's a travesty of its former self . Reading this book is like visiting a relative who has lost their mind to dementia - you see a hollow , nearly unrecognizable shell of a formerly vital and beloved person . It 's painful",539,0,0.00023255813953490374,0.00023255813953490374,0.00023255813953490374,0.00023255813953490374,0.00023255813953490374,0.00023255813953490374,0.00023255813953490374,0.07042635309411774,0.00023255813953490374,0.00023255813953490374,0.00023255813953490374,0.00023255813953490374,0.03941898273665463,0.00023255813953490374,0.00023255813953490374,0.00023255813953490374,0.00023255813953490374,0.00023255813953490374,0.00023255813953490374,0.00023255813953490374,0.27845282595200915,0.00023255813953490374,0.00023255813953490374,0.10500014350045339,0.00023255813953490374,0.00023255813953490374,0.00023255813953490374,0.00023255813953490374,0.00023255813953490374,0.00023255813953490374,0.00023255813953490374,0.02404736892115287,0.06361266689183996,0.00023255813953490374,0.00023255813953490374,0.00023255813953490374,0.3697439913304865,0.00023255813953490374,0.00023255813953490374,0.00023255813953490374,0.023028988046472035,0.016733795805882648,0.00023255813953490374,0.00023255813953490374,0.00023255813953490374,0.00023255813953490374,0.00023255813953490374,0.00023255813953490374,0.00023255813953490374,0.00023255813953490374,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
50199,1,"Muddled I usually enjoy Ms. Maron 's Deborah Knott books very much . The characters are well drawn and give deep insight into Southern life . This one , however , is very flat and the characters are poorly drawn and one dimensional . The first murder does n't seem to contribut anything to the storyline and is just "" there "" . The second one involving Dwight 's son ( who is a very poorly developed child character ) and his ex wife is not very interesting . I devoutly hope this was the nadir of the series and it will improve after this . Probably not , though - I foresee several storylines involving husband / stepmother / stepchild conflicts .

50208,1,"If you like books about unicorns , read this I 'll put my opinion first , so there wo n't be any doubt in your mind . I do n't believe that you can write useful books about national character . Is there really such a thing as quot;national character quot ; ? People are just too different , too unpredictable . How well can you predict the behavior of the people closest to you ? How well can you predict what people in your own country will do ? Would every Italian , if they could write well , have written the same book as Mr. Barzini ? I seriously doubt it . So what we have in THE ITALIANS is one man 's views on the conglomerate nature of 50 million Italians . After reading it , I felt even more strongly that such books , though possibly entertaining , are a waste of time . An informative book about unicorns -- but do they exist ? Anthropologists have been concerned , for many years , in getting the quot;inside view quot;--the view of a culture as seen by the person within it . While Barzini is indisputable Italian , he tries to visualize Italians as seen by foreign visitors , then explain to those of us not lucky enough to travel there , why they are as visitors see them , or why they are not as foreigners may think . This is not a successful gambit . Cultures are based on many general factors -- like history , socio - economic patterns , religion , family , etc.---but the specific results are just that , specific . Barzini covers many topics -- the importance of spectacle and giving an illusion of something rather than actually having that quality ; the family vs. the state ; Italian modes of achieving success ; the north - south split ; Sicily and the Mafia ; and last , the tragedy of Italy 's long domination by foreigners . But nothing really connects . There are only superficial , scattered impressions , nothing very concrete to grasp . The reader is left with a handful of stereotypes . Barzini is at his best when describing the lives and modus operandi of particular characters in Italian history . These sections were well - written and interesting . But his portrayal of Italian quot;character quot ; is fuzzy , contradictory , and ultimately , unconvincing . Finally , if you are a lover of lists , you will thrill to this book , because there is a list on nearly every single page . Myself , I got pretty tired of those lists . If you want to know something useful about Italy , read another book . If you just want entertainment , which might support any stereotypes you have about Italians , then this book could be for you",489,0,0.08954162589459772,0.0002469135802469343,0.012805231055896893,0.0002469135802469343,0.0002469135802469343,0.0002469135802469343,0.0002469135802469343,0.05633621297033113,0.0002469135802469343,0.0002469135802469343,0.0002469135802469343,0.0002469135802469343,0.2302873328954486,0.0002469135802469343,0.0002469135802469343,0.0002469135802469343,0.0002469135802469343,0.0002469135802469343,0.0002469135802469343,0.0002469135802469343,0.0002469135802469343,0.0002469135802469343,0.0002469135802469343,0.0002469135802469343,0.0002469135802469343,0.0002469135802469343,0.0002469135802469343,0.0002469135802469343,0.0002469135802469343,0.0002469135802469343,0.0002469135802469343,0.036916903515073034,0.0002469135802469343,0.0002469135802469343,0.08837738992390078,0.0002469135802469343,0.3620084106316953,0.09358172667503623,0.0002469135802469343,0.0002469135802469343,0.020021709647896187,0.0002469135802469343,0.0002469135802469343,0.0002469135802469343,0.0002469135802469343,0.0002469135802469343,0.0002469135802469343,0.0002469135802469343,0.0002469135802469343,0.0002469135802469343,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I have nothing against Andrew Hurley , but his translation of Borges leaves me cold . I 'd give Borges 5 stars out of 5 , but Hurley ? No more than 2 .",138,0,0.0009523809523810034,0.2081011760856349,0.0009523809523810034,0.0009523809523810034,0.0009523809523810034,0.0009523809523810034,0.0009523809523810034,0.0009523809523810034,0.0009523809523810034,0.0009523809523810034,0.0009523809523810034,0.0009523809523810034,0.0009523809523810034,0.0009523809523810034,0.0009523809523810034,0.0009523809523810034,0.0009523809523810034,0.18081571638044966,0.0009523809523810034,0.0009523809523810034,0.0009523809523810034,0.0009523809523810034,0.048571428571428536,0.0009523809523810034,0.0009523809523810034,0.0009523809523810034,0.0716354068691998,0.0009523809523810034,0.0009523809523810034,0.0009523809523810034,0.0009523809523810034,0.0009523809523810034,0.0009523809523810034,0.0009523809523810034,0.18950884772317297,0.21184361484630168,0.0009523809523810034,0.04857142857142938,0.0009523809523810034,0.0009523809523810034,0.0009523809523810034,0.0009523809523810034,0.0009523809523810034,0.0009523809523810034,0.0009523809523810034,0.0009523809523810034,0.0009523809523810034,0.0009523809523810034,0.0009523809523810034,0.0009523809523810034,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1

50224,1,"This book is n't for everyone I bought this book this weekend as we 're doing the pre - five in a Row w / our preschooler and I do n't much like it . I 've got a mother w / borderline personality disorder and who does n't observe personal boundaries of other 's what - so - ever ( if I need a break away , she hunts down my poor husband , all my relatives and friends- ugh ) and so this book just kind of made my stomach turn as I could see her reading this to me and justifying her ' stalker mom ' mentality . In the end , I think if a person is from a semi - normal household w / proper respect for a child 's boundaries and need for space away from their parents , then this book is okay . I just find some moms are too smoothering- even ones w/o personality disorders- and this book does n't send a message about love as much as ' I own you ' . I like ' Mama Do You Love Me ? ' better for explaining to a child a parent 's unconditional love . 'Good - Night Moon ' by Margaret Wise Brown , however , is by far my children 's all time favorite book . I was reading that one to them ineutero and still every night before they go to bed . They love it and so do we as parents . But this one even creeped my hubby out and he 's from a fairly ' normal ' family .

50236,1,"Nothing New Wright presents no new information about Al - Qaeda , leaves out plenty of information about Al - Qaeda and neglects the USA side of "" the road to 9/11 . "" Understanding Qutb 's radicalization of Islam is important to understanding why Ayman al - Zawahiri and Usama exist and also why they failed at creating theocracies and were lame ducks until the USA found a use for them as an enemy . What can not be neglected is the myths spread about the United States by the Neoconservatives and followers of Leo Strauss . The United States is not a unique and beautiful snowflake . The liberal idea of individual freedom was decried by Strauss as destructive of the society of the USA and he told his followers to keep the public in line with grand myths about US exceptionalism . After the the Soviet Union was kicked out of Afghanistan , both Qutb and Strauss ' followers believed they were the cause of it . Since the Cold War the US has been working off of the "" friend and enemy "" model of policy formulated by Carl Schmitt and 9/11 presented the US with what Schmitt called a "" state of exemption . "" If you think jihad was the cause of 9/11 , ask yourself why Richard Clarke found Bush and his advisors saying find a way to tie this to Iraq hours after 9/11 . See the BBC documentary , "" The Power of Nightmares "" or "" From Secularism to Jihad : Sayyid Qutb and the Foundations of Radical Islamism "" by Adnan A. Musallam or the Political Ideas of Leo Strauss by Shadia Drury for a better analysis of Qutb and Strauss than Wright has in his book .

50251,1,"A bone to pick with ' Skeleton Man ' ! I 've read only a few of Hillerman 's previous Leaphorn / Chee novels . I 've enjoyed what I 've rtead , though they are an acquired taste , and I do n't indulge in them very often . I tend to enjoy the earlier , more active years of Joe Leaphorn more interesting than his ' semi - retired unofficial advisor to Jim Chee ' phase . From what I gather , ' Skeleton Man ' continues a recent trend of disappointment with Hillerman 's last few novels . Even without having read the books immediately prior to this one , I can understand that sentiment . 'Skeleton Man ' starts off with a rather risky premise , tying the story in with the real life collision over the Grand Canyon in 1956 . While an author can occasionally pull off a good story with a strong connection to ' real life'(See Nelson De Mille 's ' Night Fall ' ) , Hillerman fails here . The story is bogged down with bland and unlikable supporting characters , flimsy motivation , and very little that could really be called ' action' . Chee ends up joining Leaphorn in the background for much of the story . The spiritual and ritualistic aspects of Hillerman 's earlier books are , for the most part , glossed over here . Even what should have been a major plot development ( Chee 's wedding ) is overshadowed by Chee have to rescue Manuelito , in the manner of far too many contrived ' Superman rescues Lois ' situations . Better to stick with Hillerman 's earlier novels . The ' aging athlete past his prime ' analogy suits Hillerman , I 'm afraid",301,0,0.000487804878048809,0.000487804878048809,0.027862276343677748,0.000487804878048809,0.000487804878048809,0.000487804878048809,0.000487804878048809,0.24453675453058632,0.000487804878048809,0.000487804878048809,0.000487804878048809,0.000487804878048809,0.000487804878048809,0.000487804878048809,0.000487804878048809,0.000487804878048809,0.000487804878048809,0.000487804878048809,0.000487804878048809,0.000487804878048809,0.000487804878048809,0.10299375547931588,0.000487804878048809,0.000487804878048809,0.000487804878048809,0.000487804878048809,0.000487804878048809,0.000487804878048809,0.000487804878048809,0.000487804878048809,0.000487804878048809,0.000487804878048809,0.029582530853724618,0.000487804878048809,0.1857736474001514,0.000487804878048809,0.20863052831818413,0.000487804878048809,0.000487804878048809,0.000487804878048809,0.13192487594798308,0.000487804878048809,0.000487804878048809,0.000487804878048809,0.04820782624832679,0.000487804878048809,0.000487804878048809,0.000487804878048809,0.000487804878048809,0.000487804878048809,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

50268,1,"Great company and leader - Outdated and dubious book I wavered awhile between three stars and two stars , because a company and entrepreneur as brilliant as Sony and Akio Morita seem to deserve at least three . However , in the end , the book 's errors just piled too high . It opens well , with the story of Sony 's founding and rise from leaking offices in a half - wrecked department store just after World War II , to becoming one of the world 's great companies . This is a fascinating and inspiring story , and Morita tells it with flair . Then , unfortunately , the downward spiral begins . Morita consistently takes his experience at Sony and assumes that every other Japanese company operates the same way , which is a fantastically wrong assertion ( as the last thirteen years of Japan 's seemingly endless recession have shown ) . He also frequently takes good basic management techniques , like trusting employees and giving them creative leeway , and tries to brand them as somehow uniquely "" Japanese"" . Then there are all the claims which are simply out - and - out false , such as Japan supposedly having the world 's best construction technology . ( It actually has perhaps the worst in the industrial world , as the Kobe earthquake unfortunately demonstrated . ) Or how Japan is supposedly a nation fanatically devoted to not wasting anything . ( Yet it only recently discovered the concept of "" second - hand goods "" , instead of throwing nearly - new furniture and clothing away . Plus , Japanese garbage trucks groan under the weight of the world 's worst overpackaging.)Reading between the lines , a person can see the roots of so many of the problems that Japan faces today . For example , Morita spends a good deal of words attacking the excess of lawyers in the United States . While this can , of course , sometimes be a serious problem , it also gives U.S. consumers a way to protect themselves . Japan 's consumers , on the other hand , without an accessible court system , are almost completely at the mercy of bureaucrats and executives . Complaints about dangerous products or chemicals in drinking water are simply ignored , because they lack any threat of legal action . In another example , Morita praises the "" trust "" and agreements without contracts that exist among Japanese corporations . In reality , this "" trust "" is a death pact , as bankrupt inefficient companies are propped up by their buddies , instead of letting them fall and create openings for fresh and innovative entrepreneurs . Other than the glimpses into Sony 's history and corporate culture , this book is only interesting as a museum piece - yet another in the flood of "" Japan is going to take over "" books that came out in the Eighties . Although , of course , considering all the "" Internet companies are going to take over "" books that came out in the Nineties , not even this is a uniquely "" Japanese "" phenomenon . PS : Anyone wanting a healthy reality check about the current state of Japan should read "" Dogs and Demons "" by Alex Kerr .",565,0,0.0002409638554217135,0.0002409638554217135,0.0002409638554217135,0.028806026820257225,0.03518235533564821,0.0002409638554217135,0.0002409638554217135,0.18907196114491046,0.0002409638554217135,0.0002409638554217135,0.0002409638554217135,0.0002409638554217135,0.0002409638554217135,0.0002409638554217135,0.02425465642753591,0.0002409638554217135,0.08788369304336544,0.019152568122817275,0.0002409638554217135,0.0002409638554217135,0.0002409638554217135,0.0002409638554217135,0.02560460634258568,0.0002409638554217135,0.0002409638554217135,0.0002409638554217135,0.052515823692255416,0.0002409638554217135,0.01283862457254665,0.0002409638554217135,0.0002409638554217135,0.024994412326966406,0.15602438481583242,0.0002409638554217135,0.0002409638554217135,0.0002409638554217135,0.22466729106262176,0.0002409638554217135,0.0002409638554217135,0.0002409638554217135,0.013833099579208244,0.0002409638554217135,0.023262552176216096,0.0002409638554217135,0.0002409638554217135,0.07347420959747294,0.0002409638554217135,0.0002409638554217135,0.0002409638554217135,0.0002409638554217135,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
50272,1,"A book that will make you laugh and frighten you Mr. Galbraith is smart , accomplished , and learned man who knows what is best for all us . His view of a good society differs from past visions of societal utopia . Rather than a completely coercive state directing the actions of its citizens to some hirer calling , Mr. Galbraith aims to be ` practical ' and just further defines the third way . Nonetheless , his proposal of what makes a good society is not the classical liberal view and it is more attuned to the European model of society . Many of his proposals are so silly you wo n't take them seriously . But sadly , he is quite serious . For example , Mr. Galbraith states that in a good society everyone should have a rewarding life . Of course , he never defines the standard by which society should judge whether or not a life is rewarding . Neither does he address what one should do if their life is un - rewarding and what the obligation is of society to fulfill that vision of a rewarding life . And , of course , who is the ` rewarding life judge ' and does this judge have the authority of the state to take something from someone ( who has a life that is deemed too rewarding ) for someone who has life that is too un - rewarding . Mr. Galbraith fails to convince the reader of the practicality of his proposals and ends up straddling a line between socialism and capitalism , and saying nothing new",275,0,0.0005263157894737242,0.05213662997296416,0.0005263157894737242,0.03633576175449942,0.0005263157894737242,0.0005263157894737242,0.0005263157894737242,0.48113571430383867,0.0005263157894737242,0.0005263157894737242,0.0005263157894737242,0.0005263157894737242,0.0005263157894737242,0.0005263157894737242,0.0005263157894737242,0.0005263157894737242,0.09842200352578648,0.0005263157894737242,0.0005263157894737242,0.0005263157894737242,0.0005263157894737242,0.0005263157894737242,0.0005263157894737242,0.0005263157894737242,0.0005263157894737242,0.0005263157894737242,0.0005263157894737242,0.0005263157894737242,0.0005263157894737242,0.0005263157894737242,0.0005263157894737242,0.13153863696879017,0.07892446210226979,0.0005263157894737242,0.0005263157894737242,0.0005263157894737242,0.09887521242448088,0.0005263157894737242,0.0005263157894737242,0.0005263157894737242,0.0005263157894737242,0.0005263157894737242,0.0005263157894737242,0.0005263157894737242,0.0005263157894737242,0.0005263157894737242,0.0005263157894737242,0.0005263157894737242,0.0005263157894737242,0.0005263157894737242,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
50279,1,"Not one of Quindlen 's best This book was easy enough to read , it just was n't what I expected from Quindlen . I usually find her writing style and her way of thinking about things so captivating , in this book I really did not find either of those traits to stand out . The back - and - forth from current day to the past was somewhat confusing , and sometimes I was in the middle of a paragraph before I realized this paragraph was a jump to the past , whereas the previous paragraph was present time . Although I got used to that writing style , I always found it annoying . The storyline itself never sold me either : a typical , young "" sew - your - wild - oats "" boy finds a baby and decides to keep it and is the "" perfect "" father . I just did not find such an occurrence likely . And , as a mother myself , all the times he either left the newborn alone or took it with him while he labored on the land just made me squirm .

50296,1,"Too popular to bother trying anymore . J.K. Rowling successfully put me off this book series within the first two chapters of this book . The characters personalities were wavering in book 5 , in this they completely vanished or mutated . I 'll only be getting the 7th one because it 's the last one and I 've read this far so I might as well go the whole way . In books one through four the trio of Harry , Ron , and Hermione were loveable characters tenaciously and cleverly seeking out the answers to the mysteries that came up each year and saving the day . Book 5 had them doing more angsting and screaming than mystery solving , and more whining than day saving . Book 6 made them stand in paper doll doing a bad job miming the motions the real characters would have done . This book Harry seemed to care more about romance . A very poorly done romance littered with cheezy phrases and romantic moments on par with the worst of bad fanfiction ; which had no background or build up from previous books . A female character from the background , whom Harry barely even notices all through the past five books , is suddenly the most perfect and beautiful girl in the school in mary - sue fashion . Several other characters in both the foreground and background were also unfortunately treated to Rowlings amature attempts at romance , none of which bore any revelance to plot or story . Harry also had a significant decline in morality and intelligence . The clever boy who put clues together with his friends now cheats in one of his classes and makes one stupid mistake after another . The image of Harry that stuck with me and seemed to glare off the pages every time he spoke or did anything was of him lying , frozen in a curled position on the floor of the train with blood coming out of his broken nose , under his invisibility cloak and rolling around with the trains motion after a particularly stupid episode with Malfoy . As to the general plot of the book . Poorly done . Continually backstaged by sickeningly done romance and angst it barely made an impression on me . Most of the ' revealations ' in the book revealed nothing not already known or obvious from old information , and the culmination of what Harry was not - quite - solving did n't amount to anything . My final opinion : Do n't bother to read past book 4 if you 're just starting the series and care anything at all about characterization .

50303,1,"There is no number , only a lot of assumptions and risks "" The number "" poses an interesting question but provides no helpful answers . A four percent draw on invested assets is as much an old wives ' tale as a piece of scientific wisdom , even if it is a number . Eisenberg 's number is the inverse of that draw down , or twenty - five times .... well , there 's the rub , twenty - five times what ? income ? expenses ? income less savings ? projected discretionary spending ? Post - mortgage payoff and college tuition expenses ? The proverbial bottom line is clouded by conversations with an eclectic collection of consultants , experts , philosophers , and casual acquaintances . Eisenberg , a former Esquire editor and short - timer with Lands End , ruminates about a simple question : How much money do you need to feel secure ? The problem is that security comes in multiple forms : happiness , comfort , excess consumption , ego . And the accuracy and stability of those measures and outcomes is compounded by key assumptions about how long you will live and how healthy those years will be . Constructing a one - year budget is hard enough . Constructing a thirty - year budget is nearly impossible . Eisenberg does n't help his case by the offbeat and idiosyncratic examples and profiles he chooses . Doctors , divorcees , ` downshifters ' , and very little real data shed little light on the real issues . Maybe I knew too much going in . Maybe I expected too much from a few positive references from other sources . In the middle I was confused . By the end I was simply disappointed .

50309,1,"Holy Moly This is the book Dan Brown 's bestseller "" The Da Vinci Code "" is based on . Indeed , Michael Baigent et.al . have even sued Brown in court , charging him with plagiarizing their book . The ideas behind "" The Da Vinci Code "" have been exposed as completely bogus by many real historians . Obviously , this exposure affects "" Holy Blood , Holy Grail "" as well . This book is methodologically flawed . It claims that Jesus survived the crucifixion and sired children with Mary Magdalene . But if this happened , there should be ancient documents telling us about it . There are essentialy only three ancient views of Jesus : the Christian , the Judeo - Christian and the Gnostic . None of them includes the notion that Jesus married and had children with Mary Magdalene . It simply is n't serious to reject the ancient documents in favor of modern texts of questionable value , as Michael Baigent does . Of course , a conspiracy theorist might claim that the ancient documentation is lacking due to a massive cover - up . But such an argument , compelling as it may sound , is worthless to the historian , who must work with the real evidence , meager as it may be . A claim that can neither be proven or disproven is of little help . Besides , how many sects or cults have managed to keep their esoteric secrets ? Very few indeed . There is always a defector or infiltrator somewhere . The idea that the biggest secret of all times was revealed by a confused French right - wing extremist only 40 years ago is very hard to take seriously . Indeed , the fact that not even heretical groups like the Gnostiscs claimed that Jesus had sired children , is good evidence against the claim . The Gnostics , after all , made all kinds of peculiar statements . But not this one . Why ? Why are books like "" Holy Blood , Holy Grail "" and "" The Da Vinci Code "" so popular ? Perhaps they say what many people want to hear . That in itself is somewhat damning , I think . For how many people want to hear the truth ?",393,0,0.21149829839636752,0.0004878048780488119,0.0004878048780488119,0.0004878048780488119,0.0004878048780488119,0.0004878048780488119,0.0004878048780488119,0.08481933226188637,0.0004878048780488119,0.0004878048780488119,0.0004878048780488119,0.0004878048780488119,0.0004878048780488119,0.0004878048780488119,0.0004878048780488119,0.0004878048780488119,0.119220000864276,0.0004878048780488119,0.0004878048780488119,0.0004878048780488119,0.0004878048780488119,0.0004878048780488119,0.0004878048780488119,0.0004878048780488119,0.0004878048780488119,0.0004878048780488119,0.0004878048780488119,0.0004878048780488119,0.025264773505217417,0.0004878048780488119,0.0004878048780488119,0.0004878048780488119,0.0004878048780488119,0.0004878048780488119,0.19856051672431865,0.0004878048780488119,0.26646135380571095,0.0004878048780488119,0.0004878048780488119,0.0004878048780488119,0.07320011468612408,0.0004878048780488119,0.0004878048780488119,0.0004878048780488119,0.0004878048780488119,0.0004878048780488119,0.0004878048780488119,0.0004878048780488119,0.0004878048780488119,0.0004878048780488119,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

50314,1,"Sociology , more of the same This is a revolutionary book . It introduces the stage metaphor into sociology ; all of social interaction is a performance on a stage . It 's questionable how novel this metaphor is , but this is certianly its first explicit statement . The language used to present the ideas of the author is , like most sociological writing , unecessarily complicated . There are some problems with clarity and structure ; the book just does nt have a holistic feel for me . No sociological background is presupposed , there is extensive quoting from other sociological sources , many footnotes , and various other ways to enter sociological literature throught the book . So if you are interested in reading sociology , this is probably a good place to start ( again , the language is unecessicarily thick and this may be it 's bane as an introduction).However , the book is misguided . The idea of viewing social interaction as a performance on a stage is unecessary . The authors motives for saying this will make my position clearer.(The following is a charicature of the author 's argument ) . There is certianly a large amount of social behavior which is directed towards other people ( the audience ) in order for the audience to build an impression of the actor . Well , if it can happen here we can draw a parallel with other situations , infact all situations and therfore all of social interaction is like a performance on a stage , "" All the world is not , of course , a stage , but the crucial ways in which it is nt are hard to specify "" ( p 72 ) . The performances can either be with individuals , or groups of people , and they can be performing conciously or unconciously . ( end of charicature)There are other arguments , obviously , and the statement "" we can draw a parallel with other situations "" is most of the content of the book , which i do nt like to gloss over with a sentence . But the real question here is , is the view worthwhile ? My answer : No . Social interaction is a complex phenomena that ca nt possibly be summed up with a signle metaphor . Yes , some social interaction is like a performance , where indivudals are intentionally making impressions on one another . Yes , some social behavior can arise from unconcious beliefs . However , most social interaction is exactly the way we see it , conciously controlled , meaningful , purposeful interaction with individuals ; it is not some kind of performance with the purpose of creating a "" reality"" . I hope my view of the book is clear so that the biases on the final part of my review can be sorted out : the book is a waste of time . Where the author is right , the statement is little more than common sense . Where the author goes outside of common sense , he 's wrong , sometimes plainly so . This book is part of the tradition in sociology of thinking that society pulls the wool over each individuals eyes , that reality is a social construct with no purpose other than social control ( here the wool is the performance , and the control has to do with impressions ... but this quickly degenerates into an obscure mess of assertions ) . There is no real empirical support given for most of the claims . Where "" evidence "" is given , the evididence is so heavily intepreted that it fails to correspond to facts in the world but rather to facts about the views of the reporter . Where there is no correspondence to the world there is no truth . Various sources of sociology are cited , but this is more like intellectual bullying . Saying that some author , which also did nt have any empirical support for his claims , agrees with you is just to bully your reader into acepting your claims . The claims in the book have no practical application in the world , but only serve to intepret situations differently , and in personal opinion , less correctly . Nothing said here will lead to better predictions about social behavior or a better understanding of psychology . In short , this is nt a scientific study at all . My final qualm with the book deserves its own paragraph , the use of language . The best example is the definitions given at the end of the introduction "" A performance may be defined as all of the activity of a given participant on a given occasion which serves to influence in any way any of the other participants "" ( 15 ) . This is a curios definition . Me breathing while i work is a performance , it changes the percentages of O2 and CO2 in the atmosphere near my co - workers . Me staring into space is a performance , other people see me stare into space and are therefore influenced . Infact , me simply existing is a performance , since my existance causes a gravitational effect on the other participants , as well as influencing them to create beliefs about me existing . Its as if Goffman created a definition for performance which included all possible actions taken by any person , and then wrote a book about how all possible actions taken by any person fall under the category of performance . He did nt . He used a word that we associate with controlled behavior ( performance ) and defined it in a way no one is used to . Then he used alot of word play to show that behavior has no substance , its all for the purpose of maintaining social reality . I hope this very limited example shows the terrible use of language that is endemic to Goffman and sociology more generally . So an ode to sociology is in order ... actually no it is nt . Why wo nt this subject go away ? This book is an integral part of sociology , and it espouses the methods and style of sociological researchers and writers by being an archetypical work within the tradition . The methods are questionable ; the style is obscure . Like it or hate it , sociology is a part of modern thought . Read the book to be an educated person and keep in mind its intellectual failings",1117,0,0.2535192714367878,0.00012121212121213434,0.08179176171289493,0.00012121212121213434,0.014191656030649166,0.09053710742480073,0.00012121212121213434,0.19597600999552134,0.00012121212121213434,0.00012121212121213434,0.00012121212121213434,0.00012121212121213434,0.00012121212121213434,0.00012121212121213434,0.00012121212121213434,0.00012121212121213434,0.00012121212121213434,0.00012121212121213434,0.00012121212121213434,0.00012121212121213434,0.00012121212121213434,0.00012121212121213434,0.00012121212121213434,0.00012121212121213434,0.00012121212121213434,0.00012121212121213434,0.00012121212121213434,0.00012121212121213434,0.00012121212121213434,0.00012121212121213434,0.00012121212121213434,0.00012121212121213434,0.00012121212121213434,0.00012121212121213434,0.00012121212121213434,0.00012121212121213434,0.24368320692382678,0.030665027579139994,0.00012121212121213434,0.00012121212121213434,0.00012121212121213434,0.00012121212121213434,0.00012121212121213434,0.02885149116481692,0.010880167103563147,0.00012121212121213434,0.045055815779513585,0.00012121212121213434,0.00012121212121213434,0.00012121212121213434,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0

50317,1,"False advertizing . I would love to read a neutral book on Barry Bonds , I hate cheerleader type books about players but I also hate one - sided ones as well . The only good things he really has to say about Bonds are about his baseball brain and his relationship with the famous Marge ( whom he then sarcastically remarks that Bonds was only her second favorite player).The book covers a wide variety of topics , some are puzzeling . While most of the book bashes Barry Bonds is also bashes his ex - wife for being an exotic dancer . I was pretty upset to read that , I was a fan of Pearlman but I thought he had more class then that . This book came out right after ( or because of ) Game of Shadows . This book here actually praises Game of Shadows while bashing Bonds for illegal activities when 3 weeks after the book came out the writers of Book of Shadows are being subpeoned for illegally optaining information , guess that backfired Pearlman . In fact Game of Shadows may be taken off the shelves soon as well . The book uses many annoymous sources ( there is a reference sheet in the back , most of those articles all include quotes from many unidentified sources ) , so its really hard to take alot of the harsh quotes that Bonds says seriously because it is heresay . The book pretty much discredits itself at the end when Pearlman proclaims that sports writers do not actually try or want to dig up dirt on people , they like to find good stories . That quote alone will have any Bonds hater rolling thier eyes at the sheer stupidity of it . Sports writing has became essectially a tabliod now . Even Skip Bayless publically admitted that most writers do that . So once again , the biggest problem is that it fails to stay on neutral ground . This would be like writing a book about Babe Ruth and only mentioning that he beat up umpires , ran into the stands to attack people , slept with hookers , drank all the time , was mean to Lou Gherig , etc . While that may be true it would also only tell one part of the story and would be a waste , just like this",405,0,0.18435409787359894,0.027870580614885225,0.00029411764705885023,0.00029411764705885023,0.00029411764705885023,0.00029411764705885023,0.00029411764705885023,0.00029411764705885023,0.00029411764705885023,0.00029411764705885023,0.00029411764705885023,0.00029411764705885023,0.00029411764705885023,0.00029411764705885023,0.00029411764705885023,0.00029411764705885023,0.00029411764705885023,0.00029411764705885023,0.00029411764705885023,0.00029411764705885023,0.00029411764705885023,0.12397463855406635,0.00029411764705885023,0.02998793884590901,0.00029411764705885023,0.019513462809205122,0.00029411764705885023,0.00029411764705885023,0.00029411764705885023,0.021315882915673275,0.00029411764705885023,0.00029411764705885023,0.00029411764705885023,0.00029411764705885023,0.00029411764705885023,0.00029411764705885023,0.4339105963944439,0.00029411764705885023,0.00029411764705885023,0.04342217679250617,0.00029411764705885023,0.00029411764705885023,0.015630429193951044,0.00029411764705885023,0.00029411764705885023,0.00029411764705885023,0.08825549012340703,0.00029411764705885023,0.00029411764705885023,0.00029411764705885023,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

In a world no longer dominated by a few French terms we are led to believe that this book will bridge the gap between old - school cooking books ( say , from before 1990 ) and the current state of culinaria . Why then are so many of the terms defined in an out - dated , even archaic mind - set?Take the term "" brown sugar "" . This book says it is "" unrefined or partially refined sugar "" , a definition all well and good perhaps 200 years ago . Today brown sugar is almost always made from refined sugar with a special molasses syrup and colorings added back to it - a very different thing indeed , and Grimes should know the difference . The are innumerable other examples available in the same vein . Additionally , Grimes give us "" food lists "" scattered periodically throughout the book but provides only sporadic support for the words used in them . For example , there is a list of Varieties of Apples . 48 varieties are listed but when one wants more information on them it is often lacking . Sure "" Red Delicious "" apples have an insipid definition in the "" R "" section but what about the more interesting varieties like "" Sundowner "" , or "" Lodi "" apples ? No further mention of them can be found in the book . There is also a huge list of "" Fish and Seafood "" but if you are intrigued by what the "" Geoduck "" or "" Sprat "" listed might be , you 're out of luck ( without running to a REAL culinary dictionary).The bright ( if limited ) spots in the book are the articles on food etymology and history . There are 7 of them ( reprints from other publications and various authors ) that are each informative and interesting . Grimes would have done much better to have put together a collection of these little insightful gems and left the definitions to those more inspired by the subject . My guess is that the brevity of the definitions ( leading to rampant deficiencies ) was , perhaps , an attempt at simplicity but the effective "" dumbing - down "" of the book is insulting to anything but the most elementary reader . I know that Grimes , a former restaurant reviewer for the New York Times , must know a lot more about food than this book makes him sound . Grimes is listed as the "" editor "" of this work ( along with a number of others ) and it defies logic why he would allow his name used as the primary . Unfortunately , my copy of this book is destined for "" re - gifting "" or a permanent place on a dusty shelf somewhere while my venerable , dog - eared Larousse Gastronomic retains it 's place of honor near my desk . Bon appetite , ex libris , and caveat emptor .

50330,1,"A Different Definition of a Classic Mark Twain once said that ( and I paraphrase)the definition of a classic is something that everyone wants to have read and no one wants to read . That is my experience with this book . For some reason , A Tale of Two Cities never made it onto any of my high school reading lists , and I figured it was one of those books I should have under my belt . So I picked it up . What a slog ! A book that might have been fascinating due to its French Revolution subject matter was a mass of rambling descriptions and melodrama . We were supposed to shed tears for Sidney Carton , a character who you barely get to know , and root for Lucie Manette ... the highly unrealistic paragon of unspoiled goodness . The only thing I liked about this book was how Madame Defarge knitted a list of people on which she planned to take revenge . An admittedly cool concept . Maybe this book speaks to another era , maybe it 's past its prime , maybe I do n't have the required literary sensibilities , or maybe I could n't relate , but A Tale of Two Cities bored me to tears .",218,0,0.0006060606060606508,0.0006060606060606508,0.0006060606060606508,0.0006060606060606508,0.0006060606060606508,0.0006060606060606508,0.03090909090909089,0.0006060606060606508,0.0006060606060606508,0.0006060606060606508,0.0006060606060606508,0.030909090909090844,0.20128441061258848,0.0006060606060606508,0.0006060606060606508,0.0006060606060606508,0.0006060606060606508,0.0006060606060606508,0.0006060606060606508,0.0006060606060606508,0.0006060606060606508,0.03731924375393869,0.0006060606060606508,0.0006060606060606508,0.0006060606060606508,0.06943960286890347,0.09759830257481947,0.0006060606060606508,0.0006060606060606508,0.0006060606060606508,0.0006060606060606508,0.0006060606060606508,0.0006060606060606508,0.0006060606060606508,0.0006060606060606508,0.0006060606060606508,0.35940202868681853,0.0006060606060606508,0.0006060606060606508,0.0006060606060606508,0.0006060606060606508,0.0006060606060606508,0.0006060606060606508,0.0006060606060606508,0.0006060606060606508,0.14768368423020217,0.0006060606060606508,0.0006060606060606508,0.0006060606060606508,0.0006060606060606508,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
50335,1,"Great concepts that go nowhere . I zipped through the first 100 pages of this book unable to put it down . Unfortuneately the author seems to run out of gas after that . The main character just goes on a big , boring sight seeing tour . It reminded me of that show on the Travel Channel where that girl visits hotel after hotel fawning over the interior design . There is not a hint of conflict until the final pages and then it 's very short - lived and quickly followed by one of the worst non endings I 've ever read . The book just stops . Not a hint of resolution or even a cliff hanger pointing to a sequel . It 's a shame because Grimsley had some great concepts to work with . In my experience novels that mix technology with magic usually fail at both , but Grimsley had a workable foundation he could have developed into something unique if he had focused on the SF concepts instead of minutiae . Once in a while the characters stop admiring the drapes long enough to notice the GIANT FREAKIN ' PORTAL BETWEEN TWO WORLDS -- but enough about that .

50336,1,"What Crash ? This book contains some useful historical information and some insights into the mass psychology of booms , bubbles , and busts . Prechter should have left it at that . Instead , he offers up predictions . Big mistake . This guy bases his forecasts on Fibonacci numbers and so - called Elliott "" wave counts . "" He labels all market patterns so that they fit the preordained Elliott Wave 5-up , 3-down pattern . If you see more or fewer waves than he does in any given market move , you just do n't understand that there can only be 5 waves to the top of a bull market . He 's imposing his theory on the market , but surprisingly enough , the market does n't care . It does whatever it wants , in however many waves it wants , and Bob has been very frustrated at the market 's aberrant behavior lately . He got lucky early in his career , but it seems he 's been fairly consistently getting the market wrong since missing the ' 87 crash . Any superstitution can "" seem "" to work if you only look at its happenstance apparent accuracies and disregard its abundant failures . Keep looking for certain numbers of waves and Fibonacci ratios and you 'll find what you 're looking for . Pick any set of numbers or patterns or wave counts , and you 'll find those too . The market does n't care about any of those things , though . It 's nothing more than an aggregation of billlions of individual choices , which are influenced by an infinite number of factors none of us can ever understand fully . University studies of various investing methods have found that Elliott Wave , like most , is no better than random stock selection . If Prechter had chosen the random method , he and his followers would at least have a good chance of keeping pace with the market . Unfortunately , he has been getting everything from the Dow , to oil ( he thought it was going to $ 10 ) , to gold ( he did n't think it could break $ 400 ) , to deflation ( the "" deflation "" scare ended shortly after this book came out ) WRONG in the past couple of years . He apparently STILL believes that the Dow will go to 400 ( not 4,000 but FOUR HUNDRED ) because his charts tell him it should ( they 've been telling him that since about 1990 , actually ) . Prechter does n't understand demographics or economics or markets or the monetary system , all of which render "" Dow 400 "" among the goofiest of forecasting absurdities -- unless you believe a giant asteroid will hit and wipe out two thirds of the population ( I do n't think Prechter is counting on that).Our debt - heavy economy may have a significant crisis soon , perhaps by the end of the decade . It will most likely be spurred on by inflation and rising interest rates . But it 's not happening now and it 's not happening in the way this author has been prematurely forecasting for over a decade . This book came out near the bottom of the 2000 - 2002 stock bear market , just in time for a reader to short stocks as they began a new bull market . How typical . While promoting the book , Prechter said it was "" definite "" that stocks would "" crash""in 2003 . He said that 2003 would be "" the best year yet "" for bears ( short sellers ) . Late into 2003 , when it was clear that the market had proven him wrong , Prechter declared on a radio show that by the end of 2004 , the Dow would "" certainly "" fall below 5,000 . Wrong again ! Since his Fibonacci turn dates and Elliott wave counts fail to portend the future , maybe next he 'll tell us he 's found the secret code to the stock market from the text count of Nostradamus ' writings . Bob Prechter could n't call the market if it was listed in the Yellow Pages . This guy could n't time the market if you gave him a stopwatch . He 's throwing out guesses and misleading people by describing them as "" definite "" and "" certain . "" He 's either a liar or a true believer in his own irrational superstitions . In either case , he 's not credible . Here 's all you really need to know : Buy dividend stocks . Buy short - term bonds . Buy gold . Hang on to them . Do that and you 'll do better than you will trying to follow the prognostications of market gurus . Plus , you 'll have a lot more time to devote to family , fun , and productive activities",850,0,0.000185185185185202,0.000185185185185202,0.000185185185185202,0.011988574429328928,0.000185185185185202,0.000185185185185202,0.000185185185185202,0.000185185185185202,0.000185185185185202,0.000185185185185202,0.000185185185185202,0.000185185185185202,0.22418440418043656,0.000185185185185202,0.000185185185185202,0.000185185185185202,0.07326000189477672,0.052739962293818284,0.000185185185185202,0.000185185185185202,0.000185185185185202,0.000185185185185202,0.000185185185185202,0.014829475578357528,0.000185185185185202,0.007884641215280479,0.000185185185185202,0.000185185185185202,0.000185185185185202,0.000185185185185202,0.000185185185185202,0.000185185185185202,0.05061093143340447,0.000185185185185202,0.000185185185185202,0.000185185185185202,0.16744050641187794,0.000185185185185202,0.000185185185185202,0.000185185185185202,0.000185185185185202,0.000185185185185202,0.000185185185185202,0.000185185185185202,0.18512422426786068,0.2045298708874505,0.000185185185185202,0.000185185185185202,0.000185185185185202,0.000185185185185202,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0

50383,1,"Pamuk 's First Novel is a Disappointment Like many others in my book group , I had been looking forward to finally reading something by Pamuk . And like most of my book group , I was fairly disappointed by this short early novel from him . Originally published in Turkey in 1985 , the story is prefaced by an introduction in which one Faruk Darvinoglu purports to have discovered the manuscript in a dusty archive . He then goes on to explain that parts of the story can be historically corroborated , but much of it ca n't . This should immediately alert the reader not to take everything in the book as it comes . Even more so if the reader knows that Darvinoglu is the protagonist of Pamuk 's earlier book The House of Silence . Such intertextual tricks immediately bring to mind the works of Calvino , Borges , and their ilk . The basic plot is very straightforward : in the mid 17th - century , a young Venetian gentleman is captured by Turkish raiders and sold into slavery to an aspiring Turkish scholar who happens to look just like him . The two men then spend the next few decades cloistered together , engaged in various psuedo - intellectual investigations of astronomy , biology , engineering , and so on . These bring them to the attention of the Sultan ( based on Mehmet IV ) , whose patronage waxes and wanes , culminating in a lengthy attempt to construct a powerful war machine . Along the way , their claustrophobic relationship swings back and forth , and is interrupted by an outbreak of the plague , whose outcome they are tasked with predicting . The book concludes with a brief section which will challenge the reader 's assumptions and calls into question everything that comes before it . Namely , are there two characters or are they just manifestations of two aspects of a single person?This all unfolds at a glacial pace , and the two "" characters "" are mere ciphers . Their clashing of wills and ideas take up page after page , but the reader is always told about the conflict rather than shown it , and this makes for disengaging reading . Pamuk seems much less interested in storytelling or characters than in grand themes such as the nature of identity , the collision of cultures , and the very nature of reality . But none of these are addressed in a way that is particularly fresh or interesting . The tension between East and West is handled in a fairly superficial manner , as the Turkish master is obsessed with Western advances in science and technology , while the Sultan has a credulous appetite for tall tales and soothsayers . This all comes across as a rather ambivalent satire of the fluidity of Turkish national character . In the end , this is not a particularly good introduction to major modern writer whom many have compared to Eco , Calvino , Borges , Kafka , and Kundera . However , readers who enjoy highly ambiguous works about self - identity with unreliable narrators may find this a satisfying read",541,0,0.15990411265060847,0.0002985074626865919,0.018213339505892,0.0002985074626865919,0.021756402139118124,0.0002985074626865919,0.0002985074626865919,0.08418153902134495,0.0002985074626865919,0.0002985074626865919,0.0002985074626865919,0.015551687145522694,0.0002985074626865919,0.0002985074626865919,0.0002985074626865919,0.0002985074626865919,0.0002985074626865919,0.0002985074626865919,0.0002985074626865919,0.02085363629096056,0.0002985074626865919,0.0002985074626865919,0.0002985074626865919,0.0002985074626865919,0.0002985074626865919,0.0002985074626865919,0.0002985074626865919,0.0002985074626865919,0.0002985074626865919,0.04883569148147684,0.0002985074626865919,0.015417005198078907,0.0002985074626865919,0.0002985074626865919,0.033928658361781557,0.0002985074626865919,0.5452468072633326,0.0002985074626865919,0.0002985074626865919,0.0002985074626865919,0.0002985074626865919,0.0002985074626865919,0.0002985074626865919,0.0002985074626865919,0.0002985074626865919,0.02446932989710639,0.0002985074626865919,0.0002985074626865919,0.0002985074626865919,0.0002985074626865919,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
50389,1,"Incredibily unpleasant read I have been a huge fan of the Anna Pigeon mysteries . The hard truth about Hard Truth is skip it . It is a very unpleasant experience . The graphic representation of child abuse and cruelty in this book still makes me ill . What I 've loved about the Anna Pigeon series is that I felt like I got a good sense of the national park where the story took place with an appreciation for the natural beauty of the area . I doubt Anna spent more than a night in Rocky Mountain National Park . Not only does she completely miss the unique character of the park but the park has no necessary link to the story . The whole thing could have taken place in urban Chicago . I have been picking up Nevada Barr books as fast as I could find them . This book , however , was truely repulsive .

50392,1,"Pseudo - feminist tripe I fail to understand all of the hoopla about Susan Sontag . While I have only read a limited selection of her work , in these essays , quot;Against Interpretation quot ; being the ultimate example , Sontag emerges as a simple - minded , arrogant ignoramus . In her utterly unreasoned invective , Sontag ignores ( or is just unable to understand ) two critical facts . First , some works of art and theory are difficult to understand ( in varying degrees ) without the help of interpretation . Sontag 's flawed analysis of the supposed ruination of the works of Kafka by interpretation demonstrates that not only is she among this crowd , she has clearly reached new and unheard of misguided heights . Second , Sontag ignores the fact that works of art in other languages can not be understood in translation without the help of interpretation and criticism that demonstrates the extent to which aspects of a certain culture are imbedded in the original language . This could n't possibly be clearer than in poetry . Weinberger 's excellent quot;Nineteen Ways of Looking at Wang Wei quot ; , which adroitly considers the subject , had n't been released when Sontag published this essay but it probably would n't have made a difference . What was she thinking ? The only good aspect of the essay ( and why I give it 2 stars instead of 1 or zero ) is the fact that it has given me ample opportunity to win arguments against individuals who are flawed in their thinking enough to enjoy Sontag 's writing",276,0,0.0005000000000000538,0.0005000000000000538,0.0005000000000000538,0.03282795699192625,0.0005000000000000538,0.0005000000000000538,0.0005000000000000538,0.0005000000000000538,0.0005000000000000538,0.0005000000000000538,0.0005000000000000538,0.0005000000000000538,0.0005000000000000538,0.0005000000000000538,0.0005000000000000538,0.0005000000000000538,0.0005000000000000538,0.0005000000000000538,0.0005000000000000538,0.0005000000000000538,0.0005000000000000538,0.0005000000000000538,0.0005000000000000538,0.0005000000000000538,0.0005000000000000538,0.0005000000000000538,0.0005000000000000538,0.0005000000000000538,0.0005000000000000538,0.10279248520324026,0.0005000000000000538,0.0005000000000000538,0.0005000000000000538,0.0005000000000000538,0.0005000000000000538,0.0005000000000000538,0.4331979365419844,0.12550000000145145,0.16010651570604822,0.0005000000000000538,0.08861592759527125,0.0005000000000000538,0.0005000000000000538,0.0005000000000000538,0.03545917796007573,0.0005000000000000538,0.0005000000000000538,0.0005000000000000538,0.0005000000000000538,0.0005000000000000538,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0
50402,1,"Awkward writing makes a bad story even worse . Middle - aged Gracie is a typical Hollywood wife , right down to her botox injections and designer wardrobe . When her husband dumps her after almost ten years of marriage , Gracie finds herself without love , without friends , and most importantly , without status . ( But at least she 's still got the money!)Actually , most of what I know is from the dust jacket since this book was too torturous to finish . The plot is predictable and uninteresting and is littered with so much name - dropping that sometimes it 's hard to follow . The characters are taken straight from Stereotype 101 and are so badly written that they 're impossible to relate to . The writing is ponderous and lumbers along awkwardly , lacking polish , wit , or interest . Especially irritating is Grazer 's insistence on using Gracie 's name as much as possible . For example:""Gracie thought about it ; they 'd never been to marriage counseling . Gracie had gone to counseling in the beginning of their marriage - there were many issues to overcome .

The prologue of this book lead me to believe this was going to be a very touching love story of a woman losing the love of her life and finding love again . I was disappointed , soon after , when it turned into a gardening manual and a tale about ghosts , with a sort of haphazard romance thrown in the middle - and then even that was disappointing . I mean Graceland for a first date ? I noticed a lot of similarities between Roz and the mayor in Northern Lights , and Logan and Nate from that same book . None of them can talk in complete sentences .

There is no addressing the issue of moving on with her life after the death of her husband , she just does it .

50423,1,"poetry in Riis ' How he oher half Lives How the Other Half Lives was written over a century ago as an expose ' of the appalling living conditions in the tenements of New York City . The author speaks with a crusader 's zeal and with so much detail that the reader can visualize these tenements , these streets , and these people as if they were living today . This is a grim and moving portrayal of the lives of the men , the women and the children that inhabit these loathsome neighborhoods of New York City in the late 1800s . He so graphically describes the filth , the sunless and airless rooms , the crowding , and the starvation that these places palpably exist for the reader and bring a chill to any heart . Riis has a genuine concern for the tenement situation and understands these people 's plight . His pictures are touching and meant to vividly show their misery . He , for the most part , blames the money - hungry landlords for these crowded conditions : "" How shall the love of God be understood by those who have been nurtured in sight only of the greed of man . "" ( p. 266 ) . He laments that the tenement is three quarters responsible for the misery of the poor . Then , after his extensive discourse , he offers three concrete cures for these dreadful conditions , something that many authors forget when they are enlightening readers . Riis states his purpose for writing this book himself on page 297 when he says , "" If this book shall have borne ever so feeble a hand in garnering a harvest of justice , it has served its purpose . "" The author apparently succeeded with his purpose , because in the flyleaf of this book the publisher tells us : "" This book helped bring about new revisions in the housing codes of the major U. S. cities . ""How does this book relate to adult education ? By moving chronologically from the founding of America to the slums of NYC in the 1800s , are we to understand that education took a back seat to the accumulation of money during those hundred years ? Certainly Riis posits that education is one of the solutions to this problem while at the same time implying that wealth accumulation and the lack of education has been the cause of this problem . "" Thus the whole matter resolves itself once more into a question of education , all the more urgent because these people are poor , miserably poor almost to a man . "" ( p. 147 ) . He does not forget that this "" education "" is not only for the poor people , but also for the wealthy landlords . "" Clearly , it is a matter of education on the part of the landlord no less than the tenant . "" ( p. 270 ) . Riis ' almost missionary language exhorts us to never allow greed to override a compassion for humanity . "" It is a fight in which eternal vigilance is truly the price of liberty and the preservation of society . "" ( p. 233 ) . The relation of this book to the other units of study in this course could be explained as an example of how low mankind can descend if education is not considered one of the major cornerstones of a society . Although this book was exhaustive in its detail , it was easy to read while at the same time enlightening . I found myself enjoying the ranting tone and the fascinating lists of neighborhoods and the labels that Riis used for the different races . In a sense it reads like a Ginsberg poem ; constantly hitting the reader with melodious lists of places and people from another era .

The list goes on . To someone reared in rural America , this chant sounds like a song about another country . Riis also has something to say about all the races of people that live in the tenements of New York City : Chinaman ( he ca n't be taught ) , ( Chinese ( coolie -- laundry business ) , Polish Jew ( coops himself up in his den with his thermometer at boiling ) , Russian Jew , Jew ( money is their God ) , Bohemian ( poor , but thrifty ) , Blacks ( like to gamble , but they are clean ) , Greek , Hebrews ( tailors , all of them ) , Dutchman , Irish ( like to drink and have expensive funerals ) , German ( order loving ) , Swiss , Pasquales , Russian , Italian ( a born gambler ; lighthearted and gay ) , Swamp Angel ( thieves ) , Street Arabs ( army of homeless boys ) , Tramps and Toughs ( the world owes them a living),and the Celtics . I was enthralled by the street lingo and the colloquialisms and Riis ' comments about every race . I noticed one interesting similarity between the late 1800s and the present day . Riis says that the gap between the social classes is widening everyday . I hear people talking about the growing differences between the rich and the poor often these days . Does every generation think that is happening in their time ? Not only should this book be used by people researching New York City`s tenements , but it should also be read by everyone seeking a blueprint for social change . It is a reminder to show us how hopeless the human circumstances can become when man 's greed overrides his concern for human dignity .",1080,0,0.00017094017094018512,0.09588738580053924,0.08453709927548207,0.00017094017094018512,0.00017094017094018512,0.00017094017094018512,0.00017094017094018512,0.2843584288731621,0.00017094017094018512,0.00017094017094018512,0.00017094017094018512,0.00017094017094018512,0.00017094017094018512,0.00017094017094018512,0.017264957264329785,0.00017094017094018512,0.00017094017094018512,0.00017094017094018512,0.00017094017094018512,0.013795648495668446,0.00017094017094018512,0.00017094017094018512,0.028477428588673828,0.009806230526174563,0.00017094017094018512,0.00017094017094018512,0.00017094017094018512,0.00017094017094018512,0.00017094017094018512,0.00017094017094018512,0.00017094017094018512,0.00017094017094018512,0.008562393633535626,0.00017094017094018512,0.045296518261461895,0.00017094017094018512,0.25729885852822565,0.009643119451164263,0.02991330314736029,0.050598739884244875,0.05840604211613079,0.00017094017094018512,0.00017094017094018512,0.00017094017094018512,0.00017094017094018512,0.00017094017094018512,0.00017094017094018512,0.00017094017094018512,0.00017094017094018512,0.00017094017094018512,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

50436,1,"Dressed Up Postmodern Metafiction The first book of Auster 's New York trilogy was originally published in 1985 , and in 1994 was adapted into this graphic novel . I 've never read the original ( or any of the other parts of the trilogy ) , so I ca n't comment on Karasik and Mazzicchelli 's adaptation . However , I can say that since I 'm not particularly fond of existentialist or postmodernist literature ( those two terms being the most common critical shorthand for Auster 's story ) , this really did n't do anything for me at all . The story is basically an exercise in metafiction , and if you like that stuff , great -- I do not . It is dressed up ( at least initially ) in the mystery genre , but that 's just window dressing . ( There 's a long legacy , especially in France , of cloaking novels and films of ideas in genre trappings ( for example Alain Robbe - Grillet 's two books The Erasers and The Voyeur , or the films of Jean - Pierre Melville.)The story begins fairly straightforwardly : a reclusive writer of potboiler mysteries named Daniel Quinn lives in New York on his own since the death of his wife and son . A complete stranger calls him and thinks Quinn is a private detective named Paul Auster and begs him to to take his case . ( The writer Paul Auster , and his family , shows up for one scene -- it 's that kind of book . ) Quinn meets with the strange man , who was raised in rather harrowing circumstances by his professor father , who was seeking to discover the true language of God . The father has been released from jail and Quinn is supposed to keep an eye on him and report . Everything starts to derail when he loses track of both the old man he 's been following , and his clients . He spends several months watching the building and going crazy . Once he realizes they 've disappeared , he finds his own life has disappeared as well . Obviously this is all somewhat about identity , but it 's more about fun stuff like language , representation , and other tiresome postmodern subjects ( as are the other two parts of the trilogy , which involve a man spying on someone , and yet another disappearance ) . It has to be said that the artwork does an admirable job of treating the bizarro world Auster has thrust his characters into . The simple , heavy black and white inking is a perfect match to the material , especially when the representations become less literal and more symbolic . However , if your taste runs more toward things like plots and characters , this is probably not for you . Fans of Auster may enjoy this , but fans of the graphic novel form are probably going to be much less keen .",514,0,0.00024390243902441296,0.03794937262640356,0.00024390243902441296,0.00024390243902441296,0.00024390243902441296,0.00024390243902441296,0.00024390243902441296,0.14446564963789058,0.00024390243902441296,0.00024390243902441296,0.00024390243902441296,0.00024390243902441296,0.10124112097184951,0.00024390243902441296,0.00024390243902441296,0.00024390243902441296,0.00024390243902441296,0.00024390243902441296,0.00024390243902441296,0.00024390243902441296,0.00024390243902441296,0.00024390243902441296,0.00024390243902441296,0.04970477649134061,0.00024390243902441296,0.00024390243902441296,0.00024390243902441296,0.00024390243902441296,0.00024390243902441296,0.00024390243902441296,0.00024390243902441296,0.00024390243902441296,0.00024390243902441296,0.00024390243902441296,0.13979839849463166,0.050103400592897446,0.15046861736516415,0.027500021411042817,0.00024390243902441296,0.00024390243902441296,0.00024390243902441296,0.03785173034808235,0.016482865128313266,0.13490744926456585,0.1002583049848906,0.00024390243902441296,0.00024390243902441296,0.00024390243902441296,0.00024390243902441296,0.00024390243902441296,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0
50439,1,"Posing for high school seniors I bought this book to try to learn some useful poses for my subjects , and given most other people 's ratings , I decided to give it a try . However , upon opening the book my first thought was , "" these all look like high school yearbook photos "" , which is exacltly what they are . It seems that that 's primarily what type of photography the author does and his book is geared almost exclusively to that market . His main concern , which he stresses throughout the book , is creating a "" saleable picture "" , and he keeps emphasizing the importance of pleasing mom , since she 's usually the one with final say over the pictures . A better title for this book would have been , "" How To Take High School Senior Pictures"" . Even then , most of the pictures are not very good , both in their original execution and in their print quality for this book . In addition , the poses are unnatural and awkward looking , and the book is filled with typos and grammatical errors . To be fair , the author does suggest some useful basics of things to do and things not to do when posing a subject , but there is really very little useful information here . So , if you 're interested in learning how to take pictures that look like a Sears portrait , this may be the book for you . However , if you really want to learn some useful techniques for posing your subjects in a more natural or more artistic manner , I 'd steer clear of this book",291,0,0.17237439741133717,0.0003773584905660648,0.03725215583769448,0.049098147015639394,0.0003773584905660648,0.0003773584905660648,0.0003773584905660648,0.0003773584905660648,0.0003773584905660648,0.0003773584905660648,0.0003773584905660648,0.0003773584905660648,0.0003773584905660648,0.0003773584905660648,0.0003773584905660648,0.0003773584905660648,0.0003773584905660648,0.0003773584905660648,0.0003773584905660648,0.0003773584905660648,0.0003773584905660648,0.0003773584905660648,0.0003773584905660648,0.0003773584905660648,0.0003773584905660648,0.13537622844907218,0.0003773584905660648,0.0003773584905660648,0.0003773584905660648,0.04074554569107833,0.0003773584905660648,0.0003773584905660648,0.0003773584905660648,0.0003773584905660648,0.0003773584905660648,0.0003773584905660648,0.48964103964037164,0.0003773584905660648,0.059286070860465986,0.0003773584905660648,0.0003773584905660648,0.0003773584905660648,0.0003773584905660648,0.0003773584905660648,0.0003773584905660648,0.0003773584905660648,0.0003773584905660648,0.0003773584905660648,0.0003773584905660648,0.0003773584905660648,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
50451,1,"Generalized overview with little new insight I agree completely with the Becksted review ( I also noted that it was helpful , but I meant it would have been helpful had I read it before I bought the CD).This refers to the CD version . I did listen all the way to the end , I kept thinking there was going to be something , but continued to be disappointed . I found the analogizes to be strained beyond usefulness ( evaluating someone 's integrity by the size and shape of the wake they create ... are their people waterskiing on it ? ) It seems to be politically incorrect to come out in opposition to "" integrity "" in this day and age , but frankly this book did n't help me much .",135,0,0.0008333333333333884,0.17371022496171218,0.0008333333333333884,0.0682681895938624,0.0008333333333333884,0.0008333333333333884,0.0008333333333333884,0.0008333333333333884,0.04250000000000871,0.0008333333333333884,0.0008333333333333884,0.0008333333333333884,0.182778893910535,0.0008333333333333884,0.0008333333333333884,0.0008333333333333884,0.0008333333333333884,0.0008333333333333884,0.0008333333333333884,0.0008333333333333884,0.0008333333333333884,0.0008333333333333884,0.0008333333333333884,0.0008333333333333884,0.0008333333333333884,0.0008333333333333884,0.0008333333333333884,0.0008333333333333884,0.0008333333333333884,0.0008333333333333884,0.0008333333333333884,0.0008333333333333884,0.11032173421769176,0.0008333333333333884,0.09611639798255499,0.0008333333333333884,0.17931396316732062,0.0008333333333333884,0.0008333333333333884,0.0008333333333333884,0.0008333333333333884,0.0008333333333333884,0.0008333333333333884,0.0008333333333333884,0.11199059616631214,0.0008333333333333884,0.0008333333333333884,0.0008333333333333884,0.0008333333333333884,0.0008333333333333884,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

50465,1,"Steinbeck 's Bait - and - Switch : A Good Writer Fails to Act I 'm perhaps the only Steinbeck lover not to have yet read "" Grapes of Wrath "" or "" East of Eden . "" Instead I have focused on "" Of Mice and Men "" and his lesser known works , such as "" To a God Unknown "" and , my personal favorite , "" Pastures of Heaven . "" I 've been enamored with his ability to vividly craft characters in particular . When I began reading "" In Dubious Battle , "" it appeared the most engaging of all Steinbeck 's work . Telling the story of American Communist party workers Jim and Mac , it begins with the story of hardscrabble Jim initiating himself into Mac 's radical cell . There is a great ( and misleading ) sense of intrigue - Mac and Jim travel by boxcar , work secretly through letters , go from secret contact to contact and finally arrive among disgruntled orchard workers . Early on , the pace is fast , exciting , and engaging . Suddenly , Steinbeck simply fails to deliver , leaving the reader wondering when he 's going to pick up the pace again . After Jim and Mac slowly initiate a worker 's strike , I expected the sense of excitement to continue . It simply never does . Summary of "" In Dubious Battle "" - Workers get mad . Workers get tired . Workers get mad . Workers get tired . Workers get mad . Workers get tired . The rest of the book mostly concerns Jim and Mac talking - and talking - and talking - and talking . And while their philosophical chats are mildly interesting at first , they simply repeat themselves for the rest of the book . Most of the action takes place in the dark or far away from the narration , and most of the story simply concerns the strikers bickering over petty nonsense ...... and eating . Steinbeck must have been peckish while writing this story , because at least a good 25 % of the story concerns finding , eating , and ( worst of all ) TALKING about food . There is plenty of action that Steinbeck could have shown during the story , but for some reason he prefers to focus on Jim and Mac endlessly walking from tent to tent in their encampment , discussing whatever comes to mind . Steinbeck 's sense of intrigue and social injustice is worth reading the first few chapters . But I advise any reader of "" In Dubious Battle "" to take this course - after the strike is initiated , simply set the book down . You wo n't miss anything . Nothing of great import happens , and only a very few memorable characters ever surface , and they are lost among the sea of forgettable faces . I suppose now I 'll give "" Grapes of Wrath "" a go . Perhaps if it is n't one of his "" greats , "" it is n't worth reading",530,0,0.046464173151353226,0.00028169014084509695,0.00028169014084509695,0.00028169014084509695,0.00028169014084509695,0.00028169014084509695,0.00028169014084509695,0.04153971892532504,0.00028169014084509695,0.00028169014084509695,0.00028169014084509695,0.00028169014084509695,0.00028169014084509695,0.00028169014084509695,0.00028169014084509695,0.00028169014084509695,0.00028169014084509695,0.00028169014084509695,0.00028169014084509695,0.00028169014084509695,0.00028169014084509695,0.00028169014084509695,0.00028169014084509695,0.00028169014084509695,0.00028169014084509695,0.015498479607702722,0.00028169014084509695,0.00028169014084509695,0.00028169014084509695,0.02755446067830987,0.00028169014084509695,0.016481204895460882,0.3114445604657605,0.00028169014084509695,0.1590015754072935,0.00028169014084509695,0.3166906006303819,0.00028169014084509695,0.00028169014084509695,0.00028169014084509695,0.00028169014084509695,0.00028169014084509695,0.014466965993421416,0.00028169014084509695,0.03959065461118715,0.00028169014084509695,0.00028169014084509695,0.00028169014084509695,0.00028169014084509695,0.00028169014084509695,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0
50467,1,"Better guides available When I traveled in Japan with a friend , this was the book we brought with us . Within a week we were at a foriegn language bookstore in Tokyo looking for a better one . There are some things this guide does quite well -- it helped us out finding reasonably priced places to stay throughout the country , and the advice to get a JR pass was invaluable . However , the book has a very negative , immature view of Japan as a country and travel in general . It seems to be written by bitter expatriates with a fascination with gaijin bars and the sex trade . Did I pay $ 1200 for plane tickets to go drink with Americans ? The authors express a bias against culturally interesting sites , ancient and modern , that borders on the anti - intellectual . The cultural notes are dated , inaccurate , and shallow . After a while , we began to think , "" If Lonely Planet does n't recommend it , it 's probably interesting . "" The maps , as many have mentioned , are almost useless . Ironically for a series which fetishizes getting off the beaten path , it 's practically useless once you get out of the main tourist areas . There are much better guides available .

50469,1,"Sluggish , Uneventful , Corny and Borrrrring I usually read Stephen King for his interesting ideas and imagery and expect his books to read fast and well . I 've read three previous King books that have had the occasional long passages with overstated depictions of horror , doom , and grotesquery in order to immerse his readers into the tone of his story . This one takes the cake because what is meant to read as terror and horror is really ridiculous and unimaginative . And this is exactly what "" Insomnia "" is . This is n't a spoiler , just the author 's note : at the end of the book we read Sep. 10 , 1990- Nov 10 , 1993- three years in which King took to write this book . Three years which were evidently wasted . The other King books I 've read were engrossing for their characterizations and character identification . "" Insomnia 's "" Ralph Roberts is certainly a character the reader could identify with . He is strong , kind , has traditional gentlemanly views on aiding women in distress and regards them as beautiful and respectable . His counterpart Lois Chasse does n't come across as identifiable . Instead she serves as a secondary character who has no real flair or identity other than being in love with Ralph . King does n't usually do that with his secondary characters . Other characters with much smaller roles in this book come across as real and identifiable , like Ed and Helen Deepenau , the three bald doctors , and Ralph 's numerous confidantes . Then there 's the whole abortion mess . This central political issue crumbles midway thru and seems to serve no purpose at all in the story . Though King does provide an interesting and seemingly objective commentary on the issue via Detective Leydecker ( albeit with a tranparently pro - choice slant ) , it serves no relevance to the theme of the story but just hangs there on display used for no more than a story device . I gave the book two stars because I am an inspiring writer and reading this provided me with some of the devices that are important to utilize as part of a writer 's arsenal . The devices were obvious and all thru the reading I asked myself , ' How is King going to get through this ? ' His weapon of choice was most often Ralph Robert 's narration ( via third person ) that analyzed the events of the story and interpreted its meaning and significance . It seemed whenever King was in trouble in the story , he would use Ralph as his solution and let him think it out and guide it for him . This is a useful tool for a beginning writer , but King used it as a crutch to tell a story that had no pulse from the beginning . One last thing , the villians just do n't work . They are not frightening , they are not demonic , they are not vicious or malign . Three little bald doctors with scalpels and scissors ? Their defining characteristics are being small and bald- does that really frighten anyone ? The real villian among them dances around and jump ropes to reveal his evil madness . Then there 's the Crimson King , the evil supernatural mastermind we read about from page 100 who finally enters the story on page 550 as a Catfish in one of the most terrible , anti - climactic scenes ever rendered . I rest my case .",615,0,0.00018867924528304087,0.00018867924528304087,0.00018867924528304087,0.02256180645501128,0.00018867924528304087,0.007457659787966659,0.00018867924528304087,0.05459199834125233,0.00018867924528304087,0.00018867924528304087,0.00018867924528304087,0.00018867924528304087,0.12463679189739496,0.00018867924528304087,0.00018867924528304087,0.00018867924528304087,0.00018867924528304087,0.00018867924528304087,0.00018867924528304087,0.00018867924528304087,0.00018867924528304087,0.00018867924528304087,0.00018867924528304087,0.00018867924528304087,0.011012792266802676,0.00018867924528304087,0.00018867924528304087,0.00018867924528304087,0.00018867924528304087,0.00018867924528304087,0.00018867924528304087,0.00018867924528304087,0.00018867924528304087,0.00018867924528304087,0.12582198916881596,0.00018867924528304087,0.43356892915207645,0.00018867924528304087,0.00018867924528304087,0.00018867924528304087,0.052991175220524336,0.00018867924528304087,0.009629719381571523,0.07377916648939274,0.00018867924528304087,0.03481350539009112,0.04196465512834452,0.00018867924528304087,0.00018867924528304087,0.00018867924528304087,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0

50499,1,"The Rest of the Story This is a very famous and a very influential book . This was not the first time I checked the book out of the library but I now know much more about antidepressants and the related issues than I did when I first became familiar with Kramer 's book . What I found on my quick survey of the book this time amazed me . This is not a book supported by research . It is a book of stories . The stories , one after the other , are about Kramer 's patients ( Kramer is a psychiatrist ) and how taking Prozac dramatically transformed lives overnight . Consider these four examples.1 . Sam : "" Sam not only recovered from his depression , he declared himself better than well . He felt unencumbered , more vitally alive , less pessimistic . Now he could complete projects in one draft , whereas before he sketched and sketched again . His memory was more reliable , his concentration keener . His memory was more reliable , his concentration keener . Every aspect of his work went more smoothly . He appeared more poised , more thoughtful , less distracted . He was able to speak at professional gatherings without notes.(Page x.)2 . Sally : After four months on Prozac , she looked brighter , calmer , self - assured , in control of herself . The most important effect of the medication , Sally felt was that it cleared her head ... After ten months ... she negotiated a small promotion and pay raise at a time when the bank was cutting back staff ... More remarkable was the change to her private life . She started going to dances ... (Page 147.)3 . William M : The patient 's low self - esteem , which had been present since his earliest childhood , began to disappear ... On medication William M. experienced a sense of self - worth superior to any he had felt before . ( Page 203.)4 . Ms. B : For the first time in her memory she felt perfectly relaxed and happy sitting at home reading books or listening to music and felt less of the free - floating anxiety that was previously quelled by going out ... Off Prozac , Ms. B. bar - hopped in search of men . Prozac moderated her sense of aloneness and allowed her to enjoy a variety of social settings . Dozens of other examples could be cited . The point is , this is essentially the book . It is a book which convinces the reader of the almost magic power of Prozac by sharing stories like these . What is disturbing is that I now know the truth . Research investigations have found that the power of antidepressants has increased dramatically . They are now more effective because our belief in the power of a pill to cure social shyness , anxiety , depression , and a bad temper has increased dramatically . We have come to believe , as Kramer puts it , "" biology is destiny "" ( page xiv ) . No where does Kramer explain that the longest of the clinical trial used to get approval of Prozac to market was only 8 weeks long . No where does he share that a tranquilizer was given to study subjects and the other tricks used to make the effectiveness of the drug appear greater than it really is . The dangers of long - term use ( diabetes , Parkinson 's disease , permanent muscle jerking , etc . ) are never discussed . ( Of course , these problems were still unknown when Kramer wrote . ) See Timothy Scott 's wonderful , and unlike Kramer 's book , carefully documented book America Fooled : The Truth About Antidepressants , Antipsychotics , and How We 've Been Fooled to find the dangers as well as what does bring good mental health . Yes , this book has been influential . Thus , Kramer bears some of the responsibilty for the myth surrounding antidepressants . ( They do not work as well as exercise even -- numerous studies . ) It 's funny how , as our knowledge grows , a great book beomes a harmful book , but it is just that .",736,0,0.00019607843137256766,0.00019607843137256766,0.00019607843137256766,0.00019607843137256766,0.00019607843137256766,0.00019607843137256766,0.00019607843137256766,0.16492790878894353,0.00019607843137256766,0.00019607843137256766,0.00019607843137256766,0.01005625792751567,0.15095362092363426,0.00019607843137256766,0.00019607843137256766,0.00019607843137256766,0.00019607843137256766,0.00019607843137256766,0.00019607843137256766,0.00019607843137256766,0.00019607843137256766,0.00019607843137256766,0.00019607843137256766,0.00019607843137256766,0.035529184818439724,0.00019607843137256766,0.00019607843137256766,0.00019607843137256766,0.038893837949169834,0.00019607843137256766,0.00019607843137256766,0.00019607843137256766,0.00019607843137256766,0.00019607843137256766,0.07557145486224726,0.00019607843137256766,0.37822191211578843,0.00019607843137256766,0.00019607843137256766,0.00019607843137256766,0.00019607843137256766,0.030289275006592908,0.034830173248134325,0.00019607843137256766,0.04777980268232472,0.00019607843137256766,0.02529951285367923,0.00019607843137256766,0.00019607843137256766,0.00019607843137256766,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0
50501,1,"Weak Link in a Great Series I read A is for Alphabet years ago and did not get pulled into the series . Years later I read S is for Silence and was hooked . I started to read the series -- backwards at first and then jumped to the beginning . I have really enjoyed the books and felt a connection to the heroine ( and forgiven Ms. Grafton for making her weigh 118 lbs on her 5'6 "" frame ) . However , I agree with the other readers who feel like this is not Grafton at her best . You just ca n't believe that Kinsey would put herself in these ridiculous positions --- belting a police officer to endear herself to a woman she is investigating , remaining in an incredibly ( and unbelievable ) dangerous situation , to name a few . The dialogue is weak , the sexual situations seem gratutitous , and there is a fair amount of stereotyping of hispanics . But even with these issues , I did finish the book . Grafton at her low point is still a good read",191,0,0.0005555555555556087,0.0005555555555556087,0.0005555555555556087,0.0005555555555556087,0.03231994533939833,0.0005555555555556087,0.0005555555555556087,0.0005555555555556087,0.0005555555555556087,0.0005555555555556087,0.0005555555555556087,0.0005555555555556087,0.0005555555555556087,0.0005555555555556087,0.0005555555555556087,0.0005555555555556087,0.0005555555555556087,0.0005555555555556087,0.0005555555555556087,0.0005555555555556087,0.0005555555555556087,0.10121465327183587,0.02887344639687789,0.1048640819772398,0.0005555555555556087,0.0005555555555556087,0.036943584972905646,0.0005555555555556087,0.0005555555555556087,0.0005555555555556087,0.0005555555555556087,0.0005555555555556087,0.05504665205580681,0.0005555555555556087,0.0005555555555556087,0.02849407013031815,0.3787526661605564,0.0005555555555556087,0.0005555555555556087,0.0005555555555556087,0.2107131219172809,0.0005555555555556087,0.0005555555555556087,0.0005555555555556087,0.0005555555555556087,0.0005555555555556087,0.0005555555555556087,0.0005555555555556087,0.0005555555555556087,0.0005555555555556087,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

First of all , we are living in the end times , and when Jesus comes , that 's all she wrote , folks . There 's no seven years , no Christians being zapped up , etc . This is our Second Chance on Earth . No tribulation . This book takes figurative visions and tries to apply it literally , and does it poorly . Reading this book made me think that if this was true , then what 's the point of trying to be a Christian . Why not just live your life the way you want to , and then when people zap out of thin air , change your life . It 's ridiculous and sends the wrong message . Plus , the writing is for second graders with no redeeming characteristics to it . But I really do n't think the author 's care at this point ( seeing how many millions they 've made printing lies ) . My recommendation is to read the bible instead of this series ; then you 'll get truth and the bible is probably shorter ( and much better writing ) .

My professor dumped this book as the course textbook 1/4 of the way through the semester due to the never - ending left - leaning political commentary . This is no serious review of the Middle East , just a socialist - based fantasy on how THINGS SHOULD BE . The author himself proclaims that accuracy is n't always important , its the idea that matters . This book is a joke , I looked for something serious , unbiased to aid me in learning more about the Middle East but this book does n't present anything new and its political leanings are just to the left of Stalin .

50527,1,"Seemed like he was in a hurry ... The book is n't good at all . I 'm sorry . I loved I am Legend and seeing the list of books this guy has written which had been developed into classic horror movies ( Hell House included ) I was really excited to read this . I have heard many complaints about the book from calling it "" soft porn "" to "" sick soft porn "" and then even being offended by the sacrilege present in the tale . Sacrilege in a book called ... Hell House is probably something you need to come to terms with before picking it up . Attacking the author because of the content is really something that is not necessary . I doubt these were Mathis ' "" sexual fantasies "" in the book but more likely his idea of melding something pleasurable together with something terrifying . It is an effective way to convey horror to a reader . Similar to enacting horrible violence on children , or worse , babies in cinema ( try watching the Hills Have Eyes without being on the edge of your seat while the villains in the movie dangle the fate of an infant in your face ) . Mathis should not be condemned for content . Here is what he did right . He took the idea of a haunted house and brought it into the world of science . Much like I am Legend used science to define its vampires , Hell House uses science to define hauntings and it is very well researched and believable within the framework of the story . The bad parts may be more numerous . His characterization is horrid . There are four characters really and their personalities do not define them . You will remember Barrett by his limp , Fishcer by his fear , Florence by her religious beliefs , and Edith ... well because there is no one else . They are paper thin and have no real motivations . The pacing seems poor too . A lot of moments are left on revelations in the point of view characters mind which that character has not fully processed because the chapter ends before they can relay it and all of its profound meaning to you , the reader . As a matter of fact the revelations themselves , when all is said and done , are really pretty dull . There is also a habit characters have , when going into great lengths of exposition that goes on for pages , to cup their hands around a coffee cup . It seems too much like a commercial for me ! Anyway , the book hardly slows down for characterization or details and we get very few vivid descriptions in the book . Sometimes I wanted to know what things looked like , I wanted imagery not just exposition for pages . What was it about the atmosphere that , say Fischer found so scary ? We needed the scenes to be better developed . By the end I was so tired of lines like:""God do you know what this means?""""What?""""I ca n't tell you now but it 's freakin ' awesome!""That exchange is not in the book but you will find many similar moments throughout .

I expect an Atlas to use maps to explain more rather than words . The maps that are in the book are good , but numerous sections do not have one . The book is split into sections / topics written by individual persons . However , in many sections the text ends in mid - sentence , as if several pages were forgotten about in each section or as if there was some arbitrary cutoff on the # of words per section.of this approx 200 page book , sentence cutoffs appear on these pages .

50547,1,"Acupressure Techniques : A Self Help Guide This book is almost useless for helping someone understand how to use acupressure to alleviate physical symptoms . As a licensed massage therapist who already knows quite a bit about acupressure , I am always willing to learn more about any kind of bodywork . I had hoped to be able to pass on some ideas to my clients for self help but this book was definitely not it . The book gives some accupoints for specific problems , some of these are "" golden points "" able to stand alone in use , but others are not . The book gives no order to use these in and furthermore does not specify if all or any of the points are to be used together in sequence , or not . Also , it does't tell where the points are EXACTLY . There are really too many flaws to go into here . Acupressure is very complex , this book tries to simplify it to the point that it looks like some goofy folklore advocating some bad mojo",185,0,0.2236413460854891,0.07360034627212565,0.0005555555555556058,0.0005555555555556058,0.0005555555555556058,0.0005555555555556058,0.0005555555555556058,0.15310788620999968,0.0005555555555556058,0.0005555555555556058,0.0005555555555556058,0.0005555555555556058,0.0005555555555556058,0.0005555555555556058,0.0005555555555556058,0.0005555555555556058,0.06496615526956895,0.0005555555555556058,0.0005555555555556058,0.0005555555555556058,0.0005555555555556058,0.060687603653679444,0.0005555555555556058,0.0005555555555556058,0.0005555555555556058,0.0005555555555556058,0.0005555555555556058,0.0005555555555556058,0.0005555555555556058,0.0005555555555556058,0.0005555555555556058,0.0005555555555556058,0.0005555555555556058,0.0005555555555556058,0.0005555555555556058,0.0005555555555556058,0.28526817414095,0.0005555555555556058,0.0005555555555556058,0.0005555555555556058,0.0005555555555556058,0.0005555555555556058,0.0005555555555556058,0.0005555555555556058,0.0005555555555556058,0.0005555555555556058,0.11483959947929616,0.0005555555555556058,0.0005555555555556058,0.0005555555555556058,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

50559,1,"There 's a sucker born every minute This book is an excellent example of how creationists approach science : write a book with a lot of bafflegab that sounds scientific but is actually devoid of any meaningful content , and then finish up by concluding that evolution is impossible . What a bunch of baloney . First of all , evolution , in the sense of "" common descent , "" is not impossible . Even ID - iot superstars Michael Behe , Stephen Meyer , and Jonathan Wells have admitted as much . ( See a summary of their recent testimony in the Kansas biology curriculum hearings in the evolution / creationism forum at the West Virginia Gazette . ( wvgazettemail ) ( put "" /forums "" after com ) So any ID - iot who thinks all that bafflegab about irreducible complexity ( IC ) and the nonsense in this film is the death knell of evolution is simply ignorant . Man evolved from non - human ancestors . Get over it . Thaxton in particular ought to read that summary , since he himself was one of the witnesses and looked particularly ID - iotic . In any case , the empirical data discussed in this book is indeed nothing but bafflegab . Talking about the allegedly empirical foundation for intelligent design makes it sound deliciously scientific , especially to poorly educated ID - iots , who generally are clueless about real science ; but even if the empirical data is accurate , it 's nothing but a facade , because it has nothing to do with the book 's main conclusion . For example , imagine your neighbor told you that his dog could play Beethoven concertos on the piano . Skeptical , you ask for proof . "" Simple , "" your neighbor replies . "" See , here 's my dog , and there 's my piano . "" Only a moron would accept that as "" proof , "" and yet ID - iot Christians are more than happy to accept exactly that kind of "" proof "" from ID - iotic films like this . The problem with your neighbor 's "" proof "" is that it proves only the existence of the dog and the existence of the piano . Neither of those issues , however , was the real cause of your skepticism , so the "" proof "" was entirely meaningless . The critical issue , of course , was not the mere existence of the dog and the piano , but rather the ability of the dog to play the piano , and your neighbor 's "" proof "" was completely silent on that issue . Again , only a moron would accept evidence of mere existence as proof of piano - playing ability . In this book , there 's a lot of talk about how complex certain biological systems are . That is nothing but meaningless bafflegab , because the mere existence of complex systems is not a disputed issue . The disputed issue is how those systems came into being , and on that issue the book 's "" evidence "" is completely silent . This book was designed to fool poorly educated , easily impressed ID - iots . Judging from the five - star reviews , it seems to have succeeded . Well , there 's a sucker born every minute , and apparently a lot of them are found in evangelical churches and seminaries . In one of the very first evolution debates , Thomas Huxley accused Bishop Wilberforce of using his intellectual and oratorical gifts to mislead and bamboozle people . Things have n't changed much since then . Instead of meaningful evidence , this book substitutes a God - of - the - gaps argument . "" Gee , look how complex it is .

50587,1,"Not Recommended Having read ( and thoroughly enjoyed ) Levitt 's Freakonomics , I picked up "" Hidden Order : The Economics of Everyday Life "" looking for more of the same . Unfortunately , I was sadly disappointed . I get the impression the author intended to write a Freakonomics - type book , but was only able to come up with 40 pages of material ( located at the end of the book ) . Facing an irate publisher , he then filled in the initial 290 pages with his old Economics lecture notes . As a result , readers who have taken an elementary economics course will find much of the material repetitive , while those who have not will most likely find the material too confusing to be of any real use . ( Despite the glowing accolades on the cover , the author 's explanations are no better than those available in a standard textbook.)The author also posits end - of - chapter questions for the reader to ruminate upon , but does not provide any answers . Aside from formal textbooks where such questions are intended to be assigned to students , such tactics are unconscionable . Of course , the author may be priming the pump for sales of a "" Hidden Order Supplement"" . A final negative point is the author 's tone , which is frequently condescending towards the reader ( e.g. telling the reader they would not understand the math behind a given theory , so it will not even be presented ) . While this may be true for a layperson reading the book , being talked down to certainly does nothing to build their confidence or cultivate their interest in the subject matter . Overall , if you can borrow a copy from a friend or a library , the last 40 pages are worth reading . Otherwise , save your time and money . Reviewer 's background : B.Sc .

50589,1,"Interesting Thesis , but overlooking some important points Mr. Friedman 's book begins with an interesting thesis , defining morality and its definition within a context of economic growth . The idea that economic growth or stagnation effects the mindsets of the people living in that time period is a logical argument that Friedman often well supports with historical facts . However , the exceptions to his argument make me wonder if he really believes in his own thesis , or if he just felt the need to write a book . Furthermore , for every chapter in the book , there seem to be at least one or more flawed arguments or points that , with a little thorough thought or research , do n't make sense or can easily be disproven . With these things being the case , I find Friedman 's argument a little hard to buy . The entire book seems to build up to the final chapter , which Friedman uses to make policy recommendations that would aid in economic growth ; this final chapter could have stood alone from the book entirely , however , because the evidence in the book an his arguments elsewhere in the book ( ie . the importance of education ) do not add or support his final policy recommendations . His policy recommendations could have easily been listed by students in an economics class as responses to the question "" What should the government do to promote economic growth ? "" They do n't push the argument forward or indicate anything that has n't already been suggested in the past , nor do they give suggestions as to how to go about implementing his policies .",289,0,0.38885443904229716,0.00046511627906980097,0.00046511627906980097,0.00046511627906980097,0.00046511627906980097,0.00046511627906980097,0.02372093023255703,0.00046511627906980097,0.00046511627906980097,0.00046511627906980097,0.00046511627906980097,0.00046511627906980097,0.00046511627906980097,0.00046511627906980097,0.00046511627906980097,0.00046511627906980097,0.00046511627906980097,0.02662606864895725,0.00046511627906980097,0.00046511627906980097,0.00046511627906980097,0.00046511627906980097,0.02423187024412559,0.00046511627906980097,0.00046511627906980097,0.00046511627906980097,0.00046511627906980097,0.00046511627906980097,0.00046511627906980097,0.023892074109346437,0.00046511627906980097,0.025122922130394087,0.00046511627906980097,0.00046511627906980097,0.00046511627906980097,0.00046511627906980097,0.42079937833370684,0.00046511627906980097,0.00046511627906980097,0.00046511627906980097,0.00046511627906980097,0.00046511627906980097,0.00046511627906980097,0.00046511627906980097,0.00046511627906980097,0.047217433537683956,0.00046511627906980097,0.00046511627906980097,0.00046511627906980097,0.00046511627906980097,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
50602,1,"Worst book in the series , including the prequels . Some may disagree , and in fact , many have asked me why I disliked this one so much ; so , here is why:- scratch ' plotting ' ... by this point in the story , ' plodding ' is more accurate . - caracatures over characters . A staple of the series , 2d characters ; but by this point , when new characters keep getting introduced this late in the story , it becomes an annoyance , a drag and overkill . - virtually zero gain . the entire first half of the book is a rescue mission for a minor character and the mission , once accomplished ( or not ) is forgotten by the end of the book . The third fourth of the book finally starts to swing thigns back to the original LB premise of end times doom and gloom thanks to the horrific judgments ; sadly , it 's very boring and slow . However ... - ... the book does n't get good until the last fourth . And that , my friends , is not good for the overall quality of this entry in the series . By this point , it 's obvious that the authors were REALLY stretching it . However , as I said , things got really good in the last few chapters and led into ' Armageddon ' , one of the best books in the series . How ironic . Thumbs way down for Left Behind : The Remnant .

He always strikes me as someone who potters around never really interacting with people who then goes home and writes about it . He seems more at home studying statistics ( which he includes everywhere ) and drawing his own facile conclusions from these statistics . I always imagine him stuck in his room reading his newspaper , surfing the net and smugly summing up his brief interactions with people in the real world .

50636,1,"Long on drama , woefully short on credibility While I applaud Ms. Lawrence for educating fans on the gross injustices within the Hendrix family and for having a commendable understanding of Janie Hendrix 's psychological make up that is lost even on many who are within her orbit , there are some very serious credibility problems here . While even the idle Hendrix fan knows Jimi was born in King County Hospital , ( Now Harbor View ) Lawrence states he was born at the home of a family friend.(Ouch ) Jimi is quoted allegedly verbatum throughout the book but from some alledged tapes of interviews that no one has seen or heard and that Lawrence conveniently plans on destroying so ' no one can profit from them' . Meanwhile cigarette packs ( yes , cigarette packs ) and necklaces are being sold via ebay or to private collectors allegedly having belonged to Hendrix , siting Ms. Lawrence as the previous owner and source of authenticity . At one point she aledgedly quotes Hendrix as saying:""The LSD passed around San Francisco was a fabulous discovery for me , I 'd taken acid in London but .... "" Aside from Jimi 's use of the word ' fabulous ' being at best incredulous , the fact that Hendrix had already tried LSD in New York in 1996 before going to England and subsequently Monterey is common knowledge among afficianados and again makes all of these alledged direct quotes questionable . Those of you who have listened to and read the hundreds of hours of interviews available through collectors , official releases and press clippings will also find some of the wording of these alledged quotes that the book , and the credibility of it 's author are based on , extremely suspect . At one point Ms. Lawrence even offers an aledged quote from Hendrix 's mother who passed away in 1958:""Jimi baby "" she told her son "" I have to escape this "" While quotes like this can illicit an emotional response from the average reader , they are clearly fictional . Throughout the book people close to Jimi are referenced but very sparsely quoted , if at all . I shared the recount of Jimi 's trip to Berkeley as a small child ( Pg.5 ) with Jimi 's aunt Delores and she laughed openly and wondered aloud where people come up with these stories . This from a woman who was actually there and involved in planning said trip . While making a reference to Ernestine Benson and misstakenly referring to her husband Cornel as "" Bill "" , Lawrence again allegedly quotes Hendrix in lieu of an actual interview with the Benson 's who are both still living and have incredible first hand insights having lived with the Hendrix 's . Lawrence 's assertion that Hendrix committed suicide simply because his journal was left out is no less ridiculous than Jimi 's adopted stepsister Janie 's claim that Jimi did n't OD . Lawrence then stops just short of gleefully giving herself credit for Monika 's suicide , but the jist is clear . This book is more than a bit narcissistic with Lawrence lauding herself as much as she does her subject . While proclaiming herself to be a close confident of Hendrix ' the general consensus is that she was n't around that much , if people even know who she is at all . For a much more well researched and credible look into Jimi 's life read Electric Gypsy or even more so , the new book Room Full Of Mirrors by Charles Cross . The Man , The Magic , The Truth , while very dramatic , is rife with glaring inaccuracies and is for the most part a novel about the author and her subject , not a biography or a reliable historical record . Unless these alledged tapes that are widely quoted throughout the entire book are made available , their legitimacy and the legitimacy of the book will forever be questioned .

50640,1,"very disappointing ... I have been reading a series of autobiographical accounts of modern day warriors and had high hopes for this title . As others have pointed out , Coughlin 's ego can be suffocating at times . This could be forgiven if it were the books only flaw . Alas it is not . The writing is amateurish at best and the author 's overuse of adjective and hyperbole is very distracting . The language is disjointed and unnatural as if it were written with the heavy use of a thesaurus . Again this could be forgiven as we 're reading this book for a soldier 's account , not that of an English grad student . This book offers a stark contrast in comparison with Nathaniel Fick 's "" One Bullet Away . "" Whereas Fick seems to be an intelligent , thoughtful and humble warrior whose primary concern is the welfare of his men , Coughlin conveys himself as a shallow intellect with more concern for personal glory and satisfaction than anything else . He is a team player when he hand picks the team and considers them worthy of his own company . You can not know a person from reading their writing but Coughlin 's character development is very superficial . His attempts to convey a "" human side "" are unbelievable and seem grossly contrived . This is a great contrast to the character development in "" One Bullet . "" There is no connection between author and reader in "" Shooter . "" Coughlin does not develop the role players either . In "" One Bullet "" you really feel the brotherhood developed among the officer , his NCOs and the enlisted men . Additionally , Coughlin 's demeaning descriptions of his support staff ( non - trigger pullers ) is tedious and only reinforces doubts about his team ethic . To make matters worse the action is n't as well developed as in other titles . The author 's self - congratulatory tone and emphasis on personal exploits , with plenty of after - action chest thumping , obscures the view of battle . He spends little time on the finer elements of sniper tradecraft , training and shooting . This can be found elsewhere . Overall this book was a great disappointment . If only a fraction of Coughlin 's self - acclaimed exploits are true , then he is a remarkable sniper . He should let his accomplishments speak for themselves and not try to beat us over the head with them",433,0,0.0003278688524590471,0.0932741034045158,0.0003278688524590471,0.0003278688524590471,0.03693559435137511,0.0003278688524590471,0.0003278688524590471,0.22993498108865082,0.0003278688524590471,0.0003278688524590471,0.0003278688524590471,0.0003278688524590471,0.0003278688524590471,0.0003278688524590471,0.0003278688524590471,0.0003278688524590471,0.0003278688524590471,0.0003278688524590471,0.0003278688524590471,0.0003278688524590471,0.0003278688524590471,0.05309132645163732,0.0003278688524590471,0.019273296435961044,0.0003278688524590471,0.0003278688524590471,0.0003278688524590471,0.0003278688524590471,0.0003278688524590471,0.0003278688524590471,0.0003278688524590471,0.0003278688524590471,0.044620200142048184,0.0003278688524590471,0.0003278688524590471,0.0003278688524590471,0.34718892416921165,0.06758459131914697,0.0003278688524590471,0.04422488806224575,0.0003278688524590471,0.0003278688524590471,0.0003278688524590471,0.0003278688524590471,0.029015893815162216,0.022069315514142197,0.0003278688524590471,0.0003278688524590471,0.0003278688524590471,0.0003278688524590471,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0
50648,1,"Soul by Soul by Walter Johnson The principle question that arises from a reading of quot;Soul by Soul quot ; by Walter Johnson is why was this book written ? It is touted as history , yet not only does it lack any original historical material , it also lacks any discernable historical facts . Rather than history , quot;Soul by Soul quot ; seems to be a mean - spirited , emotional tract designed to promote two fundamental ideas : 1 . that white people living in the antebellum South were universally loathsome , brutish and cruel and 2 . that black people living in the antebellum South were universally noble , good and abused . To support his views , Professor Johnson strings together a loose collection of repetitious snippets from antebellum abolitionist literature and excerpts from gossipy litigation proceedings . His personal contribution is represented by his miraculous ability to enter the psyche of the book 's long deceased characters and divine their true , but unspoken , motives and thoughts . Quite a feat for any historian ! One loses count of the number of times that the reader is treated to white people using their quot;probing fingers quot ; in this book . Fortunately , in between probes , the reader can be shocked by the quot;killing fields of the lower South , quot ; the quot;historical sexualization of black bodies , quot ; the quot;slaveholders ' inevitable failure to live through the stolen bodies of their slaves , quot ; and the quot;brutish perogatives of whiteness . quot ; This is heavy , hate - filled stuff worthy of a TV mini - series but it is out of place in a supposedly serious history text . I live in a former slave quarter in New Orleans . In the antebellum period , this building and its resident slaves were , interestingly enough , owned by a free black who was financially ruined in 1863 by the Emancipation Proclamation . As an amateur historian , I would have thought that a book about the New Orleans slave market would contain some pertinent historical facts about these markets . What were their addresses ? What percentage of their customers were black ? What percentage were white ? How many slaves did the typical New Orleans household have ? How were they fed and clothed ? What were their working hours ? These are basic questions that should have been addressed but instead , the reader is given an emotionally charged , repetitious , boring rehash of tired , previously published material . In short , this book , for the most part , reads like a rambling , overly long sermon . Anyone seeking serious scholarship on the subject of slavery would do well to look elsewhere and should consider reading the quot;Slave Narratives quot ; compiled by the Federal Writers Project , quot;Time on the Cross quot ; by Robert Fogel and Stanley Engerman and quot;The Slave Trade quot ; by Hugh Thomas . The first of these is a collection of interviews of former slaves performed by the W.P.A. in the 1930 's . The latter two works contain original historical research and both deal with the facts of slavery , not the emotions",551,0,0.0002247191011236148,0.08618918807234353,0.0002247191011236148,0.01272616558160097,0.014389615486692073,0.0002247191011236148,0.0002247191011236148,0.0002247191011236148,0.0002247191011236148,0.0002247191011236148,0.0002247191011236148,0.0002247191011236148,0.0002247191011236148,0.0002247191011236148,0.0002247191011236148,0.0002247191011236148,0.0002247191011236148,0.0002247191011236148,0.0002247191011236148,0.0002247191011236148,0.0002247191011236148,0.0002247191011236148,0.039991441377786215,0.029202721075577535,0.01617304441286309,0.0002247191011236148,0.0002247191011236148,0.0002247191011236148,0.0002247191011236148,0.0002247191011236148,0.0002247191011236148,0.0002247191011236148,0.0002247191011236148,0.0002247191011236148,0.0002247191011236148,0.1090139984012262,0.22802285431359762,0.3468567014111035,0.03723236588786829,0.0002247191011236148,0.0002247191011236148,0.0002247191011236148,0.0002247191011236148,0.0002247191011236148,0.027699864044486322,0.043962714092157386,0.0002247191011236148,0.0002247191011236148,0.0002247191011236148,0.0002247191011236148,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0
50661,1,"A Review As Ugly As This Novel It truly is the best war fiction regarding WWII if you have never read ANY other fiction regarding WWII . I love war fiction and non - fiction and beside parroting the Time Magazine blurb prominently displayed in the novel I can not even come close to understanding why anyone , let alone review after review , would even come close to that stupefying conclusion . To me it is the best example of intellectual snobbery that critics like to pat themselves on the back with . Only they understand and you lesser intellects are not capable of appreciating . What it is , is a bloated , narcisstic , misogynistic waste of time . Of course any piece of literature is subjective , but to me , this critically acclaimed work fails on every level that a novel should , regardless of genre . Unless you love James Joyce ( another bad writer lorded over us by the critically elite ) , I think most readers expect some sort of plot development . Do n't expect that here . How about engaging characters that develop and grow throughout the novel ? You better pick up something else . It seems to me the reader should at least be invested in one of the character 's outcome . Far too pedestrian a thought if you "" get "" this art . If I ca n't have any of that how about writing a character that is even remotely likable ? Forget it non - ivy leaguer ! I was rooting for the Japanese to kill them all , so at least their "" loved "" ones at home would be spared of these nearly universally despicable human beings . The only thing that propelled me to finish was to get to the ending that would perhaps tie together the painful experience of reading these soldier 's hateful ruminations while , oh by the way , a war was being fought around them . Nope , no big ending either . It just ends . Yes , I have heard that the plodding ugliness and pointlessness of the entire book is to symbolize war itself . Give me a break . While this may be bad news for us common folk duped into reading it , it certainly is good news for Tom Clancy . His last two decades of literature are just misunderstood genius depicting the banality of human existence and not bad writing at all .",424,0,0.00025641025641028666,0.08112849876600021,0.00025641025641028666,0.00025641025641028666,0.00025641025641028666,0.01295303528235649,0.00025641025641028666,0.058186805170048934,0.00025641025641028666,0.00025641025641028666,0.00025641025641028666,0.00025641025641028666,0.19583810386886652,0.00025641025641028666,0.009314364810588487,0.00025641025641028666,0.00025641025641028666,0.00025641025641028666,0.00025641025641028666,0.00025641025641028666,0.00025641025641028666,0.00025641025641028666,0.00025641025641028666,0.00025641025641028666,0.00025641025641028666,0.02845159339036124,0.00025641025641028666,0.00025641025641028666,0.00025641025641028666,0.00025641025641028666,0.00025641025641028666,0.051749515418921394,0.06701688663345985,0.00025641025641028666,0.04858997830898234,0.00025641025641028666,0.3017016321458369,0.00025641025641028666,0.00025641025641028666,0.00025641025641028666,0.00025641025641028666,0.00025641025641028666,0.00025641025641028666,0.00025641025641028666,0.1350695862045767,0.00025641025641028666,0.00025641025641028666,0.00025641025641028666,0.00025641025641028666,0.00025641025641028666,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

Tanya Holland is a beautiful Black woman , but I feel has gone too far out of the way to create "" innovative and different "" recipes so much that they are not appealing and certainly should not be categorized as soul food . The price is outrageous for the handful of recipes that were chosen for this cookbook . I collect african american / soul food cookbooks among others .

One that would be useful to families in their everyday cooking .",278,0,0.232984147638325,0.12924044752862016,0.00046511627906980775,0.00046511627906980775,0.09184314013610127,0.00046511627906980775,0.00046511627906980775,0.07220877326821977,0.00046511627906980775,0.00046511627906980775,0.09081662270502253,0.00046511627906980775,0.00046511627906980775,0.00046511627906980775,0.00046511627906980775,0.00046511627906980775,0.00046511627906980775,0.00046511627906980775,0.00046511627906980775,0.00046511627906980775,0.00046511627906980775,0.00046511627906980775,0.00046511627906980775,0.00046511627906980775,0.00046511627906980775,0.00046511627906980775,0.00046511627906980775,0.00046511627906980775,0.00046511627906980775,0.00046511627906980775,0.00046511627906980775,0.11510881828803063,0.00046511627906980775,0.00046511627906980775,0.00046511627906980775,0.07167950640045372,0.06905539118141928,0.00046511627906980775,0.00046511627906980775,0.0569433904050152,0.00046511627906980775,0.00046511627906980775,0.00046511627906980775,0.00046511627906980775,0.00046511627906980775,0.05151511128600018,0.00046511627906980775,0.00046511627906980775,0.00046511627906980775,0.00046511627906980775,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
50697,1,"Could n't get past the first few chapters ....... The author is certainly writing for a target audience ....... as one other reviewer said , white , upper - middle - class , female would - be mystics . I found the stories of life on the commune mind - numbing ( then again , I was born in Berkeley in 1970 , so that hippie commune kumbayah stuff reminds me of eating carob when I was a kid ) and the rest of what I did manage to read alienating ....... zzzzzzzzzzzz ....... I am not saying this is a bad book at all , just that it 's focus was so narrow that it completely lost my interest . The language was so fuzzy and woo - woo that it just irritated my Gen X ( for lack of a better word ) postpunk sensibility . It 's a shame , too , as I was really looking forward to this book and hoping it would assist me in reconciling my own struggle between feminism and spirituality .

50701,1,"Tediuous , repetitive , and altogether poorly written Sheppard 's attempt to capture the "" American youth angst "" failed miserably . Instead what he created was a novel that felt more like a chore to get through . I never developed any connection or understanding of the characters . Each chapter seemed to stumble into the next , with the end as predictable as the next expletive Sheppard was going to use to give his protagonists a hard edge . You 'd do better saving your money , driving to the nearest mall , and find the kid in the Anarchy T - shirt looking sullen , because it appears that is all Sheppard did in this work .

50716,1,"A Rather Plodding Morality Tale I like John Grisham , but THE KING OF TORTS was a slow - moving disappointment . Grisham is obviously making an argument for tort reform in this novel , which is fine , but he ends up putting the message above the story . Grisham devotes much of this novel to a young plaintiffs ' lawyer and his new law firm dedicated to class action lawsuits . This provides Grisham with an excuse to explain , in agonizing detail , how tort lawyers sue big companies and collect huge fees . Grisham also produces scene after scene describing the enormous wealth of class action lawyers , and how they put their own greed above the interests of their clients . In the end , none of this adds up to an engaging storyline . It does n't help that the young lawyer in this novel is a rather unlikable person that Grisham is obviously setting up for a fall . Since I did n't care for this character , I found the storyline of THE KING OF TORTS to be largely uninvolving . This novel is also rather preachy and heavy - handed in tone . I personally dislike class action lawsuits , but I read novels for entertainment , not to validate my own political beliefs . Although this book was decently written , I just did n't find the story interesting enough to recommend . For a better version of this story , I would suggest A CIVIL ACTION by Jonathan Harr .",261,0,0.00045454545454549824,0.05308715646083925,0.00045454545454549824,0.00045454545454549824,0.00045454545454549824,0.00045454545454549824,0.00045454545454549824,0.085890257032358,0.024905756890192494,0.00045454545454549824,0.021050435707323026,0.00045454545454549824,0.00045454545454549824,0.00045454545454549824,0.00045454545454549824,0.00045454545454549824,0.00045454545454549824,0.00045454545454549824,0.00045454545454549824,0.00045454545454549824,0.00045454545454549824,0.2960127489152494,0.00045454545454549824,0.00045454545454549824,0.00045454545454549824,0.00045454545454549824,0.00045454545454549824,0.00045454545454549824,0.00045454545454549824,0.098439655538548,0.00045454545454549824,0.00045454545454549824,0.00045454545454549824,0.00045454545454549824,0.00045454545454549824,0.00045454545454549824,0.339723836254407,0.00045454545454549824,0.06179924411017179,0.00045454545454549824,0.00045454545454549824,0.00045454545454549824,0.00045454545454549824,0.00045454545454549824,0.00045454545454549824,0.00045454545454549824,0.00045454545454549824,0.00045454545454549824,0.00045454545454549824,0.00045454545454549824,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
50717,1,"Owen : World 's Worst Husband . Owen does a remarkable job of making himself look like a complete jerk . He comes off as arrogant , showing little empathy towards Debra 's problems earlier on in their marriage ( eating disorder , depression , social anxiety ) . He writes about very private matters in his book that have nothing to do with the legal trouble Debra was in , but instead are very embarrassing to her . He comes across as a husband with no compassion . It 's ironic that he goes on and on about Debra 's poor choices in boyfriends over the years , and how they were always so controlling of her .... and then he goes on to tell us how mad he was because he was a tidy person and Debra did n't keep the house tidy ... and he did n't approve of the way she dressed ! ! Seems to me that he was no different than the other guys she dated . He repeatedly reminds us of how smart he is , his GPA , jobs , earning potential , etc ... but then admits that when they separated , he sticks Debra with the credit card bill that still had a balance from their wedding and honeymoon to pay off ! He says it was in her name , so she can have it ! Owen shows how little a man he really is in this book . Debra did have horrible things happen to her as a kid , and maybe if she could have married a man with compassion in his heart , she would n't have gone down the road she did . I feel very sorry for Debra after reading this book",298,0,0.2082362427013443,0.0004255319148936565,0.040734569025669305,0.029284144335685616,0.0004255319148936565,0.0004255319148936565,0.0004255319148936565,0.14966536770198546,0.0004255319148936565,0.0004255319148936565,0.0004255319148936565,0.0004255319148936565,0.1515977116833909,0.0004255319148936565,0.0004255319148936565,0.0004255319148936565,0.0622913794979591,0.0004255319148936565,0.0004255319148936565,0.03884666773820743,0.0004255319148936565,0.0004255319148936565,0.0004255319148936565,0.0004255319148936565,0.0004255319148936565,0.0004255319148936565,0.0004255319148936565,0.0004255319148936565,0.0004255319148936565,0.0004255319148936565,0.0004255319148936565,0.0004255319148936565,0.0004255319148936565,0.0004255319148936565,0.051268841090229965,0.0004255319148936565,0.15240109593071494,0.0004255319148936565,0.0004255319148936565,0.0004255319148936565,0.0352445128135478,0.03882210605933767,0.0004255319148936565,0.0004255319148936565,0.0004255319148936565,0.0004255319148936565,0.025437148655968616,0.0004255319148936565,0.0004255319148936565,0.0004255319148936565,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

If you happen across it one day on the street , it wo n't do any harm to read it . But I ca n't recommend paying money for something you already know , or can get for a better deal",154,0,0.0004651162790697924,0.0004651162790697924,0.0004651162790697924,0.0004651162790697924,0.019928286315620717,0.0004651162790697924,0.0004651162790697924,0.09796600775329226,0.0004651162790697924,0.0004651162790697924,0.0004651162790697924,0.0004651162790697924,0.19938359078313436,0.0004651162790697924,0.06894906187810874,0.0004651162790697924,0.0004651162790697924,0.0004651162790697924,0.0004651162790697924,0.0004651162790697924,0.0004651162790697924,0.0004651162790697924,0.02536749622728681,0.0004651162790697924,0.0004651162790697924,0.0004651162790697924,0.0004651162790697924,0.0004651162790697924,0.0004651162790697924,0.0004651162790697924,0.0004651162790697924,0.0004651162790697924,0.0004651162790697924,0.0004651162790697924,0.0004651162790697924,0.0004651162790697924,0.3526847969844323,0.05061513243654155,0.0004651162790697924,0.0361080880716151,0.0004651162790697924,0.0004651162790697924,0.03430802855135895,0.0004651162790697924,0.09608485983581734,0.0004651162790697924,0.0004651162790697924,0.0004651162790697924,0.0004651162790697924,0.0004651162790697924,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

50735,1,"Boring This book provides nothing new . It is centered on the whole idea of setting up your retirement accounts so they automatically deduct from your paycheck . If you have 401k , duh , it does that automatically ... anyway , boring . It also says to save money , do n't use credit cards , pay yourself , blah , blah , blah . Oh yeh , if you save early you will be a millionaire in like forty years ... zzzz . Ok , it did help me by reminding me about the interest rates in banks . One idea was to put the emergency funds in a money market account which offers a higher interest rate than a regular savings account . Upon reading this , I decided to do this and doing this made me realize the dismal .2 % I 've been earning on my saving account .

50743,1,"Another Awful Book Let me start by saying that I would have given this book zero stars if I could . The reviews I 've read are all true . This book is boring , extremely repetitive and a waste of time . The only reason I finished it was because I paid for it . I truly believe that Danielle Steel has lost her gift of writing . She has not published a good book in a long time . I also think that she 's lost her editor , because to me , a good editor would n't let books like this be printed . This story pretty much follows stories she 's done before except it 's told from the guy 's point of view . There 's the rich guy , Charlie , who ca n't seem to find the "" perfect "" girl to marry . He finds a flaw with every one he dates . He lost his parents at a young age , his sister left school to raise him , and just before he graduated college , she died of a brain tumor . So of course he 's afraid that anyone he gets close to will die or leave him . Then there 's rich Adam , whose wife left him and took their two children with her . It was a bitter divorce , so he has no desire to ever marry again . He dates girls half his age and never stays with one long . His parents blame him for the divorce . Every time he visits them , his mother let 's him know what a huge disappointment he is to the family . The last of the trio is Gary , a struggling artist . He has no desire to ever marry or date . The three men spend the month of August each year on Charlie 's yacht , partying and going on and on about how they do n't want commitments . Well of course , each one meets someone , they start to date , they argue , they break up , they have their epiphany and everyone lives happily ever after . Same old story . Danielle Steel should stop writing . You ca n't tell me she does n't have enough money to live on . I for one will not read any more of her books , even a paperback , and I wo n't even bother renting them from the library . I wo n't waste my time having to check the book out and worrying about getting it back on time .

Preston , it seems , is only capable of going for the jugular . HZ shows no evidence of research ( it lacks even a trace of a bibliography ) , and attests little more than a rudimentary grasp , on the part of its author , of the history , epidemiology , or politics of Ebola ( no more than one might glean from any half decent article on the topic ) . From its opening page stroll through the air - lock doors of a bio - containment research lab , to its closing page ' death - defying ' romp through Kitum Cave ( how very brave of you , RP ! ) , HZ is in full pandering - for - the - cameras mode .

( another eye roll ) ben is being a troll my guess is he s cheating on her , but seriously reading that chapter where they go on this really uncomfortable date just made me want to scream at the book ! it was so annoying.the only thing keeping me reading right now is the cammie storyline , i want her to confront her dad and find out what happened to her mom.right now i m giving the book 2 stars , after i finish the book ( if i ever do ) ill come back and edit this . if anyone wants to take me out of my misery and tell me what happened to cammies mom , be my guest ! lol***EDIT * * * it got a lot better after page 101 , the Sam plot got developed ( a bit overdone , tacky and stalkerish , i mean a life size cut out ? a 100 cell phones ? come on , what a waste of money . she could have donated all that $ $ $ to some charity in peru and impressed her guy a lot more . the cammie story is getting juicier , and parker may have a bona fide crush on sam . i still think ben is a creep . well i guess i wo nt spoiler everything lol . i 'm still not done yet . ill continue this after i finish.***FINAL EDIT * * * after a good middle , the book took a nosedive . the story of cammie 's mother was horribly disappointing . i officially HATE ben now and i m getting more and more sick of anna for even being into him . what kind of guy tries to make a girl feel weird and uptight for thinking that sex between two people should be special ? ? ? that just really turned me off . the girl who wins a contest by wearing nothing but body paint to the party ? ? okay , this is a book that 12 year olds read , did we seriously need to hear that ? the best way to get liked is to get naked?sigh ... the two stars rating stands . sorry",594,0,0.07331657241918337,0.09338670976731957,0.0001754385964912455,0.0001754385964912455,0.0001754385964912455,0.035888217386108805,0.008947368437117327,0.0001754385964912455,0.0001754385964912455,0.0001754385964912455,0.0001754385964912455,0.0001754385964912455,0.14620998103785068,0.0001754385964912455,0.0001754385964912455,0.0001754385964912455,0.1218738701614033,0.0001754385964912455,0.0001754385964912455,0.009953907901313204,0.0001754385964912455,0.091885962843726,0.0001754385964912455,0.0001754385964912455,0.01993066258864221,0.009990812521661674,0.0001754385964912455,0.0001754385964912455,0.0001754385964912455,0.0001754385964912455,0.0001754385964912455,0.0001754385964912455,0.027984363117627822,0.0001754385964912455,0.0001754385964912455,0.0388877663705359,0.2641165244492959,0.0001754385964912455,0.0001754385964912455,0.01943916499282572,0.01098588420115257,0.010539704156152574,0.01087305396387239,0.0001754385964912455,0.0001754385964912455,0.0001754385964912455,0.0001754385964912455,0.0001754385964912455,0.0001754385964912455,0.0001754385964912455,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

50789,1,"Wish I could get my money back ... As a strong proponent of attachment parenting and a rather radical unschooler , this book was a BIG disappointment ! ! ! I bought this book after reading the reviews and wish I had n't paid more than $ 1 for it . While the title "" The Unprocessed Child "" accurately describes Laurie 's upbringing , this book should n't be grouped with other unschooling literature . The author , while cherishing the close bond she has with her daughter , reminds me of the mother in "" Love You Forever "" who sneaks across town and climbs into her grown son 's room at night to spend time with him -- sweet but a bit creepy . The fact that she admits that she even went to college at the same time as her daughter so she could spend more time with Laurie pretty much says it all . The mother clearly has her own issues that I hope she allows herself to work through and heal from now that she 's not spending 24/7 with her only child . We have been unschooling each of our four children since birth --challenging temperments and all -- and I feel very privileged to spend so much time with them as they discover how exciting it is to decode and discover the world around them . If you want to read a GOOD book about unschooling without unsupported platitudes and preaching in almost every chapter , I would recommend "" Homeschooling our Children , Unschooling Ourselves "" . Those authors offer more balance and eloquence than Ms. Fitzenreiter .",277,0,0.00042553191489365133,0.1473275160700177,0.00042553191489365133,0.00042553191489365133,0.00042553191489365133,0.00042553191489365133,0.00042553191489365133,0.10289116874629536,0.00042553191489365133,0.00042553191489365133,0.00042553191489365133,0.00042553191489365133,0.00042553191489365133,0.00042553191489365133,0.00042553191489365133,0.00042553191489365133,0.00042553191489365133,0.047731926848881306,0.00042553191489365133,0.00042553191489365133,0.00042553191489365133,0.00042553191489365133,0.00042553191489365133,0.00042553191489365133,0.00042553191489365133,0.00042553191489365133,0.00042553191489365133,0.00042553191489365133,0.00042553191489365133,0.024805793716983836,0.00042553191489365133,0.00042553191489365133,0.00042553191489365133,0.00042553191489365133,0.06894679169240572,0.00042553191489365133,0.26615316044564225,0.00042553191489365133,0.056027385017794126,0.09894392052843375,0.00042553191489365133,0.16972552842290622,0.00042553191489365133,0.00042553191489365133,0.00042553191489365133,0.00042553191489365133,0.00042553191489365133,0.00042553191489365133,0.00042553191489365133,0.00042553191489365133,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

And forget about anything good mentioned about the John Birch Society . Page 138 : "" Most Americans ignored the hooded Klansmen , the John Birchers , and other extremists ... "" never mind the fact that JBS is not and never was a racist or an extremist organization . But here is their name , sandwiched between the KKK and "" extremist . ""It is a typical tactic of the left to associate the opposition with the "" stench of racism "" as Stalin may have put it ( I do n't remember his exact quote ) . But you might ask , what about on page 89 where he refers glowingly to William F. Buckley as "" the cornerstone of the anti - communist wing of conservatism ... ? "" Keep in mind that this is the same Buckley who years later , in Lingua Franca magazine , confessed that he would be a "" Mike Harrington Socialist "" or a "" Communist "" if he were college brat today . Now on the other hand , try to find anywhere in this book , the words "" murderer , "" or even "" extremist "" in front of names like Mao Tse Tung , or Che Guevara or Tom Hayden , to name a few . There is a good reason for that , but I will leave it to your imagination , the reason why . In summary , should you decide to read this book , take it with a grain of salt , or better yet some motion - sickness pills because unless you are prone to the same convictions as our professor Lytle is , you 're going to need a barf - bag",521,0,0.2941022083579194,0.000338983050847492,0.000338983050847492,0.000338983050847492,0.000338983050847492,0.000338983050847492,0.000338983050847492,0.10008841546378727,0.000338983050847492,0.000338983050847492,0.000338983050847492,0.000338983050847492,0.000338983050847492,0.000338983050847492,0.000338983050847492,0.000338983050847492,0.07785191220271291,0.000338983050847492,0.000338983050847492,0.000338983050847492,0.000338983050847492,0.000338983050847492,0.000338983050847492,0.000338983050847492,0.000338983050847492,0.000338983050847492,0.02075473942423242,0.000338983050847492,0.000338983050847492,0.000338983050847492,0.000338983050847492,0.05070323310452241,0.033584641761877254,0.000338983050847492,0.000338983050847492,0.000338983050847492,0.36923846814541716,0.000338983050847492,0.000338983050847492,0.000338983050847492,0.03943909340393646,0.000338983050847492,0.000338983050847492,0.000338983050847492,0.000338983050847492,0.000338983050847492,0.000338983050847492,0.000338983050847492,0.000338983050847492,0.000338983050847492,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

50828,1,"Pot Noodle Bushido This novel of a 17th century samurai 's odyssey to Europe starts as a very straightforward story and rather continues that way , but towards the end , Endo does get in a few good points . The style is somewhat pedantic and staid , but easy to read . It 's certainly not a zen classic and the story never really gets off the ground or totally convinces . The historical backdrops are paper thin and obvious cut - and - pastes from history textbooks . I must admit I am somewhat baffled by all the rave reviews here . I can only conclude that a lot of people who do n't really have much experience of Japan , think they 've stumbled upon some sort of motherlode of bushido spirit in this conveniantly Westernized piece of writing by a Japanesese Christian . Remember , not every Japanese woman is a geisha , and not every Japanese writer can wield his pen like a samurai 's sword",171,0,0.1502637593659709,0.0006250000000000524,0.0006250000000000524,0.0006250000000000524,0.0006250000000000524,0.0006250000000000524,0.0006250000000000524,0.0006250000000000524,0.0006250000000000524,0.0006250000000000524,0.0006250000000000524,0.0006250000000000524,0.0006250000000000524,0.0006250000000000524,0.0314199383527767,0.0006250000000000524,0.08890137787489479,0.0006250000000000524,0.0006250000000000524,0.0006250000000000524,0.0006250000000000524,0.0006250000000774228,0.0006250000000000524,0.0006250000000000524,0.0006250000000000524,0.0006250000000000524,0.03237729771743229,0.0006250000000000524,0.0006250000000000524,0.0006250000000000524,0.0006250000000000524,0.030277071813717266,0.0006250000000000524,0.0006250000000000524,0.0006250000000000524,0.03725847099792563,0.3495873029594841,0.0006250000000000524,0.0006250000000000524,0.0006250000000000524,0.0006250000000000524,0.0006250000000000524,0.0006250000000000524,0.0006250000000000524,0.2536647809177188,0.0006250000000000524,0.0006250000000000524,0.0006250000000000524,0.0006250000000000524,0.0006250000000000524,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

As soon as I met the character who would turn out to be the driver , I knew the rest of the story . It was extremely easy to figure out and quite disappointing . The story 's decent .

50840,1,"Mixed feelings I 've used the lonely planet guides on other trips before , and have always been very pleased , but this one left me with a different taste in my mouth . LP was the only guide we purchased , based on our previous experiences with them , but we had the chance to peruse others in the B B 's we stayed in throughout our trip . Of all of them , I 'd rate the LP as the 2nd best for our interests - as they say , individual experiences may vary ! Ireland has become a very expen$ive tourist destination , so upon reflection , we would have been happier with the Rough Guide . LP has just tried to hard to cover all levels of expense in one guide , and has ended up short - changing all of them in the process . I hate to say it , but I 'd rather see them do one thing well than 3 things mediocre at best . I 'd still put it above most of the other guidebooks though . Our first and foremost gripe is how out of date the price estimates on everything are . I realize it was published two years ago , but we gradually learned to depend on everything costing about 20 % more than LP listed . That 's quite a jump for 2 years , indicating to me either poor fact - checking for the 2003 edition , or some pretty crazy inflation and a need for another update . Our second gripe was the local maps . They failed to provide maps for a lot of the smaller cities , and only provided maps of the city - center areas in the larger ones . Given the rarity of Irish street signage , those maps would have been a God - send for navigation in towns . Also , and this may be a function of the 2003 printing , a lot of the towns in Ireland are instituting one - way patterns in their city - centers , and LP 's maps rarely identified this . A third , again related gripe is with the existance , or lack thereof , of the various restaurants , b b 's , shops , etc . listed in the guide . Probably 30 % of the restaurants in the guide just are n't there any more . I realize they must have been when it went to print , but that did n't help us any . Our last gripe is the rather uneven coverage of large areas of the country . Granted , it reflected perfectly the tourist patterns - heavy coverage of larger cities and popular tourist areas along the coasts , pretty awful coverage of less touristed interior areas . Unfortunately , we did n't just want to go where all the other tourists go , so this left our noses still further out of joint . Overall , I 'd say if you want a guide that covers the sightes well , both LP and Rough Guide do that . If you want to keep the expenditures down , Rough Guide does it much better . If you want to go all out , um , there 's probably a third option , but neither of these two will do it well . If you want to be thrifty in some areas and splurge in others , then this guide is the closest you 'll get to filling your schizophrenic needs in one place - although , in that case , I 'd really recommend getting two guides , one for each end of the spectrum . One last piece of advice - buy a heritage card when you get to your first castle / tomb / historic place ! If you plan on visiting more than one or two historic places , its 20e cost will be recouped within days with all the free admissions it will get you for the rest of the trip",683,0,0.0002631578947368667,0.10531298988104977,0.021789408279336713,0.0002631578947368667,0.0002631578947368667,0.0002631578947368667,0.0002631578947368667,0.01323170895200119,0.0002631578947368667,0.0002631578947368667,0.07618585914932956,0.0002631578947368667,0.2066422235908781,0.0002631578947368667,0.010206065263084076,0.0002631578947368667,0.0002631578947368667,0.02222167873876914,0.02654027453193974,0.0002631578947368667,0.0002631578947368667,0.0002631578947368667,0.0002631578947368667,0.0002631578947368667,0.014681921548503611,0.0002631578947368667,0.0002631578947368667,0.0002631578947368667,0.0002631578947368667,0.0002631578947368667,0.0002631578947368667,0.0002631578947368667,0.08953415091435468,0.0002631578947368667,0.0002631578947368667,0.0002631578947368667,0.0002631578947368667,0.0002631578947368667,0.0002631578947368667,0.0002631578947368667,0.1097076722891578,0.0002631578947368667,0.0002631578947368667,0.0002631578947368667,0.2310838976770999,0.0405920533364383,0.022796411637530482,0.0002631578947368667,0.0002631578947368667,0.0002631578947368667,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0

50878,1,"formulaic and unsatisfying I have enjoyed the Miss Julia books tremendously but this is my least favorite . Miss Julia is married to Sam Murdoch . Poor guy is sent to find the missing Hazel Marie in one part and is gone for a good deal of the story . Miss Julia does not even make a case of those missing hours ! It is as if the author could really care less . There are so many little plots that you feel as if the author had several ideas and just took one and expanded it but left the others to show all the complications in this woman 's life . There are times when Miss Julia seems to self - centered and the tongue in cheek mood of the other books in this series is really not present here . I found her less likable and also less believable . She has taken in her husband 's mistress ad illegitimate child . Now , there is a question about the child 's paternity and she is tolerating the whole thing!!!!!Perhaps other books in the series would be a better intro for the uninitiated",195,0,0.0005405405405405837,0.0005405405405405837,0.030585064953863934,0.031494978302348986,0.045356598208464625,0.0276656874126064,0.0005405405405405837,0.07731084163882486,0.0005405405405405837,0.0005405405405405837,0.0005405405405405837,0.0005405405405405837,0.09371451443634513,0.0005405405405405837,0.0005405405405405837,0.0005405405405405837,0.09792325732108767,0.0005405405405405837,0.0005405405405405837,0.0005405405405405837,0.0005405405405405837,0.0005405405405405837,0.0005405405405405837,0.10424295404438741,0.0005405405405405837,0.0005405405405405837,0.0005405405405405837,0.0005405405405405837,0.0005405405405405837,0.0005405405405405837,0.0005405405405405837,0.0005405405405405837,0.0005405405405405837,0.0005405405405405837,0.0005405405405405837,0.027845585868563078,0.36142627417942746,0.0005405405405405837,0.0005405405405405837,0.0005405405405405837,0.0005405405405405837,0.0813531625529974,0.0005405405405405837,0.0005405405405405837,0.0005405405405405837,0.0005405405405405837,0.0005405405405405837,0.0005405405405405837,0.0005405405405405837,0.0005405405405405837,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

50921,1,"Disappointing , Slow , Clumsy South by Java Head features fundamentals I find so promising : a nautical adventure set in Southeast Asia during World War II , written by a prominent screenwriter . Nonetheless , the story falls flat and I found it just barely compelling enough to finish ; the plot moves slowly , punctuated by one clumsily executed plot twist after another , the descriptions of action are confusing , and the characters mere outlines devoid of development . I hoped this book would be as good as a 1950 's nautical adventure i highly recommend , The Wreck of the Mary Deare , but unfortunately Java Head is just disappointment .

In some cases , warnings are included regarding various drugs that are not based on scientific reports , but rather , are based on the marketing literature and information from the pharmaceutical companies themselves -- hardly an unbiased , consumer - oriented source of information . Consider as one example the book 's "" Do Not Use "" warning regarding the prescription drug , Armour Thyroid . Rather than offering any research to support this severe recommendation ( because there ISN'T any research ) , the "" guide "" instead quotes the AMA and the American Thyroid Association , two groups that greatly enjoy the largesse of the thyroid drug makers who want to put Armour -- a far less expensive drug -- out of business . If this is the sort of "" unbiased information "" you want about the drugs you take , you might as well go ahead and just read the pharmaceutical company pamphlets . If millions of thyroid patients taking Armour Thyroid were to follow the advice in "" Worst Pills , "" the only thing that ends up for the worse is our health .

50977,1,"A poor effort .... I read this as a thirteen year old boy and enjoyed it . A re - read twenty years later gave me a different perspective . MacLeans dialogue between his characters is comic book variety at best . There are also a few glaring errors that I am surprised that his editor did not pick up on , two of note : Shaffer ( supposedly from Montana ) is credited with a Mid - West accent ? ? Montana is far west not ' mid ' west . Secondly , Nazi helicopters ? This is just plain sloppy . MacLean should have known much better . This one belongs on the bookshelf of a teenage boy .

50980,1,"Why continue to be deceived ? Hank Hanegraff is a blatant replacement theologian where the nation of Israel is concerned . He is further from the truth where prophecy is concerned than most groups , to include pretribulationists . Indeed , his "" scholarship "" is no scholarship at all ; it is pure propaganda .... To see real scholarship , get Tim Cohen 's materials ( see below):Tim LaHaye , Jerry Jenkins , and others in the Pre - Trib circle , such as Ed Hindson , Tommy Ice , Chuck Missler , Zola Levitt , Thomas McCall , John Hagee , Grant Jeffrey , Marlin Maddox , Perry Stone , Texe Marrs , John Walvoord ( deceased ) , etc . , continue to put forth the same deceptions that Hal Lindsey popularized decades ago . The notion of a pre - tribulation rapture is foreign to scripture , it is foreign to the teachings of the early Church , and it is grooming the Church for destruction through ignorance and lack of preparation for what is really coming . These men are novices and not prophecy "" experts "" or "" scholars "" by any stretch of the imagination ; they are those who tickle the ears of gullible Christians . Why continue to be deceived ? Tim Cohen , in his excellent book , "" The AntiChrist and a Cup of Tea , "" provides biblically sound and testable evidence to show that the coming AntiChrist is known NOW . Not only that , the same author ( Tim Cohen ) has now put out the strongest presentation on the whole issue of the rapture EVER offered to the saints of God in Christ : "" The REAL Rapture "" .

50984,1,"There 's really no age group for this book I hold Martin 's Song of Ice and Frie series in high regard ; the man is a talented writer . For adults .

At least his novels have sense of humor , suspense , very interesting characters and most important , they are very well written",118,0,0.0007142857142857792,0.0007142857142857792,0.0007142857142857792,0.0007142857142857792,0.0007142857142857792,0.0007142857142857792,0.0007142857142857792,0.0007142857142857792,0.0007142857142857792,0.0007142857142857792,0.0007142857142857792,0.0007142857142857792,0.23797019315094894,0.0007142857142857792,0.0007142857142857792,0.0007142857142857792,0.0007142857142857792,0.0007142857142857792,0.0007142857142857792,0.0007142857142857792,0.06920539390066555,0.0007142857142857792,0.0007142857142857792,0.0007142857142857792,0.0007142857142857792,0.03716846920904381,0.0007142857142857792,0.0007142857142857792,0.0007142857142857792,0.0007142857142857792,0.0007142857142857792,0.0007142857142857792,0.0007142857142857792,0.0007142857142857792,0.0007142857142857792,0.0007142857142857792,0.6227988008821959,0.0007142857142857792,0.0007142857142857792,0.0007142857142857792,0.0007142857142857792,0.0007142857142857792,0.0007142857142857792,0.0007142857142857792,0.0007142857142857792,0.0007142857142857792,0.0007142857142857792,0.0007142857142857792,0.0007142857142857792,0.0007142857142857792,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
51011,1,"A great find during an annual summer shopping trip I found this novel at a bookstore on the boardwalk I visit at least once every summer . I love going there and looking to see if I can find a book that I have never heard of , by an author I 've never heard of , and buy it on a whim . This is the novel I bought last year . I has , unfortunately , sat on my shelf since then until tonight , because of many reasons . Tonight , however , I picked it up and read it cover to cover . The narrative was brilliantly told , the dialogue completely believable and the plot totally heartwrenching . If I had made it to the end without some tears , I would believe myself made of stone ! Skip is a character many can relate to : a man unsatisfied with how his life has turned out , down about how his friends have really not been friends at all , that gets the chance to do something great by this little child . However , it is the change she makes in those around her which are truly the BLESSINGS of the title . Faith , a name not used lightly , restores her namesake in all those touched by her . She ultimately gives him the chance of making something of his life without even knowing it . Many BLESSINGS occur in this wonderful novel , and I found myself all at once sour about how humankind can be at times , but also proud at how humankind can be at others ( which is a fact , in itself , that proves how well Quindlen has spun her tale ) . The fact is that just because a person has been to jail , has deadbeat friends , does not mean he is of that same stock ; just because an elderly woman has become so dragged down by her own life does not mean she has no feeling left in her . Skip , Lydia , Nadine , Meredith , Jennifer ... all have many dimentions to their characters that Quindlen has spectacularly drawn",373,1,0.000317460317460353,0.000317460317460353,0.000317460317460353,0.000317460317460353,0.03449704563946004,0.000317460317460353,0.000317460317460353,0.1468351232497086,0.000317460317460353,0.000317460317460353,0.040533105743050094,0.02229669977885182,0.20747768744650052,0.000317460317460353,0.000317460317460353,0.000317460317460353,0.000317460317460353,0.03007962548919281,0.000317460317460353,0.000317460317460353,0.000317460317460353,0.000317460317460353,0.000317460317460353,0.000317460317460353,0.000317460317460353,0.02857278099181869,0.000317460317460353,0.000317460317460353,0.000317460317460353,0.000317460317460353,0.000317460317460353,0.000317460317460353,0.000317460317460353,0.000317460317460353,0.000317460317460353,0.000317460317460353,0.20630608285097163,0.000317460317460353,0.000317460317460353,0.000317460317460353,0.000317460317460353,0.014816873276409246,0.07255239676495734,0.15481953558186712,0.029149551123718635,0.000317460317460353,0.000317460317460353,0.000317460317460353,0.000317460317460353,0.000317460317460353,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0

51019,1,"One of Koontz 's better books Fear nothing is about Christopher Snow , whose parents die in supposedly innocent ways , but Chris soon finds out that what is seems is not really what it is , and even that his little town of Moonlight Bay is stranger , and scarier , than he thought . Chris then sets out with his friends , and his dog , to find out the truth about what 's really going on . Fear Nothing is a good plot written in typical Koontz style . Fear nothing grabs you from the beginning and holds you all the way through . It keeps you guessing and just when you think you have it figured out , it throws something new at you and makes you guess some more . Koontz creates some very likable characters and by the end of the story , you like them , and feel as if you know them . Fear Nothing is very descriptive , Koontz describes his locations so well you feel like you 're in them , and experiencing the plot right next to the main character . I have not read the sequel , but I am anxious to do so .",207,1,0.0005714285714286134,0.10505433859786417,0.0005714285714286134,0.0005714285714286134,0.0005714285714286134,0.0005714285714286134,0.0005714285714286134,0.0005714285714286134,0.0005714285714286134,0.0005714285714286134,0.0005714285714286134,0.0005714285714286134,0.0005714285714286134,0.0005714285714286134,0.0005714285714286134,0.0005714285714286134,0.0005714285714286134,0.0005714285714286134,0.0005714285714286134,0.0005714285714286134,0.0005714285714286134,0.258539275598808,0.0005714285714286134,0.0005714285714286134,0.0005714285714286134,0.0005714285714286134,0.0005714285714286134,0.0005714285714286134,0.0005714285714286134,0.0005714285714286134,0.0005714285714286134,0.0005714285714286134,0.0005714285714286134,0.0005714285714286134,0.0005714285714286134,0.0005714285714286134,0.42531528553612635,0.0005714285714286134,0.0005714285714286134,0.0005714285714286134,0.0005714285714286134,0.0005714285714286134,0.027490591652408716,0.0005714285714286134,0.15788622290050502,0.0005714285714286134,0.0005714285714286134,0.0005714285714286134,0.0005714285714286134,0.0005714285714286134,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

51036,1,"If you have hormonal imbalances , this is a great resource ... OMG ! ! ! I could not put this book down ... I am in my upper twenties and I am going thru a bunch of these symptoms already . Yes the book is bios about natural progesterone , so what ... I have not personally used progesterone cream yet , because I am waiting for my saliva test results to make sure that 's what I need . But even if I do n't , everything else provided in the book is amazing information . Your diet , your vitamins , your stress level , your physical activity , everything is co - related to most woman 's hormonal imbalances . They even talked about a case where a woman did not want to use the natural progesterone and how by changing all of the other stuff in her life , she achieved hormone balancing . If you are suffering from hormonal imbalances , I will strongly recommend this book . I also bought other ones that I will be reading after this one . But I started with "" Be Lean by Romy Seleznov "" , which is a story from her life and how she struggled to balance her hormones and gives all the details of what she did , then I continued with this book , and the next one I will be reading is "" Natural Hormone Balance for Women "" by Uzzi Reiss , which does cite this book as well . If you think you have a hormonal imbalance , please do not rely on your doctor 100 % , I am not saying that you should not believe them or rule out everything they say , but do your homework . I have been telling my doctors since I am in my TEENS that I feel I have an imbalance with my hormones and since all of the results come back fine they have been telling me that my symptoms were "" normal "" ... WRONG ! ! ! Now they found a tumor in my pituitary gland , which causes an imbalance ... The tumor grows slowly , so I am sure that it has been there for years , but they never checked it before . Now that I am treating it , all of my "" normal "" symptoms are almost gone . I am still on the process of getting everything in balance . If you feel you have something wrong , even if the results of your blood work comes as normal , READ more and look for healthy ways of changing your diet , exercising more , balance your hormones , and look for second opinions and definitely have a good naturopath that you can go to . Also "" Bikram Yoga "" , is an excellent exercise to helping you with hormonal balancing . At least that 's part of what I changed .",501,1,0.09724078175967532,0.00033898305084748513,0.00033898305084748513,0.00033898305084748513,0.00033898305084748513,0.00033898305084748513,0.02328488209400599,0.15223627040781096,0.00033898305084748513,0.00033898305084748513,0.00033898305084748513,0.00033898305084748513,0.00033898305084748513,0.00033898305084748513,0.00033898305084748513,0.00033898305084748513,0.00033898305084748513,0.043735960989998275,0.00033898305084748513,0.00033898305084748513,0.00033898305084748513,0.00033898305084748513,0.00033898305084748513,0.00033898305084748513,0.00033898305084748513,0.00033898305084748513,0.00033898305084748513,0.00033898305084748513,0.00033898305084748513,0.00033898305084748513,0.00033898305084748513,0.00033898305084748513,0.00033898305084748513,0.00033898305084748513,0.00033898305084748513,0.04806774434956872,0.28871201149003045,0.00033898305084748513,0.084986627918423,0.00033898305084748513,0.02839960901436904,0.00033898305084748513,0.00033898305084748513,0.00033898305084748513,0.18849472580274063,0.00033898305084748513,0.031282064139478157,0.00033898305084748513,0.00033898305084748513,0.00033898305084748513,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0

51047,1,"Wonderful "" Wizard of Oz "" I was a reasonably big fan of the "" Wizard of Oz "" when I was a kid . I 'd seen the Judy Garland film , the "" Return to Oz "" film , my parents had taken me to a theatre production , and there used to be a cartoon series about Dorothy and her friends that I quite liked . Here in Australia , though , you do n't see an awful lot of the Wizard of Oz books , and I missed out on all that as a kid . I managed to find a copy just recently of the the original story , and I really liked it . It 's really a shame I could n't find it earlier . Dorothy is a girl who lives with her aunt and her uncle in the countryside of Kansas . In the midst of a "" cyclone "" , Dorothy , her dog Toto , and her whole house are swept away to the Land of Oz , a beautiful but strange world full of all sorts of interesting creatures , good and bad witches , and a very famous wizard . Dorothy tries to find her way home , and on the way makes many new friends , like the Scarecrow , "" Tin Woodsman "" and the cowardly lion . Will she ever make it home?It 's rather different to the movie , I found . For one , the journey Dorothy and her friends go on takes many days , whereas the in the Judy Garland film it seems to all take place much shorter . The magic shoes Dorothy picks up in Oz are silver here , and not ruby red like in the film . There are also a lot of other creatures and things in the book , like the queen of the mice , the Hammerheads , and the Dainty China people . Though the world of Oz seems pretty big in the film , it feels a lot bigger to me in the book . Oz has a nice atmosphere too , I thought . It 's very cosy and familiar , and kind of evokes a kind of America the way that say C.S. Lewis and J.R.R. Tolkien evokes a kind of Britain , if that makes any sense . North , south , east , west ... in Oz 's every direction there 's a new land to explore . You never know who you might meet , or how they 'll do things there . I quite like how laid back everyone is in Oz . The way the Munchkins and the people of the Emerald City speak , for instance . I enjoyed finding out things about my favorite characters too , like how the Tinman became made of tin and how the flying monkeys became slave to the wicked witch of the west , which is all described here . That reminds me , there is a little bit of fairy tale violence here , but nothing worse than you might find in "" Little Red Riding Hood"" . All in all , a great read , I thought . Whimsical , colourful and fun . I do hope I can get my hands on some of the follow up books .

51059,1,"6 Stars and more really - wonderful cookbook and book This is wonderful ! It is for fans of Laura Ingalls Wilder , and also for those who are interested in historic cooking - from prairie and colonial days which have their basis in so many of the cultures which settled America in the early days , and adapted for use thereThis book is a very happy blend of the Laura Ingalls stories and the food which was eaten , interspersed with the recipes and how they would have been prepared and cooked . Of course Laura did n't include any of the actual recipes in her book and so they have gleaned from similar cookbooks and so on of the day . It has been adjusted to modern need for exact temperatures and measures . I found this book so lovely to read through , not just browse through . The interest factor is great - learning what things were available , and how they were used - baking soda , yeasts , how the oven was used , what cooking items they would have had access too as well as some of the stuff we should know but forget - seasonal food avaialble . But it is good as a simple recipe book . It is an incredible look at times gome pastone of my best reads in the last few years , I also bought a Prairie cookbook which I would highly recommend as well - it is more of a recipe book than this one , but a lovely complementary book to it",267,1,0.11782606446976247,0.09777871991327083,0.04547424126720358,0.0004255319148936514,0.020653571079998267,0.0004255319148936514,0.0004255319148936514,0.0004255319148936514,0.0004255319148936514,0.0004255319148936514,0.0004255319148936514,0.08690406583984428,0.0004255319148936514,0.0004255319148936514,0.0004255319148936514,0.0004255319148936514,0.0004255319148936514,0.03651470888049614,0.0004255319148936514,0.0004255319148936514,0.0004255319148936514,0.0004255319148936514,0.0004255319148936514,0.025234649804399427,0.02944084837582797,0.0004255319148936514,0.0004255319148936514,0.0004255319148936514,0.0004255319148936514,0.0004255319148936514,0.0004255319148936514,0.0004255319148936514,0.0004255319148936514,0.0004255319148936514,0.0004255319148936514,0.0004255319148936514,0.30809276106570477,0.0004255319148936514,0.0004255319148936514,0.0004255319148936514,0.088168101869311,0.0004255319148936514,0.0004255319148936514,0.0004255319148936514,0.07749636399511771,0.0004255319148936514,0.05024569067310491,0.0004255319148936514,0.0004255319148936514,0.0004255319148936514,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0
51062,1,"Excellent Idea , Severe Omission Blanchard and Hybels and Hodges team up for an excellent perspective on leadership from a Christian point of view . While reaching out to the secular marketplace with valid concepts for servant leadership , they put together an excellent framework for leadership . The summary checklist , given on pp . 171ff . , offer a helpful concise summary of the book . The glaring omission , and one that I ca n't believe that Hybels would make , is to clearly point out that following Jesus ' style of leadership is absolutely impossible apart from first having a personal relationship with Jesus , in other words , you ca n't lead like Jesus if you do n't have him in your life to help you . I ca n't believe that there was n't at least an appendix for those who would like to pursue that issue further . I believe that the authors are posturing too much to get the secular audience to read the book .

51064,1,"Are "" you "" in this book ? You , the reader , are the subject and the hero of Calvino 's novel , an exercise in reader - response theory gone mad . Calvino 's lively experiment begins by describing a reader ( that is , "" you "" ) reading Calvino 's novel and , after this opening , "" you "" settle in to read the novel that you were "" meant "" to be reading -- a noir mystery with a cliffhanger at the end of the first chapter . But all is not fair in the Land of Fiction ; the copy of the book has been misbound by the printer , so you have to rush to the store to get a properly printed book -- only to find that the replacement is a different book entirely . After several tricks and machinations , you end up reading the beginnings of ten different books , written in ten different styles , yet all sharing place and character names and even themes . ( Part of the fun is identifying the author being imitated : the most obvious segments mock Borges , Dostoevsky , and Chekhov . ) While initially it seems that Calvino assumes you are male , soon you are introduced to the Other Reader and "" you "" see the story through her eyes . Both of you work to solve the mystery of the erratic book passages , and the pleasure of reading is heightened by romantic tensions between the two of you . The book alternates between the story fragments and the story of "" you . "" The repeated changes and interruptions in style and story can be baffling : "" You ca n't get your bearings : the characters have changed , the settings , you do n't understand what it 's about , you find names of people and do n't know who they are . "" It 's a bit like "" Groundhog Day , "" except that instead of being stuck inside the same day , you 're doomed to repeat ten different but terrifyingly similar acts of literature interruptus . Well before the end of the novel , you realize that the real story is not to be found in any of the parodies ( mysteries , fantasies , and romances ) that you desperately try ( and fail ) to finish , but in the story of your reading experience itself -- an experience made all the more complicated by the web of conspiracies engendered by the Other Reader , a reclusive popular writer , a charlatan churning out counterfeit books under the writer 's name , a sloppy and conniving translator , and various officials of repressive dictatorships . For the reader who does n't mind when an author attempts to describe your state of mind , Calvino 's novel can be pure fun . The success of Calvino 's task depends in no small part on whether the reading experience he describes recalls how you read a book ; I know that some readers find some of these passages alien ( "" That 's not how I read books "" ) , but for me the various descriptions of the reading experience were both perceptive and eerily familiar . This reader , too , found the first half of the book far more engaging than the second half ; later in the book , the gimmick inevitably wears a little thin and the detours that spoof publishing conglomerates , repressive governments , and state censorship were a bit more than this short novel could handle . And the "" solution "" to the puzzle , although fitting , has the oomph of the finale to a shaggy - dog story . No matter -- if you enjoy metafiction , you might just recognize yourself in this clever book",657,1,0.09084766527796127,0.00020202020202021815,0.00020202020202021815,0.00020202020202021815,0.00020202020202021815,0.00020202020202021815,0.00020202020202021815,0.00020202020202021815,0.00020202020202021815,0.00020202020202021815,0.00020202020202021815,0.00020202020202021815,0.00020202020202021815,0.00020202020202021815,0.020404040403596935,0.00020202020202021815,0.016053767618944184,0.01194451018235895,0.00020202020202021815,0.00020202020202021815,0.00020202020202021815,0.00020202020202021815,0.00020202020202021815,0.00020202020202021815,0.02050988554155114,0.00020202020202021815,0.013000803334082434,0.00020202020202021815,0.00020202020202021815,0.00020202020202021815,0.00020202020202021815,0.00020202020202021815,0.008231598553280983,0.00020202020202021815,0.11020517245183718,0.00020202020202021815,0.7005197283535579,0.00020202020202021815,0.00020202020202021815,0.00020202020202021815,0.00020202020202021815,0.00020202020202021815,0.00020202020202021815,0.00020202020202021815,0.00020202020202021815,0.00020202020202021815,0.00020202020202021815,0.00020202020202021815,0.00020202020202021815,0.00020202020202021815,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

51080,1,"Pictures Are Worth A 1000 Words Charlie Bone is n't your typical nine - year - old boy . Although he did n't know that himself . But when photographs get mixed up and he ends up with a picture of a man and a little girl that talks to him , he knows everything that was normal about his life is gone forever . Tracking down the picture , Charlie finds out it belongs to Miss Ingledew , a woman who owns a bookshop and has been looking for her missing niece for years . She gives Charlie a mysterious package ( that he ca n't open ) and sets him on his journey that will change everything in his world . As it turns out , Charlie is one of the descendants of the Red King , a mysterious person who had wondrous magical powers who went into hiding . The Red King 's children have been equally divided between good and evil ever since . At Bloor 's Academy , Charlie finds friends and enemies , and the challenge of his lifetime as he tracks down secrets others do n't want revealed . Jenny Nimmo is the author of five books in the Charlie Bone series and has written several other children 's books and fantasies . Many people compare Charlie Bone to Harry Potter , and that 's a good comparison . But the two series are different . Harry 's family is really non - supportive , but Charlie has a loving mother , a doting grandmother , and Uncle Paton , who turns out to be something of a hero . The book is a fun , fast - paced whirlwind of mysteries , magic , and friendship . Even at 400 pages , it feels like it 's over much too soon . There are a few jarring instances where the point - of - view was disconnected , moving from one character and one scene into another without warning . They were easily overlooked due to the pacing of the story , but noticeable all the same . Fans who are waiting for the next Harry Potter book who have n't tried the Charlie Bone series are encouraged to do so . Charlie 's story , although similar , has much to offer in reading excitement",394,1,0.10276756994880734,0.0003174603174603541,0.0003174603174603541,0.0003174603174603541,0.0003174603174603541,0.0003174603174603541,0.0003174603174603541,0.09284486138815486,0.0003174603174603541,0.0003174603174603541,0.0003174603174603541,0.021888752752218507,0.06390713487326495,0.0003174603174603541,0.0003174603174603541,0.0003174603174603541,0.0003174603174603541,0.0003174603174603541,0.0003174603174603541,0.0003174603174603541,0.0003174603174603541,0.0003174603174603541,0.0003174603174603541,0.11698710208695758,0.042596694111002566,0.0003174603174603541,0.0003174603174603541,0.0003174603174603541,0.0003174603174603541,0.03977387457096018,0.0003174603174603541,0.0003174603174603541,0.0003174603174603541,0.0003174603174603541,0.17459762466423295,0.01682795313963737,0.23367486292455075,0.0003174603174603541,0.0003174603174603541,0.0003174603174603541,0.019190485804400227,0.0003174603174603541,0.03316569637767491,0.030031355612104748,0.0003174603174603541,0.0003174603174603541,0.0003174603174603541,0.0003174603174603541,0.0003174603174603541,0.0003174603174603541,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

51106,1,"Absitively a Great Read You know that guy down the street who acts awful snake - like ? What about the cashier at Walmart who is catty ? And there are always people in our lives that could easily be one of many species of monkeys . Neil Gaiman shows through fiction that there may be more to these strange characters in our lives than we realize . In this novel , gods ( which represent animals ) roam the earth in the bodies of humans . The main character is the clever , trouble - loving spider who interacts with other animal - gods in everyday human life . This book , along with other science fiction books , has given me an appreciation of the creativity of the human imagination . The strong point of this novel is the humor employed by Neil Gaiman . On par with Douglas Adams , the author of Anasi Boys fills the pages with quirky , pop - culture laden humor . The main character , Fat Charlie , I found much in common with . His awkward moments with friends , family and everyone else reveal a social insecurity that many are familiar with . The story , however , is n't anything special . I like witches and animal - gods as much as the next guy , but the plot is uninteresting . It is a rare book that combines wit with plot , and this is not one of those rare books .",255,1,0.0004761904761905156,0.0004761904761905156,0.0004761904761905156,0.0004761904761905156,0.038979510911484085,0.0004761904761905156,0.024285714392404054,0.17102472476101716,0.0004761904761905156,0.0004761904761905156,0.0004761904761905156,0.0004761904761905156,0.0004761904761905156,0.0004761904761905156,0.0004761904761905156,0.0004761904761905156,0.0004761904761905156,0.0004761904761905156,0.0004761904761905156,0.0004761904761905156,0.30831835196387986,0.0004761904761905156,0.0004761904761905156,0.0004761904761905156,0.0004761904761905156,0.0004761904761905156,0.0004761904761905156,0.0004761904761905156,0.0004761904761905156,0.0004761904761905156,0.0004761904761905156,0.0004761904761905156,0.0004761904761905156,0.0004761904761905156,0.102547582813536,0.0004761904761905156,0.333891734205296,0.0004761904761905156,0.0004761904761905156,0.0004761904761905156,0.0004761904761905156,0.0004761904761905156,0.0004761904761905156,0.0004761904761905156,0.0004761904761905156,0.0004761904761905156,0.0004761904761905156,0.0004761904761905156,0.0004761904761905156,0.0004761904761905156,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
51108,1,"nifty development environment The use of an Integrated Development Environment [ IDE ] for a user to learn a language in , and to then program within , is well known . Microsoft has made powerful IDEs for its languages . And the open source Eclipse can be used for Java . Along these lines , Ducasse offers his book . It teaches Smalltalk using the Squeak IDE . The twist is that Squeak uses the visual metaphors of robots and robot factory , to convey the crucial concepts of objects / classes . As Ducasse explains , Squeak can be directed at an audience that is perhaps of high school age or even younger . So a clear visual feedback between example code and what the student sees then happen is vital , given her limited background and possibly limited attention span . Squeak uses Smalltalk in part because that is a very minimalist language . If you come from C++ , Java or C # , you may be struck by its simplicity , compared to the oodles of classes and notational intricacies of those languages . Which of course also makes it easier for a young student to learn Smalltalk or Squeak itself . I wonder a little about the book itself , though . A motivated high school student could easily use it . But for some younger students ?

51145,1,"Flawed but Enjoyable Yes , it 's cliche . Yes , the plot is lifted directly from Star Wars . Yes , there are obvious references to Anne McCaffrey , Tolkien and other fantasy writers . But who cares?Eragon is , above all else , an enjoyable read . Despite underlying flaws in the writing , Paolini effectively tells a rewarding good - versus - evil story in a clearly - defined world , with a well - thought - out magic system and a realism Tolkien could never muster . Sure , Eragon has its critics ( mostly aspiring writers that have not enjoyed Paolini 's success ) , but if you can ignore their blustering and simply take the book at face value , I think you 'll be pleasantly surprised . Although not as epic or impressive as some of the older fantasy works , Eragon is nonetheless , a great read",155,1,0.1787231965096673,0.0007692307692308563,0.0007692307692308563,0.0007692307692308563,0.0829020562600242,0.0007692307692308563,0.0007692307692308563,0.0007692307692308563,0.0007692307692308563,0.0007692307692308563,0.0007692307692308563,0.0007692307692308563,0.0007692307692308563,0.0007692307692308563,0.0007692307692308563,0.0007692307692308563,0.0007692307692308563,0.0007692307692308563,0.0007692307692308563,0.0007692307692308563,0.0007692307692308563,0.2355059106101892,0.0007692307692308563,0.0007692307692308563,0.0007692307692308563,0.0007692307692308563,0.0007692307692308563,0.0007692307692308563,0.0007692307692308563,0.0007692307692308563,0.0007692307692308563,0.0007692307692308563,0.0007692307692308563,0.0007692307692308563,0.17794696950557856,0.0007692307692308563,0.29030648249915225,0.0007692307692308563,0.0007692307692308563,0.0007692307692308563,0.0007692307692308563,0.0007692307692308563,0.0007692307692308563,0.0007692307692308563,0.0007692307692308563,0.0007692307692308563,0.0007692307692308563,0.0007692307692308563,0.0007692307692308563,0.0007692307692308563,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

51148,1,"Freedom , Freedom , Freedom ! Give up dieting forever ! I have and I am now losing weight eating anything , yes anything , I want . Can you imagine eating anything you want and not being frightened ? This is the book that will set you free , this is the book you need . Has it struck you that dieting is unnatural ? Do n't eat this , do n't eat that , count this , count that , measure this , measure that , I ca n't have this , and I ca n't have that , ad nauseum . Which diet guru are you going to believe ? Can you reall stay with a low - carb diet or a high - carb diet or calorie counting the rest of your life ? Most importantly , do you want to stick to a restricted diet the rest of your life ? The first day of my new eating pattern I ate two meals . The second day , I woke up with no hunger , no reactive hypoglycemia ( nausea and shakes from hunger ) ! What a miracle . I have shifted to an apple for lunch and anything I want for dinner ( I love to cook and desire to eat with my family ) . At maintenance , I may end up eating two meals a day ; I do n't know and it certainly is n't something to quot;worry quot ; about . The diet gurus that say one meal will cause you to overeat later , etc . , are wrong , wrong , wrong . Maybe it sounds theoretically correct , but it does not work that way . Listen , I have found out the less you eat , the less you eat . I do eat to satisfaction at dinner and it does not stretch my stomach . By the way , Dr. Dean Edell stated on his radio show that he only eats one meal a day himself . He says there is NO scientific proof that X number of meals are better than one . Also , I want you dear readers to know that I have four friends who are quot;naturally quot ; slim ( adult women - 30 's and 40 's ) . Two of them eat a small amount for lunch ( like a small hamburger ) and a good dinner ( they are sizes 3 and 6 ) . One gal eats at 2:30 PM , a huge amount , and a snack at night ( she is size 7 ) . One gal does nibble all day , like a potato chip here and there ( no thank you , personally ) . Oh , and a relative who is size 4 eats breakfast and dinner , never lunch . Remember my comeback for sabotagers : quot;Slim people do n't need much food , even if we exercise . Who says a certain number of meals a day are better than one or two ? quot ; The only negative thing I have to say about Diane 's book is that I felt she took scripture out of context . God fed the Israelites manna 2X a day ; they were supernaturally filled and nourished . He does not feed anyone manna today . Also , biblical gluttony is not overeating ( I do believe a lifestyle of overeating is sin , but not gluttony ) . Biblical gluttony refers to the Roman - type parties where people overate , overdrank and went on to commit more sin . On the positive side , I do believe Diane tries steer away from legalism and authoritarianism . This book is an answer to prayer .

The sauces for Halibut with Spicy Asian Vinaigrette ( really a sambal vinaigrette ) and Wasabi Cream were awesome . Veggie dishes like Asparagus with Shallot and sesame seeds add a special touch to everyday dinners . Granted , I have n't even put a dent in the vast amount of dishes represented in this massive cookbook - but so far so good !

51173,1,"The Truth hurts . ( W is not really number one.)Ritter 's book is best summed up by Ritter in these 4 paragraphs from the Epilogue;""The notion of the war in Iraq resulting from an intelligence failure is very convenient for all parties involved . The intelligence community can simply say that intelligence is a tricky business , and sometimes you get it wrong . This , of course , provides a convenient excuse for the politicians , and compliant media , to contend that they were simply acting in the public interest based upon the information they were given ...... In the end , to accept the concept of Iraq as an intelligence failure , one must first accept the premise that the USA was implementing , as its primary objective for Iraq , the Security Council 's resolutions on disarmament . This argument is simpy not sustainable . The behavior of the United States government and its intelligence agencies during my time as an inspector was not that of a government that was serious about disarmament . Support for UNSCOM 's mission was , at best , tailored to the political imperatives at any given time . There was a total willingness to compromise the integrity of UNSCOM ( and with it the whole notion of multilateral disarmament ) for short - term tactical advantages in the battle between the US and Iraqi regimes . Towards the end of the inspections era , elements of the US government actively sought to make UNSCOM 's job more difficult by cutting it off from intelligence sources . Disarmament was simply not the USA 's principal policy objective in Iraq after 1991 . Regime change was . The CIA was designated as the principal implementer of this policy . Therefore , when one looks at the March , 2003 invasion of Iraq and the subsequent removal of power of the government of Saddam Hussein , the only conclusion that can be reached is that the CIA accomplished its mission . Iraq was , in fact , a great intelligence victory , insofar as the CIA , through its manipulation of the work of the UN weapons inspectors and the distortion of fact about Iraq 's WMD programs , maintained the public perception of an armed and defiant Iraq in the face of plausible and plentiful evidence to the contrary . We now know that both the US and UK intelligence services had , by July 2002 , agreed to ' fix the intelligence around policy ' . But the fact remains that , at least as far as the CIA is concerned , the issue of ' fixing intelligence around policy ' predates July 2002 , reaching as far back as 1992 when the decision was made to doctor the intelligence about Iraqi SCUD missile accounting , asserting the existence of missiles in the face of UNSCOM inspection results which demonstrated that there were none . As an American , I find it very disturbing that the intelligence services of my country would resort to lies and deceit when addressing an issue of such fundamental importance to the security of the USA . Intelligence , to me , has always been about the facts . When intelligence is skewed to fit policy , then the entire system of trust that is fundamental in a free and democratic society is put at risk . Iraq , and the role of the CIA in selling the war with Iraq , is a manifestation of such a breach of trust . ""We've been had . On the Grand Scale .

51179,1,"The Law was not about truth . It was about negotiation , amelioration and manipulation . Michael Haller 's life revolves around criminal defense , his an attorney operating out the back of his Lincoln town car . His appearance sharply dressed and charmed mannerism makes him a very approachable guy , people either called him Mick or Mickey . Tall , dark and Intelligent with his good looks and Irish blood lines made him a catch . In the court room he was very together with great timing , in his personal life it was a mess , at last count he had two ex wives and one daughter . His father long deceased was also a famous defense attorney ; another pressure of expectation in life he felt he had to live up to , his father wrote books and practised law that did n't have room for innocent clients , so far Mickey had spent most of his life worrying that he just would n't recognize innocence if it came along . Being an Independent operator he ran his business with his own private detective on his bankroll , he was also chauffeured around by an ex client who could n't afford to pay his fees . In total he kept four Lincolns for another enterprise on the horizon encase things turned sour , what he was really looking for was a franchise player , a case to keep the cash rolling , point blank a meal ticket . Louis Ross Roulet dealt in LA property he was a rich playboy , currently booked on charges of ag - assault , GBI , and attempted rape , and although his arrest charges looked bad these could always be dropped to something less by the time he made court . Mickey could n't believe his luck not only a rich client but looking at the evidence it was stacked in favour to get him off the hook . This was all too easy , in fact with sharp tactics of negotiation and manipulation it was an open and shut case . Just as he was on a roll Mickey 's close friend is murdered he begins to have second thoughts about his case something just did n't sit right , in his search for innocence had he instead stumbled upon something more sinister or maybe something just plain evil . This is the first time in a long time that I have picked up a book based on a court room drama ; but this book is much more than just that . Michael Connelly has done a wonderful job ; his close collaboration with real life defense attorneys has paid off with their knowledge shining through ; well written and easy to follow so you do n't get lost in the jargon of law , especially for someone like me who is not familiar with the US law system . I 'm hoping very much that Mr. Connelly will be able to entwine the exciting lawyer Mickey Haller in other books going forward , Congratulations to Michael Connelly for a rollercoaster read .

51183,1,"Well - written book For those that are avid readers of journalistic works such as this one , you would absolutely enjoy every moment rummaging through the pages . Statistics are provided but never to the point of being too dry and too boring for the readers to read through . The writer endeavours to shed lights for us ramifications of China and its muscle power . Instead of branding China as a villain , we need to understand that without support from purchasers who are looking for the cheapest bargains , China would n't be where it is now . Wal - Mart is covered in detail . The writer gives us a projection that if car manufacturing industry is heading the same direction of products manufacturing , it 's only a matter of time before prices for cars would plummet quite considerably in the future when China has perfected its manufacturing bases just as Japan and South Korea had done before it . Then , there 's another discussion about the shifting of population from countryside into urban centres where manufacturing bases are located , and how China is able to sustain the supply of cheap labour . China 's progress is n't simply detrimental to other countries . On contrary , it benefits them as well . For example , Australia is having a boom right now due to exportation of natural resources to China . With increase of living standard in China , Chinese needs more nutritious food . As China could n't provide enough , United States particularly the Middle States are enjoying a boom in supplying food to the Middle Kingdom . Then , there are also discussions about other foreign powers keeping United States in check by siding with China , and also the love and hate relationship between USA and China of controlling the currencies so as to keep the interest rates at an attractive rate to facilitate growth in China and so forth . Whilst nobody knows for certain the exact figures of information provided ( since China has this tendency to manipulate figures since the beginning of time ) , suffice to say that the book explains how the mechanism works and allowing us to have an insight of how international trade ticks . Yes , some reviewers are fastidious and highly critical of figures provided by the writer but ultimately , I think they are missing the points . What 's crucial from this book is that we need to understand better about China and learning how to work alongside it in order to share the gains it would garner over the years to come .

51193,1,"Keen marketing sense Reviewed by Bette Daoust , Ph.D. for Reader Views ( 6/06)I find it interesting that I am reviewing a book I had read five years ago when it first came out . All this really means is that this book has definite longevity ( and believe it or not , all of the "" predictions "" in the book are a reality today . Seth Godin set forth to spread his book like a virus to everyone he could through his connections , and their connections , and their connections and "" so on and so on "" . The truth is the idea virus is real and his book is living proof that ideas and other products can certainly be spread by word - of-(mouth , email , infrared , download , or whatever).I have always been an admirer of Seth Godin and although I have not read all of his books , I will make certain that I do . He has a keen sense of marketing like no other as in his "" Purple Cow "" as well as this book "" Unleashing the Idea Virus "" . Who better to write about spreading ideas around than Seth . His book has certainly hit the circuit and still has a long way to go before absolutely everyone who should read this book ( and apply the information ) . This book is a must for anyone that touches the marketing function in their business . The Idea Virus is a book full of common sense items but with a twist that makes them more realistic than just theory . The real life situations described bring all the points to home .

51217,1,"The Skinny on Hiassin Were someone to write a biography of Carl Hiassin in fifty years it is hard to imagine that he or she would n't focus on the author 's latest triumph , Skinny Dip . It is one of his seminal achievements . The book simply shines with humor , well drawn characters , action and as usual everyone gets their just desserts . It is also one of his smoothest rides . One gets the feeling that Hiassin was very confident in every sentence that he wrote . Here is an overview that will stimulate readers ' interest Hiassin 's . The book opens with Chaz trying to kill his wife by flinging her over the rail of their cruise ship , but by some twists and turns and luck Joey survives long enough to be rescued . Much of the rest of the book circles around the characters interactions and relationships as Joey and her team pursue vengeance . By the midpoint of the novel Chaz is already an emotional wreck and it does n't look like Joey is about to let up any time soon . The moral backbone of the novel is twofold . One is the pitting of the Everglades Forest and her defenders against big business and her pollutants . The Everglades is quickly turning from pristine swamp into another type of ecosystem entirely and many Floridians want to prevent the remaining land from being destroyed , which means millions of dollars loss to the big agricultural business . Hiassin 's two segments on the real life plight of this swamp standout a bit apart from the book , but also lends it a feeling of seriousness . And two is the pitting of criminals against victims who are n't going to take it anymore . Hiassin is at his when he reapetedly refers to the attempted murder as an insult to Joey . As most survivors of violent crime can ascertain there is a severe indignity attached to one 's helplessness . There are six main characters in the book : Joey and her horny husband Chaz , Joey 's rescuer Mick who is a kind and eccentric ex - policeman who lives alone on an island , Joey 's brother , a rich expatriate who raises sheep in New Zealand , Mr. Hammernut , the owner of a large agricultural empire and Tool , the books muscled goon who undergoes a moral transformation . The small group of sub - characters is entertainingly populated in part with a hermit who lives in the swamp , a street - tough hairdresser , a slap - happy senior and a cowardly lawyer . Though similar elements live in many of Hiassin 's works his books never feel like he has used a formula to create them more easily . This ca n't be said for all or most of crime writers and should be accredited to Hiassin 's love for storytelling , his skill as a plot weaver and his ability to evoke so many different emotions . In this line of thought this reviewer took note of the characters subtle ( except for Tool ) character changes throughout the book . Joey for example seemed learn a bit more restraint as she calmed down a little and the same can be said even for characters that have appeared in some of Hiassin 's previous works ( Mick ) . Hiassin has never been a fan of superficial materialism , but the issue is slightly complicated by Skinny Dip and does not simply fall into place along character axes . While the villains all crave money some of the heroes are loaded too . Joey maintains a very frugal existence considering her $ 13 million trust , but her brother spends lavishly . Joey 's rescuer on the other hand lives on a disability check . One may wonder if the only difference between Chaz and his wife is that she never had to work or hustle for a buck , but there is one other way in which the enemies contrast and that is the way they treat their associates . Chaz is continuously scrambling for something and in his desperation - be it for sex , money , or escape - uses other people as tools rather than relating to them as equals . On the other hand , Joey has a good sense of humor and she enjoys the companionship of her pals . Like most of Hiassin 's work this book is not an overly violent one . Although it begins with an attempted murder , the event is quite peaceful . There is no struggle , no blood and the victim , Joey , does not die . After reading Skinny Dip I immediately lent it to my best friend Katie who has not been able to put it down . So , potential readers be warned : Like Katie you may not be able to get any work done for a day or two , but the time is not wasted on Hiassin 's best work to date . One comes away gaining not only pleasant memories of laughs and smiles , but also the feeling that one has poured one more drop into the bucket of our minds that we must fill in order to make this world a better place . In short , Carl Hiassin puts us in touch with the good guys in ourselves",923,1,0.2142725011066973,0.13499142864541702,0.00015151515151516756,0.00015151515151516756,0.00015151515151516756,0.00015151515151516756,0.00015151515151516756,0.06141806118358473,0.00015151515151516756,0.00015151515151516756,0.00015151515151516756,0.00015151515151516756,0.00015151515151516756,0.00015151515151516756,0.00015151515151516756,0.00015151515151516756,0.08253307955946419,0.00015151515151516756,0.00015151515151516756,0.00015151515151516756,0.00015151515151516756,0.014424356760934074,0.00015151515151516756,0.009025931332062056,0.022336323626013357,0.00015151515151516756,0.022362947254250334,0.00015151515151516756,0.00015151515151516756,0.036731930901819726,0.00015151515151516756,0.009681239060591495,0.00015151515151516756,0.00015151515151516756,0.0715692171292278,0.023481000786902885,0.254235608369281,0.00015151515151516756,0.00015151515151516756,0.02238178827190905,0.01525155570881395,0.00015151515151516756,0.00015151515151516756,0.00015151515151516756,0.00015151515151516756,0.00015151515151516756,0.00015151515151516756,0.00015151515151516756,0.00015151515151516756,0.00015151515151516756,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

51242,1,"Stephen King keeping alive the art of the short story First , a few words about each of the four different stories . ""The Man in the Black Suit "" - 3 starsThis is a story about a 9-year - old boy who meets the Devil himself . It 's a very scary experience for the boy , especially because his older brother died the year before and now the Devil tells him that his mother has just died in the same way . This is the weakest of the four stories because the Devil , although being scary , does n't really come across as a serious threat . What kind of second - rate Devil is it that ca n't even catch a boy who decides to run away from him?In "" Everything 's Eventual "" Stephen King writes that this story won a prestigious "" best short story "" award in 1996 , much to his surprise . That surprises me too , because in my opinion this story is not that great . ""All That You Love Will Be Carried Away "" - 5 starsThis is the shortest story ( only 35 minutes ) and one of the two best ones in this collection . Alfie Zimmer is a traveling salesman in the American Midwest . He has an amazing hobby and he 's tired of life . But if he commits suicide , what will everyone think of his hobby?What makes this story so good are the very detailed and evocative descriptions of the conditions under which a traveling salesman lives . Alfie 's strange hobby is also captivating , as are the descriptions of the landscape and isolated towns in the bleak and barren Midwest . In "" Everything 's Eventual "" Stephen King admits that Alfie 's strange hobby was actually something he did himself!""The Death of Jack Hamilton "" - 4 starsThis is a very unusual story for Stephen King . It tells a "" mythical "" story about the 1934 death of Jack Hamilton , member of the John Dillinger gang . Homer Van Meter , another gang member , purportedly tells the story . John Dillinger , Jack Hamilton and Homer Van Meter were all real people . You can find a lot of interesting background information about them by doing an Internet search for John Dillinger . Despite the fact that these were all ruthless gangsters we find ourselves sympathizing with them . Stephen King 's approach to the story is that gangsters are also human beings . The slow death of Jack Hamilton and the efforts of John Dillinger to get him medical help and Dillinger 's distress as Jack Hamilton 's condition worsens are powerful images . ""That Feeling , You Can Only Say What It Is in French "" - 5 starsThis is the best story in the collection . Carol was brought up as a strict Catholic , but then , during the first years of her marriage to Bill , she had an abortion . Now she and Bill are supposed to be celebrating their 25th wedding anniversary and Carol is being subjected to a horrendous punishment for what she did . What makes the story fascinating is that it is not God who is punishing Carol . No , it is Carol , under the influence of her Catholic upbringing , who has prescribed her own punishment . And this punishment Carol is inflicting on herself is much worse than a benevolent God would come up with , even assuming that God considers what Carol did to be wrong . In summary , two very good stories , one good one , and one that 's just OK.The four stories are read by four different professional readers . The total running time is approx . 3 hours 40 minutes , not 4 hours as specified on the packaging . All four of these stories are included in the book "" Everything 's Eventual "" , along with 10 other short stories by Stephen King . If you want to save money or if you dislike audio books then "" Everything 's Eventual "" is a better deal .

51250,1,"Legacy not quite up to standards of EON and ETERNITY I have read almost all of Greg Bear 's books and loved EON and ETERNITY as well as THE FORGE OF GOD and ANVIL OF STARS . I found LEGACY a little disappointing compared to EON and ETERNITY , which preceded them . The narrative spends a lot of time on the human interactions of the characters , and not much time on the technological concepts of the flaw and gate openers , which I missed . I did finish this book and at times was quite spellbound by it . Not Mr. Bear 's best work , but a must - read if you have read EON and ETERNITY",120,1,0.0009090909090909541,0.1915099897371989,0.0009090909090909541,0.0009090909090909541,0.0009090909090909541,0.0476328541539158,0.0009090909090909541,0.1242180801531983,0.0009090909090909541,0.0009090909090909541,0.0009090909090909541,0.0009090909090909541,0.09040048644116759,0.0009090909090909541,0.0009090909090909541,0.0009090909090909541,0.0009090909090909541,0.0009090909090909541,0.0009090909090909541,0.0009090909090909541,0.0009090909090909541,0.0009090909090909541,0.0009090909090909541,0.0009090909090909541,0.0009090909090909541,0.0009090909090909541,0.0009090909090909541,0.0009090909090909541,0.0009090909090909541,0.0009090909090909541,0.0009090909090909541,0.04642507627151308,0.0009090909090909541,0.0009090909090909541,0.0009090909090909541,0.0009090909090909541,0.45981351324300446,0.0009090909090909541,0.0009090909090909541,0.0009090909090909541,0.0009090909090909541,0.0009090909090909541,0.0009090909090909541,0.0009090909090909541,0.0009090909090909541,0.0009090909090909541,0.0009090909090909541,0.0009090909090909541,0.0009090909090909541,0.0009090909090909541,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1

51276,1,"--Powerful and Unforgettable-- GODS AND GENERALS is an extremely well done and fascinating book . The author , Jeff Shaara , did an excellent job of interpreting the characters . His task was a difficult one because his father 's book , THE KILLER ANGELS is a classic in the chronicles of Civil War stories . This book precedes the one written by his father . GODS AND GENERALS takes the reader to the beginning of the Civil War and through many of the battles . The major players in the story are Winfield Scott , Robert E. Lee , Stonewall Jackson , Winfield Hancock and Lawrence Chamberlain . The career biographies of these famous men were striking . After reading of their early lives and service experiences , it gave me a better understanding of just how horrible a civil war was to all of these men who had formerly served together in the Union Army . They were an outstanding group of soldiers and the sadness that they all faced was to go to war against fellow soldiers and friends . I listened to the unabridged books on tape version read by Dick Estell . He brought the characters to life by his narration . This book is well worth the time and truly is an unforgettable part of our history .",224,1,0.00043478260869569653,0.00043478260869569653,0.026797355551573917,0.00043478260869569653,0.00043478260869569653,0.03438857012253117,0.00043478260869569653,0.12049057903619634,0.02783822421047254,0.00043478260869569653,0.00043478260869569653,0.00043478260869569653,0.03986067801254923,0.00043478260869569653,0.00043478260869569653,0.00043478260869569653,0.00043478260869569653,0.00043478260869569653,0.00043478260869569653,0.00043478260869569653,0.00043478260869569653,0.00043478260869569653,0.00043478260869569653,0.00043478260869569653,0.00043478260869569653,0.00043478260869569653,0.033718299067829686,0.00043478260869569653,0.00043478260869569653,0.00043478260869569653,0.00043478260869569653,0.1373550970686685,0.00043478260869569653,0.00043478260869569653,0.0004347826086956966,0.00043478260869569653,0.46882421402050656,0.00043478260869569653,0.027683504648803085,0.00043478260869569653,0.00043478260869569653,0.04391304347826302,0.022173913043473683,0.00043478260869569653,0.00043478260869569653,0.00043478260869569653,0.00043478260869569653,0.00043478260869569653,0.00043478260869569653,0.00043478260869569653,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

He is a New Mexico state police officer who is often teamed up with beautiful FBI agent Diane Lopez who not only knows what Lee Nez is but accepts him for his good heart . Right now they are trying to infiltrate a smuggling ring made up of skinwalkers ( Navaho witches ) who can shape shift at night and still retain their ability to think like a human . These smugglers known as the Silver Eagles go to Mexico in animal form , meet with their suppliers , and return with silver and turquoise for jewelry suppliers who get their products at black market prices . The two cops seek to arrest humans who are part of the smuggling ring and kill the shapeshifters so they no longer can carry out their evil plans .

51289,1,"Excellent ! After reading a book of Sandra Brown 's that I horribly disliked , I was hesitant to give her another shot . I 'm truly glad I did ; The Witness was a first - rate thriller!The villains in this book are greasy , sick individuals that rather turned my stomach ... just what you like when you want to get a taste of Why A Person Would Run For Their Life ! Sandra Brown wrote these characters ( and that of Ricki Sue - who I could easily picture ! ) particularly well . The baby was truly the icing on the cake : this infant motivated Kendall throughout the book and , like any mother , lived for the love of her child . I also loved the sexy , romantic element here - it was just enough that it did n't overwhelm the story ... even better , it did n't change Kendall into a mindless goober ( a state which many female characters in "" romance "" novels often achieve.)The Witness succeeded on so many levels yet fell short of a full five - star rating . Perhaps it was the Crooks ... they came off a bit cliche , but were still necessary characters . Still , this book is an excellent , thought - provoking choice with a WOW ending . Very enjoyable",231,1,0.17597312125762765,0.00047619047619052053,0.00047619047619052053,0.00047619047619052053,0.00047619047619052053,0.02532664992210091,0.00047619047619052053,0.00047619047619052053,0.00047619047619052053,0.00047619047619052053,0.00047619047619052053,0.00047619047619052053,0.00047619047619052053,0.00047619047619052053,0.00047619047619052053,0.00047619047619052053,0.00047619047619052053,0.00047619047619052053,0.00047619047619052053,0.00047619047619052053,0.00047619047619052053,0.00047619047619052053,0.00047619047619052053,0.00047619047619052053,0.00047619047619052053,0.05586074780543576,0.03467991552165548,0.00047619047619052053,0.00047619047619052053,0.04125131816569906,0.00047619047619052053,0.00047619047619052053,0.00047619047619052053,0.00047619047619052053,0.00047619047619052053,0.00047619047619052053,0.41644871681312856,0.00047619047619052053,0.0725174403961608,0.00047619047619052053,0.00047619047619052053,0.048095238095239926,0.00047619047619052053,0.00047619047619052053,0.11032304249914052,0.00047619047619052053,0.00047619047619052053,0.00047619047619052053,0.00047619047619052053,0.00047619047619052053,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0
51298,1,Very Interesting ! ! This book was so different from what I thought it was about when I ordered it . It still was knowledgeable . It is hard to grasp as you must actually do the experimentation . I also thought the illustrations should be in color since that is what the book is about . It has some examples in the beginning of the book but I hate to keep looking around in books I personally like it to appear in front of me as I read . It was a very interesting book to say the least,100,1,0.0010526315789474191,0.0010526315789474191,0.0010526315789474191,0.0010526315789474191,0.0010526315789474191,0.0010526315789474191,0.0010526315789474191,0.0010526315789474191,0.06136988418099213,0.0010526315789474191,0.0010526315789474191,0.0010526315789474191,0.0010526315789474191,0.0010526315789474191,0.0010526315789474191,0.0010526315789474191,0.0010526315789474191,0.0010526315789474191,0.0010526315789474191,0.0010526315789474191,0.0010526315789474191,0.0010526315789474191,0.0010526315789474191,0.0010526315789474191,0.0010526315789474191,0.0010526315789474191,0.0010526315789474191,0.0010526315789474191,0.0010526315789474191,0.0010526315789474191,0.0010526315789474191,0.0010526315789474191,0.0010526315789474191,0.0010526315789474191,0.0010526315789474191,0.0010526315789474191,0.8881038000295319,0.0010526315789474191,0.0010526315789474191,0.0010526315789474191,0.0010526315789474191,0.0010526315789474191,0.0010526315789474191,0.0010526315789474191,0.0010526315789474191,0.0010526315789474191,0.0010526315789474191,0.0010526315789474191,0.0010526315789474191,0.0010526315789474191,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1

51301,1,"Insightful and possibly life - saving The insights here are simple , straightforward and profound . It explains how modern society can sometimes put men into a no - win situation , resulting in a feeling of frustration , impotence , incompetence , and depression . The only socially acceptable way to express it is rage ( even though rage is vilified , I can tell you that showing hurt , pain and weakness invites scorn , distain and disrespect , even from those who purport to love us ) . By explaining how we get into this trap , it helps us to understand it and thus gives us a chance to find a way out . I wish I could give a copy of this book to every man and woman in the world . I see so much of it played out every day all around us , and the pain both men and women feel because of it does so much damage . Read it before you have a crisis if you can , but if you are already in crisis , make the effort to read this book even if you ca n't read anything else . It might even save your life .

51302,1,"Fable of Unintended Consequences It was a cold and snowy February day when a stranger walked to a small country inn and ordered a meal and a private room . This stranger guards his privacy and desires solitude . His luggage consists of many bottles of powders and fluids as would be used by an experimental investigator . The local general practitioner visits the stranger , and sees something he ca n't believe . Then someone steals money from the Reverend Bunting although he and his wife see nobody . Later Mr. Mrs. Hall , innkeepers , see the stranger 's room is empty , until the chair moves around as if possessed by spirits . When questioned by Mrs. Hall the stranger removes his nose ! Then the bandages and spectacles go , and the people see no head ! When the constable comes to arrest him , the man removes all his garments and disappears into thin air . The crowd tries to grab him but he escapes . Mr. Thomas Marvel , a wandering tramp , is found by this Unseen and convinced to work for him . They return to the inn to fetch books and clothing . This sets off a commotion among the people there , and another chase . The panicked people fled from the streets and locked themselves in their homes . There was a story about "" flying money "" that was removed from shops and inns . At another inn Marvel seeks shelter , he has escaped from the Invisible Man . When this Unseen enters to take Marvel away , a bearded American fires at the Unseen with his revolver . Later the Unseen visits a physician for treatment of his wound ( his blood can be seen ) . The Unseen has met Dr. Kemp at college , and is fed and clothed . The Unseen explains the scientific principles of optical density in a general way . If the refractive index of a substance was lowered to that of air it would be invisible in most cases ( Chapter XIX ) . The Unseen kept his work secret because of the thefts in the scientific world of science . But the Unseen acquired money by foul means which cursed his work ! Griffin tells of the previous experiments that led to invisibility ( Chapter XX ) . The next chapters gives Griffin 's history . But Kemp has written to the police , and they arrive . Griffin escapes once again , and Kemp warns the police about what must be done ( Chapter XXV ) . Griffin is mad and inhuman , "" pure selfishness "" . His attempts to kill Kemp lead to his own destruction , and his body becomes visible after death ( Chapter XXVIII ) . If accurate , this story provides a snapshot of life in London and its suburbs at that time . It also tells that carrying arms was nothing unusual . H. G. Wells shows his literary skills in making believable an impossible condition . There are those who still believe that describing something in words makes it real ( like "" childproof guns "" , etc . ) . Readers of Wells ' later works can judge how close to the truth his writings were . This fable warns against uncontrolled scientific experiments , from poison gas to atomic bombs , or the current craze for cloning or "" genetic modification "" The story of unseen theft of money can also be a warning against a Private Banking Cartel and its continual devaluation of the currency to help Big Business in its struggle against small businesses and working people .

51308,1,"Interesting cartoon and puzzle combo Is this a book of New Yorker cartoons or a puzzle book ? Well , it 's a little of both , and the result is a novel way to laugh and exercise your brain at the same time . Most of the 83 puzzles consist of cartoons that are missing words , captions , or picture components . By figuring out the missing elements and sometimes combining them with acrostics , crossword puzzles , or other word grids , the cartoon humor is revealed . For the most part , the puzzles are of only moderate difficulty , although there are a few difficult ones ( at least for me ) that involve matching a cartoon with the decade in which it was created or matching cartoons from early and late in a cartoonist 's career . Frequent puzzle solvers will recognize many of the familiar puzzle types from Games Magazine and other media that Puzzability publishes in . The foreword to the book contains a casual and loosely coupled conversation between New Yorker cartoon editor Robert Mankoff and New York Times puzzle editor Will Shortz . This is an entertaining book that you 'll hate to throw away when it 's been completed because of all the witty cartoons it contains .

51312,1,"Min Cui 's Review Narrated through the heartfelt voice of Amy Tan , the Kitchen God 's Wife illustrates a compelling story of heritage and self - discovery . As a young Chinese woman , Winnie Louie , the main character and the conduit through which Tan expresses her voice , must endure an atrocious life under the abuse and torture of her wicked husband Wen Fu , a pretentious , arrogant , and egregious man who not only cheated his way up the military ladder , but also committed numerous felons including rape , murder , blackmailing , and extortion . Day after day , beating after beating , Winnie slowly begins to realize that in order to escape from Wen Fu and start a new life free from violence and marked by love , radical and immediate actions must be taken . When dealing with someone without even a modicum of human decency , someone like Wen Fu , the usual , traditional , and orthodox actions are futile . Striking a perfect chord between concision and elaboration , Tan keeps the reader constantly engaged as the dramatic story of Winnie unfolds itself . Relying mostly on authentic voice and keeping the meretricious elements to a minimum , Tan narrates the novel with surprising precision and unmatched beauty . Against the magnificent backdrops of a WWII - era China , the novel reassures the universal nature of mankind , that the problems troubling people today are experienced by all generations , regardless of race , nationality , or social status . As you read this rare gem amount literature , open the introspective window and enjoy the novel with your heart .",284,1,0.0004651162790698052,0.03269522708888949,0.0004651162790698052,0.0004651162790698052,0.0004651162790698052,0.0004651162790698052,0.0004651162790698052,0.36816140721156826,0.12376725145968571,0.0004651162790698052,0.0004651162790698052,0.0004651162790698052,0.0004651162790698052,0.0004651162790698052,0.0004651162790698052,0.0004651162790698052,0.0004651162790698052,0.0004651162790698052,0.0004651162790698052,0.0311066085489052,0.0004651162790698052,0.0004651162790698052,0.0004651162790698052,0.0004651162790698052,0.0004651162790698052,0.059037040471564564,0.0004651162790698052,0.0004651162790698052,0.0004651162790698052,0.0004651162790698052,0.0004651162790698052,0.0004651162790698052,0.0004651162790698052,0.0004651162790698052,0.1316437549990336,0.023976830110127863,0.17814712447705203,0.0004651162790698052,0.0004651162790698052,0.0004651162790698052,0.0004651162790698052,0.0004651162790698052,0.0004651162790698052,0.0004651162790698052,0.03239498819131115,0.0004651162790698052,0.0004651162790698052,0.0004651162790698052,0.0004651162790698052,0.0004651162790698052,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

51319,1,"Eye - Opening Book for Those Interested in Place or Language Though you may not immediately think that there is a connection between language and the places where you live and pass through , your sense of your surroundings and of language itself will be transformed after you read Gaston Bachelard 's quot;The Poetics of Space . quot ; Bachelard argues that language -- especially poetry -- can reveal hidden aspects of our experience of space , especially of our home space . For example , he considers how common phrases such as quot;go up to the attic quot ; and quot;go down to the basement quot ; are revelatory of our typical sense that stairs to an attic are stairs one ascends , while stairs to the basement are stairs one descends -- in spite of the fact that both sets of stairs must be equally ascended and descended . As he does with other such observations , Bachelard extends his observation regarding the directionality of different staircases into a discussion of how the attic and basement hold different roles in our daily and imaginary lives . In addition to exploring how we experience space and place , Bachelard equally attends to the way in which language can function either as a daily and common means of communication or as a site of new and creative insight ; roughly speaking , he argues that poetry happens when the motions of language itself open us up to a new way of seeing or understanding something . By reading this beautifully written and engaging book , you will likely come to understand or see anew experiences from childhood through adulthood that pertain to places where your have lived , grown up , felt comfortable or alienated , had a feeling of wonder or fear , etc . I recommend this book to anyone interested in the experience of place or space , in language and what it can reveal to us , or in what counts as poetry rather than as common everyday language",343,1,0.11335190929963541,0.12414087673442274,0.0003448275862069255,0.0003448275862069255,0.10405373185204914,0.0003448275862069255,0.0003448275862069255,0.0003448275862069255,0.0003448275862069255,0.0003448275862069255,0.0003448275862069255,0.0003448275862069255,0.0003448275862069255,0.0003448275862069255,0.0003448275862069255,0.0003448275862069255,0.0003448275862069255,0.0003448275862069255,0.0003448275862069255,0.0003448275862069255,0.0003448275862069255,0.0003448275862069255,0.0003448275862069255,0.0003448275862069255,0.0003448275862069255,0.0003448275862069255,0.0003448275862069255,0.0003448275862069255,0.0003448275862069255,0.0003448275862069255,0.0003448275862069255,0.0003448275862069255,0.0003448275862069255,0.0003448275862069255,0.1325268051307639,0.0003448275862069255,0.2428915974216779,0.2678626657683462,0.0003448275862069255,0.0003448275862069255,0.0003448275862069255,0.0003448275862069255,0.0003448275862069255,0.0003448275862069255,0.0003448275862069255,0.0003448275862069255,0.0003448275862069255,0.0003448275862069255,0.0003448275862069255,0.0003448275862069255,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
51334,1,"An absolute masterpiece "" Spring Snow "" is unquestionably one of the finest Japanese novels ever written , as well as being a masterpiece of world literature in its own right . It is an eloquent , moving story with a "" tale as old as time , "" that of star - crossed lovers who 's love transcends social roles and obligations . In another culture , with another writer , this would be a romantic , if not happy , story . But this is Japan , and the writer is Mishima Yukio . In his hands , the lovers Kiyoaki and Satoko transcend literary stereotypes , and become agents of their own happiness and destruction . By the very nature of their relationship , raised together since childhood , playing a complicated cat - and - mouse game of love and sexual tension , their future is never in doubt . It is impressive that a writer such as Mishima , known for his right - wing politics and his samurai dreams , could craft such a tender love story . While knowing the eventual conclusion , the reader savors and hopes for each stolen moment of happiness between Kiyoaki and Satoko , and knows that even their despair is something to be treasured because it is shared . Not that it is a clear path . Even knowing Japanese literature , and the road it usually takes , there are surprises on the way . Things do not turn out the way one would expect . I was incredibly moved by "" Spring Snow . "" It is a novel that affects the heart of the reader , and lingers long after the last page is turned .",292,1,0.10919707877569534,0.21488803916515453,0.0005405405405406085,0.0005405405405406085,0.0005405405405406085,0.0005405405405406085,0.0005405405405406085,0.0005405405405406085,0.0005405405405406085,0.0005405405405406085,0.0005405405405406085,0.0005405405405406085,0.0005405405405406085,0.0005405405405406085,0.0005405405405406085,0.0005405405405406085,0.0005405405405406085,0.0005405405405406085,0.0005405405405406085,0.0005405405405406085,0.0005405405405406085,0.0005405405405406085,0.03930358028227544,0.0005405405405406085,0.04113852831999275,0.05983313841522067,0.0005405405405406085,0.0005405405405406085,0.0005405405405406085,0.0005405405405406085,0.0005405405405406085,0.0005405405405406085,0.0005405405405406085,0.0005405405405406085,0.16105609932376946,0.0005405405405406085,0.2887942363672128,0.0005405405405406085,0.0005405405405406085,0.0005405405405406085,0.0005405405405406085,0.0005405405405406085,0.0005405405405406085,0.0005405405405406085,0.0005405405405406085,0.0005405405405406085,0.06308659664797348,0.0005405405405406085,0.0005405405405406085,0.0005405405405406085,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
51335,1,"Rational Analysis I read the second edition of this book since it is enlarged with the study of the housing market . The phenomenon of bubbles and negative bubbles or collapses is described extremely well by means of statistical data of markets for over a century and a half . The raw data is adjusted to inflation to give a realistic perspective of the trends and patterns . Bubbles seem to be occurring at regular intervals typically based on the "" new era "" story and everyone believes at least during the heady days that good times are here to stay . But as shown by proven evidence of the past , no bubble has sustained itself permanently and good reason prevails sooner or later . When this happens , the bloated bubble collapses and the hangover is terrible . The story so far is quite simple . But what makes this book so interesting is the depth of research and the manner in which the phenomenon is studied and explained . The combination of mass psychology and market prices is at the core of this book . For bubbles to happen , information flow is the key . Media plays a significant role in disseminating information and bubbles seem to have originated in recorded history after the advent of the print media . In recent times electronic media particularly the television and the internet play a significant role in speeding up bubble formation and also the reversals . Media needs a storyline and this story needs to be continued to retain customers on a daily basis . Stock market is the ideal place that offers an opportunity to try one 's luck if a casino is far away . Backed by on - line dedicated news channels and internet trading , well , it is not surprising that we have day traders in herds . In such situations fundamentals like industry analysis and P / E ratios take a backseat as explained by the author . Historical averages are breached and a euphoria of "" once in a life time opportunity "" prevails . What happens to the Efficient Markets Theory in such situations ? . Since this theory says that markets are perfectly priced based on all publicly available information there can not be a situation of either under pricing or over pricing . This book perfectly challenges the efficiency and accuracy of this theory . It is unfortunate that substantial amounts of investments meant to be otherwise risk free sources of income , pension funds for example , are getting diverted into risky markets . Here the author has come out with a list of some sound proposals to protect hard earned life long savings of innocent citizens who are exposed to the irrationality of markets . The bubble in the housing market is also discussed well . Housing seems to be isolated bubbles occurring in specific regions and not a global phenomenon . But nevertheless the damage can be the same . The party of low interest rate regime seems to be over and a spike in mortgage rates is sure to be the needle that will prick right through this big speculative bubble . What goes up has to come down ! But once you start reading this book , it is difficult to put it down . Intellectually stimulating and bound to be economically rewarding .",572,1,0.09458423454177378,0.11733819970574069,0.014337615858332379,0.0002739726027397591,0.0002739726027397591,0.0002739726027397591,0.0002739726027397591,0.0002739726027397591,0.046549061148659594,0.0002739726027397591,0.0002739726027397591,0.0002739726027397591,0.0002739726027397591,0.0002739726027397591,0.01397260261888384,0.0002739726027397591,0.0002739726027397591,0.0002739726027397591,0.0002739726027397591,0.0002739726027397591,0.0002739726027397591,0.0002739726027397591,0.0002739726027397591,0.0002739726027397591,0.05102439340603617,0.0002739726027397591,0.045875274991026616,0.0002739726027397591,0.015333460559214933,0.013075311380332067,0.0002739726027397591,0.012449205281505947,0.08458675164085742,0.0002739726027397591,0.0002739726027397591,0.0002739726027397591,0.4136105252506534,0.0002739726027397591,0.0002739726027397591,0.0002739726027397591,0.0002739726027397591,0.0002739726027397591,0.0002739726027397591,0.0002739726027397591,0.06712637731561232,0.0002739726027397591,0.0002739726027397591,0.0002739726027397591,0.0002739726027397591,0.0002739726027397591,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

51339,1,"level headed reading : Jesus in his own context in order to properly understand the Jesus of the new testament , instead of making a Jesus of our own liking , it is necessary to understand Jesus as he himself indicated . Jesus himself , according to the new testament , made constant reference and allusion to the hebrew scriptures , ( old testament ) , as he sought to explain himself , his actions , his teachings and his significance . Understanding the old testament is therefore of paramount importance for understanding what Jesus was and is about . This means far more than knowing some of the messianic proof texts or knowing about Noahs ark or the temple and sacrificial system of the ancient hebrews . Understanding the old testament involves knowing the overall aim and purpose of it , and how it all is held together by connected themes that form a unified whole . Christopher Wright 's book , Knowing Jesus Through the Old Testament , is an absolute Godsend towards getting the drift of the old testament and how it carries forward to the Jesus of the new testament . This book is a little bit technical at times , it is not a devotional work , but reading this book will educate a person to accurately understand what the old testament is about and how it flows into the person of Jesus , thereby expositing the true meaning and intent of Jesus according to the background that Jesus himself referred to . Thanks Chris Wright for this fabulous book . Also see his forthcoming book , The Mission of God , due out in fall of 2006 by intervarsity press . It looks to be another bullseye ! ! For some other great little books on Jesus that are sane and sober , see : Jesus and His World by Peter Walker , The Original Jesus by N.T. Wright , and for a bit of a larger work see Jesus and The Gospels by Craig Blomberg",342,1,0.26236140334816854,0.16117830383938814,0.0004545454545454823,0.0004545454545454823,0.026781691115484153,0.0004545454545454823,0.0004545454545454823,0.046374480799995454,0.0004545454545454823,0.0004545454545454823,0.0004545454545454823,0.0004545454545454823,0.0004545454545454823,0.0004545454545454823,0.0004545454545454823,0.0004545454545454823,0.0004545454545454823,0.0004545454545454823,0.0004545454545454823,0.0004545454545454823,0.0004545454545454823,0.0004545454545454823,0.0004545454545454823,0.16649563209542176,0.0004545454545454823,0.0004545454545454823,0.0004545454545454823,0.0004545454545454823,0.0004545454545454823,0.0004545454545454823,0.0004545454545454823,0.0004545454545454823,0.02137458560051817,0.0004545454545454823,0.0004545454545454823,0.0004545454545454823,0.29588844865556807,0.0004545454545454823,0.0004545454545454823,0.0004545454545454823,0.0004545454545454823,0.0004545454545454823,0.0004545454545454823,0.0004545454545454823,0.0004545454545454823,0.0004545454545454823,0.0004545454545454823,0.0004545454545454823,0.0004545454545454823,0.0004545454545454823,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

51346,1,"Looking Through a Glass Darkly ? The mysterious oriental mirror is ugly , and it has powers that wield themselves on the unexpected . It wreaks havoc and sometimes kills , as is the case with several people in this book . The rest are either thought mad or driven mad . Question : If you could , would you switch places with somebody else in a different time ? I think I might , but I would like to be given a choice . Brandy McCabe and her granddaughter Shay Garrett are n't given that choice . Both are 20 years old and about to marry men neither love when the mirror transports them into each other 's bodies . Marlys Millhiser has woven a complex and fascinating story of culture shock in which Brandy becomes her granddaughter and Shay becomes her grandmother . Shay is thought crazy in the early 1900s because she can tell the future , and she keeps a diary to tell her grandmother how she has lived out her life should she return to her own body one day . Her story and how she deals with a pre - citified Boulder , Colorado is the most interesting segment of the book , but I did n't feel sorry for Shay as much as I admired her strength of character . She also had her mother 's stories of her ancestors to go on , but this was not the case for poor Brandy . The Garrett 's and Shay 's fiancee ' do n't know what to do with a pregnant Shay who is terrified and clueless about the year 1978 , but they know after discovering the diary that she really is Brandy . The story is often heartbreaking , often times quite funny , and there are so many supporting and unforgettable characters -- like the lovable Thora K. , Brandy 's first mother - in - law and the old man who takes care of Shay when she runs away from her family -- that this book is not only compelling , but also makes you think about your own place in this world . What Shay and Brandy do have in common is Rachel , Brandy 's daughter and Shay 's mother . Now picture those two being in each other 's place when you think of that ! Somebody here called the book a literary classic ; I would n't go that far , but it is excellent , regardless . The Mirror is magical storytelling any way you look at it , so let it weave it 's spell on you .",445,1,0.00027777777777780114,0.00027777777777780114,0.01563744721732245,0.00027777777777780114,0.00027777777777780114,0.00027777777777780114,0.00027777777777780114,0.10297336032140188,0.00027777777777780114,0.00027777777777780114,0.00027777777777780114,0.00027777777777780114,0.25915039522759636,0.00027777777777780114,0.00027777777777780114,0.00027777777777780114,0.00027777777777780114,0.00027777777777780114,0.01416666666666601,0.00027777777777780114,0.00027777777777780114,0.00027777777777780114,0.00027777777777780114,0.020126387740776498,0.00027777777777780114,0.00027777777777780114,0.03686351928963277,0.00027777777777780114,0.00027777777777780114,0.021050761000243782,0.00027777777777780114,0.00027777777777780114,0.06830046704023286,0.00027777777777780114,0.12879321853035852,0.00027777777777780114,0.1473302833955896,0.00027777777777780114,0.017903804965021884,0.00027777777777780114,0.00027777777777780114,0.052119133104186935,0.00027777777777780114,0.00027777777777780114,0.00027777777777780114,0.10530677772319198,0.00027777777777780114,0.00027777777777780114,0.00027777777777780114,0.00027777777777780114,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
51350,1,"Exciting and provoking I was stunned to see so many critical reviews of this book here . Even more stunned by the criticisms . This is not a scientific treatise , and never pretends to be . This is not an introduction into the more abstract and obscure aspects of Emergence , nor is it a dry and tedious mathematical paper . This is an interesting , graspable , exciting and intelligently written book about a phenomenon which is absolutely , positively crucial to understand . To some people Emergence is a particular abstract in a particular field - those people were disappointed and found this "" light reading "" - which is really too bad , because they are the ones who NEED this book the most . Alas , we can expect it to be a while before these "" scientist "" can look outside their own shallow mud - puddles of their over - specialties to see how applicable emergent theory is to the world we are immersed in , both natural and man - made . If you did n't find this book exciting , you did n't read it . Sit down and read it without distraction and prejudice . Let Johnson do what he does best ; take you on a journey of ideas and concepts . Sure , some of it is simplified for the lay - reader , but anybody who is n't a total couch - potato is going to find the content interesting enough to set - out and search for details on their own . It is n't Johnson 's goal to elaborate on some trivial and fragmentary specialty that only people with masters degrees and secured positions in academia could possibly enjoy or tolerate . His goal is to show what emergence IS and why it is SO important , how vast the concepts are in their potential application in every imaginable field , and how elegant , simple , complex , chaotic , and BEAUTIFUL emergence IS ! And he does exactly this quite well . If you read this book and are not excited , you did n't get it . Read it again . And again . Look up the examples of emergence , and try to actually find your own examples of emergence in YOUR world , in YOUR daily experience . The enrichment you 'll gain from it will be worth a lot more than any silly over - specialty in an obscure field of research that nobody has ever hear",428,1,0.07043440627864672,0.00035714285714288327,0.00035714285714288327,0.037098126704476264,0.00035714285714288327,0.00035714285714288327,0.00035714285714288327,0.15838407838076604,0.00035714285714288327,0.00035714285714288327,0.00035714285714288327,0.00035714285714288327,0.15444886259238474,0.00035714285714288327,0.00035714285714288327,0.00035714285714288327,0.00035714285714288327,0.00035714285714288327,0.00035714285714288327,0.00035714285714288327,0.00035714285714288327,0.00035714285714288327,0.00035714285714288327,0.00035714285714288327,0.00035714285714288327,0.054250829881704335,0.00035714285714288327,0.00035714285714288327,0.00035714285714288327,0.00035714285714288327,0.00035714285714288327,0.00035714285714288327,0.00035714285714288327,0.00035714285714288327,0.00035714285714288327,0.00035714285714288327,0.34996310986214874,0.00035714285714288327,0.00035714285714288327,0.00035714285714288327,0.00035714285714288327,0.00035714285714288327,0.00035714285714288327,0.00035714285714288327,0.1600634434427293,0.00035714285714288327,0.00035714285714288327,0.00035714285714288327,0.00035714285714288327,0.00035714285714288327,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

51355,1,"Excellent classic book on toxic shame and how to deal with it This is in my opinion John Bradshaw 's best book . It encapsulates his thinking on the area of toxic shame and demonstrates how this phenomenon is at the core of compulsions , addictions , co - dependencies and our need to achieve beyond what is really necessary or serves our larger purposes . In this volume , John Bradshaw demonstrates how toxic shame develops and leads to the breakdown of families . He also talks about how this cycle is perpetuated through generations and actually covers a lot of ground in terms of family dynamics . Through affirmations , working with feelings , visualizations and other techniques , the author shows the reader how to work through toxic shame . As someone who has done the work himself , he comes across as compassionate , knowledgeable and very practical . Sometimes I get annoyed when I read this book because of unnecessary repetition of some key concepts . This is the explanation for my 4 rating , along with the fact that many of his books overlap each other with respect to content . Therefore , my overall rating is that this is a solid , well - written classic that certainly deserves its best - seller status .

51382,1,"Never travel the same route twice ! Ibn Batuta describes his encounters with peoples and lands west of his native Tangiers ( Morocco ) in the 14 C. By avoiding to travel the same route twice , he comes to the same places a number of times ( Baghdad , Delhi ) spinning and zigzagging his ways through mountains and seas . As he explores with brio this world , he unfolds himself and as in most cross - cultural encounters , this maybe one of the most interesting features of the book . He accepts miraculous events with a candor I have not found in any other Middle Age traveler of those lands ( from Marco Polo to the Jesuits ) . He gives little description of the way people live in the places he visits - which I regret - apart from detailed descriptions of the gowns and other garments he is given by some of the Sheikhs of the places he visits . The descriptions of how those sheikhs succeeded to govern illustrate how ( extremely ) fragile power was and is in those regions . Names are sometimes difficult to relate to those we know - which is regretful . Do n't follow Ibn Batuta 's advice , read ( and enjoy ) the book twice",220,1,0.0008333333333334149,0.0008333333333334149,0.0008333333333334149,0.0008333333333334149,0.0008333333333334149,0.0008333333333334149,0.0008333333333334149,0.2527504859973769,0.0008333333333334149,0.0008333333333334149,0.0008333333333334149,0.0008333333333334149,0.0008333333333334149,0.0008333333333334149,0.0008333333333334149,0.0008333333333334149,0.0008333333333334149,0.0008333333333334149,0.0008333333333334149,0.0008333333333334149,0.0008333333333334149,0.0008333333333334149,0.0008333333333334149,0.0008333333333334149,0.0008333333333334149,0.0008333333333334149,0.04363988694002136,0.0008333333333334149,0.0008333333333334149,0.0008333333333334149,0.0008333333333334149,0.0008333333333334149,0.0008333333333334149,0.0008333333333334149,0.15399338443676228,0.0008333333333334149,0.35312985559148974,0.0008333333333334149,0.0008333333333334149,0.0008333333333334149,0.0008333333333334149,0.042544048388965805,0.0008333333333334149,0.0008333333333334149,0.0008333333333334149,0.11727567197871389,0.0008333333333334149,0.0008333333333334149,0.0008333333333334149,0.0008333333333334149,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

51395,1,""" I was cut out for finer things . "" The narrator of Joe Perrotta 's novel "" Joe College "" is Danny , an English major at Yale . Stuck with the peculiarities of his roommates , and with a horrendous crush on a fellow student named Polly , Danny struggles to complete his junior year . While home in New Jersey on a summer break , Danny drives his father 's lunch wagon "" The Roach Coach . "" And this is how he meets Cindy , a pleasant , chatty secretary . Danny compares her to the girls on the Yale campus , and the comparison is not flattering to Cindy . He 's faintly embarrassed by her , and while she 's ok to date when he 's home in New Jersey , he 's ashamed of the relationship when he returns to Yale . Once again , Perrotta presents the theme of escape from New Jersey , and in the novel , Danny 's escape is temporarily through Yale , but ultimately through education . Cindy represents everything Danny is trying to escape -- a lifetime driving the Roach Coach , and Danny knows far too many people who made huge mistakes and ended up trapped forever in New Jersey . Class is another theme in the novel -- during the school year , Danny works in a cafeteria . The employees and the Townies are all too well aware that their lives are mapped out -- whereas the Yale students seem to have vast , limitless opportunities . While Danny 's background is humble , and his parents have made tremendous sacrifices to send him to Yale , he rubs shoulders with peers who come from incredibly wealthy homes . To them , Yale does n't quite hold the desperate stakes that face Danny . When it comes to making some rather questionable moral choices , Danny nakedly examines his motives , and simply shrugs . While this does not make Danny a heroic narrator , it certainly makes him very real and very human . As a Perrotta fan , I hope that the author rediscovers Danny in another novel . In "" Joe College "" Danny 's moral fibre is still quite plastic , and he may prove to be fascinating in middle age -- displacedhuma",394,1,0.00040816326530616616,0.23147555456897173,0.024013786664117315,0.00040816326530616616,0.00040816326530616616,0.00040816326530616616,0.00040816326530616616,0.1530781110207132,0.00040816326530616616,0.00040816326530616616,0.00040816326530616616,0.00040816326530616616,0.00040816326530616616,0.00040816326530616616,0.00040816326530616616,0.00040816326530616616,0.00040816326530616616,0.00040816326530616616,0.00040816326530616616,0.00040816326530616616,0.00040816326530616616,0.00040816326530616616,0.00040816326530616616,0.06240353404262734,0.00040816326530616616,0.022051068908003263,0.00040816326530616616,0.00040816326530616616,0.00040816326530616616,0.040594750642808236,0.00040816326530616616,0.00040816326530616616,0.029877667297691302,0.00040816326530616616,0.128279789465169,0.00040816326530616616,0.15169951505132098,0.021539014153690274,0.03308913269229152,0.06482306929548116,0.00040816326530616616,0.021972965380786573,0.00040816326530616616,0.00040816326530616616,0.00040816326530616616,0.00040816326530616616,0.00040816326530616616,0.00040816326530616616,0.00040816326530616616,0.00040816326530616616,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

51401,1,"A good summer read ! Kate White introduces us to the world of tabloid reporting in a sassy titillating crime novel -- Over Her Dead Body . I could feel the slime drip off the characters that were responsible for keeping the Buzz and its rag competitors in production . While the mention of ' current ' celebrities will date this book , Kate 's spellbinding storytelling definitely has staying power . Over Her Dead Body is a fast - paced novel about the murder of the Mona Hodges , Editor in Chief of the Buzz , who had a long list of hostages in her wake , each one having good reason to hate her or perhaps kill her - with a sprinkling of romance for levity . Even though the main character , Bailey Weggins , a celebrity crime writer , gets discombobulated many times throughout the investigation , she is clever enough to pull together the pieces of the mystery to its conclusion . Right to the end Kate White keeps the reader guessing on who did this horrible crime . I am looking forward to reading more Bailey Weggins ' mysteries .

51405,1,"almost , but not quite ... A looming 21-year High School reunion has led me to ponder the past , especially the town I grew up in . I have been reading The Geography of Nowhere by James Howard Kuntsler , a book which explores the rise of suburbia and automobile culture in America . Kuntsler explores the effects of modernist design philosophy ( Le Corbusier , Gropius , Bauhaus etc . ) . Although Kunstler 's book is by no means a complete history , his insights are provocative . His basic thesis is that the rise of the automobile has led to the development of a banal and meaningless quot;geography of nowhere quot ; . In other words , since the 1920s , Americans have pursued a single - minded vision when it comes to urban development : namely treating our built surroundings as disposable commodities to be bought and sold , with little regard to aesthetics . Growing up in a suburb , I experienced this sort of fake - non - reality - bubble of what a city should be , or what it should do for its residents . There was always nothing to do , nowhere to go . Fortunately , in those days , creative people created their own quot;scene quot ; , no matter how lame it was . Such a naive scene based on our libertine tastes and overbearing ignorance . Of course , conformity was the rule . And we all nearly s -- t ourselves when we got behind the wheel of our first car . It was almost like and 5-year - old 's first trip to Disneyland . It was like that first sexual experience . It was an epiphany , of sorts . Little did we realize that our addiction to auto travel would bring such a high cost to our lonely empty souls . Who ever thought that being so cheap would cost us so much ?",332,1,0.10979743598448632,0.0004444444444444947,0.0004444444444444947,0.0004444444444444947,0.0004444444444444947,0.0004444444444444947,0.02510299575056069,0.0004444444444444947,0.024514003300520604,0.0004444444444444947,0.0004444444444444947,0.0004444444444444947,0.0004444444444444947,0.0004444444444444947,0.0004444444444444947,0.0004444444444444947,0.0004444444444444947,0.028684967110025918,0.0004444444444444947,0.023589441375641156,0.0004444444444444947,0.0004444444444444947,0.0004444444444444947,0.07690917139430398,0.0004444444444444947,0.11306299217557435,0.0004444444444444947,0.0004444444444444947,0.0004444444444444947,0.0004444444444444947,0.0004444444444444947,0.0004444444444444947,0.03037382562237789,0.0004444444444444947,0.0004444444444444947,0.0004444444444444947,0.14234061531162873,0.12662659156978215,0.0004444444444444947,0.0004444444444444947,0.0004444444444444947,0.0004444444444444947,0.0004444444444444947,0.092168729446434,0.18994034206977328,0.0004444444444444947,0.0004444444444444947,0.0004444444444444947,0.0004444444444444947,0.0004444444444444947,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0

His disciplined , almost scientific investigation is an example of non - partisan coverage of a crucial issue . If only a few politicians were as concerned with the public interest as McChesney , we would be in a better world . I am a Mexican citizen so I could n't care less about U.S. partisan politics , and if you care about the fate of public communications , you should n't either . This is a problem that affects every country , not just the U.S.A. , since the big telecommunication companies are broadcasting all over the World . The interest of big advertisers is being protected by U.S. policy and their marketing messages are then blasted everywhere . Even the smallest community in the South - Mexican jungles knows Ronald McDonald . CNN has Latin editions of their biased news transmitted to most Latin countries . As an outsider , I hope the U.S. citizenry will realize that this is not an issue of Democrats vs. Republicans but a World - wide issue of the individual vs. the big corporations .

The book itself will not do wonders unless you work on the things Gawain suggests .

51442,1,"Another winner from the author of THE FOUR AGREEMENTS ! I loved THE FOUR AGREEMENTS by Don Miguel Ruiz , in which heshared wisdom from his Toltec ancestors . . . it helped me and I 'm surecountless others develop a simple , yet effective code of personalconduct . So when I had the chance to listen to his follow - up book , THE MASTERYOF LOVE , I naturally was intrigued by the possibility of gaining somemore valuable insights from the author -- this time dealing with thesubject of both developing and maintaining a loving relationship . Perhaps my only disappointment in this title was that it was tooshort . . . I gained so much from it that after one listening , Iimmediately felt the need to go back and listen a second time . . . methinksthat if you were reading it , you 'd do the same , if just to master thisone concept : To try to change somebody is to try to change a dog or cat . You lovethem for who they are . If you 're with somebody , do n't try to changehim or her . Also , there were these other valuable tidbits : Let go of the past and begin every day with a high level of love . If you do n't love yourself , you can change your belief and yourlife will change . When you hear your heart guiding you to happiness , make a choiceand stick to it . Forgive others , and you will see miracles happen in your life . And lastly , there was this one that really struck home : If your choice is to be in a relationship and your partner is playingthe same game . . . what a gift !",302,1,0.00054054054054058,0.13226826630405436,0.00054054054054058,0.09040079645449213,0.00054054054054058,0.027578999579762068,0.00054054054054058,0.00054054054054058,0.00054054054054058,0.00054054054054058,0.00054054054054058,0.00054054054054058,0.00054054054054058,0.00054054054054058,0.00054054054054058,0.00054054054054058,0.00054054054054058,0.00054054054054058,0.00054054054054058,0.00054054054054058,0.00054054054054058,0.00054054054054058,0.00054054054054058,0.00054054054054058,0.00054054054054058,0.34464952286312717,0.00054054054054058,0.00054054054054058,0.00054054054054058,0.00054054054054058,0.00054054054054058,0.00054054054054058,0.00054054054054058,0.00054054054054058,0.03459612923113948,0.00054054054054058,0.23336701169113622,0.00054054054054058,0.00054054054054058,0.00054054054054058,0.00054054054054058,0.00054054054054058,0.00054054054054058,0.00054054054054058,0.08246904474477673,0.00054054054054058,0.03196752642880728,0.00054054054054058,0.00054054054054058,0.00054054054054058,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0

51458,1,"Outstanding glimpse into the lives of undocumented Mexicans Written all the way back in the mid-1980s , long before all the heated rhetoric about illegal immigration going on in the US today , this book has turned out to be amazingly prescient . I feel like I would have had a much better understanding of this subject ( not to mention appreciation of the people involved ) had I discovered it a long time ago , but I suppose late is better than never . Ted Conover did what I do n't imagine very many other Americans would have the courage to do : Cross illegally from Mexico into the US with Mexicans doing the same thing . In doing so , he gives readers incredible insight into what compels some Mexicans to make that journey ( i.e what life is like where they come from ) , what the journey is like , and what awaits them on this side of the border . I found myself exceedingly grateful for having been born American and simply in awe of the Mexicans who live such vastly disparate lives from their privileged neighbors to the north . Conover simply relates his experiences to readers without the kind of ideological commentary or other editorializing that can get in the way of the facts surrounding the contentious issues involved . Coyotes is a well - written , touching , informative , and inspiring book that should be required reading for all Americans before they open their mouths about illegal immigration",257,1,0.1352973894116933,0.000500000000000031,0.000500000000000031,0.000500000000000031,0.000500000000000031,0.000500000000000031,0.000500000000000031,0.43808798346071853,0.000500000000000031,0.000500000000000031,0.000500000000000031,0.000500000000000031,0.000500000000000031,0.000500000000000031,0.000500000000000031,0.000500000000000031,0.000500000000000031,0.000500000000000031,0.000500000000000031,0.000500000000000031,0.000500000000000031,0.000500000000000031,0.000500000000000031,0.000500000000000031,0.000500000000000031,0.000500000000000031,0.000500000000000031,0.000500000000000031,0.000500000000000031,0.000500000000000031,0.000500000000000031,0.02711291158637936,0.000500000000000031,0.000500000000000031,0.000500000000000031,0.000500000000000031,0.18305189530487623,0.000500000000000031,0.000500000000000031,0.000500000000000031,0.039631754319991566,0.000500000000000031,0.000500000000000031,0.000500000000000031,0.15481806591633956,0.000500000000000031,0.000500000000000031,0.000500000000000031,0.000500000000000031,0.000500000000000031,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

Writing unabashedly in the tradition of unrhymed Homeric epic verse , Mitlon was working well within what was earlier purveyed by Homer , Virgil , and Dante -- but he brings his own distinctive touch and flair to the work . The opening lines of the long poem are clearly inspired by Homer , as are other elements , but Milton has a very unique poetic style ; long sentences , often with the principle verb at the end , being one of its mainstays . This language is very grandiose and quite complex ; it takes a while to get used to it -- you will have to pay very close attention during the first book -- but , as with most classical literature , once the reader gets the hang of it , it goes quite smoothly . The Divine Comedy of Dante has a more towring reputation than does Milton 's Paradise Lost -- for one thing , it is older -- but I among those who find Milton to be superior . The Divine Comedy is , certainly , an undisputed masterpiece , but , where it was , more or less , a satire and a thinly - veiled attack on many of Dante 's political enemies , Milton 's work deals with much more complex and profound subject matter : why mankind fell , how the gods themselves operate and think , the nature and attractiveness of evil and sin , the importance of love in human relationships , the moral problems of God 's justice . It is true that Dante 's work is more original ; Paradise Lost and Paradise Regained , at least in seed , come straight from The Bible . But Milton only uses these stories as a springboard for the exploration of the latent moral and ethical problems lurking beneath . Milton explores these problems with a refreshingly fresh perspective -- strictly within the Christian tradition , to be sure , but far from fundamentalist , and even quite radical for its day . Although some cite the work as Christian apologist , there are certainly many elements within the poem that many of the more hard - line Christians would be taken aback by ; it was , of course , even more controversial in its day . One thing about the work that often gets pointed out is that Satan is a far more interesting and appealing character than God . This , in my view , does not have Milton unwittingly on the Devil 's side , as some critics have suggested . Rather , he is pointing out how appealing sin is always is : of course it 's interesting , of course it 's appealing -- otherwise , we would n't keep falling for it again and again and again . If we saw its razor - sharp fangs and [ dripping ] mouth , we would have stopped getting ensnared in its trap long ago . However , as a non - Christian myself , I can not but disagree with some points of Milton 's theodicy ; the last two books , in particular , and Paradise Regained as a whole , were , for me , quite hard to swallow . I found the more human elements of the poem to be its most intriguing . Milton paints Adam and Eve as quintissentially human characters who possess many of the same feelings that we all share : joy , happiness , fear , sadness , depression , and , most of all , the overriding paramount importance of love . The act of Adam , who was not himself [ evil ] , eating of the apple so that he could follow Eve , no matter what doom was to befall her and them , out of love for her , is still one of the most touching moments in all of literature -- as Mark Twain , in the voice of Adam , later said , "" Wheresoever Eve was there , THERE was Eden . "" God , Satan , and the various angels are also endowed with human characteristics ; most Christians today seem to have forgotten that God created Man "" in His own image "" , and that He is not a perfect creature . Likewise , Satan is not entirely evil -- certainly he is ambitious and narcissistic , but so are many humans -- indeed , many have seen him as the hero of the poem ( an errorenous view , as I see it . ) God often comes off as extremely cold and hardly forgiving or merciful ; indeed , to many readers , myself included , this poem does n't come anywhere near its stated goal of justifying the ways of Gods to men , but only reinforces the views we already had ( Mark Twain , whom I have previously mentioned , has a very different view of the situation , closer to my own perspective , that is worth seeking out . ) Whatever one 's objections to the theology and theodicy expressed within the poem , the poem remains a great work of literature -- poetic , grandiose , profound , extremely readable , and thought - provoking . The shorter sequel , Paradise Regained , is also included in this edition . This work , in my view , comes nowhere near the glory of it 's predecessor , but it is still a good read and it is very handy to have it included in this volume as well . For that reason , I highly reccommend picking up this particular edition of the works ; also because the introduction , written by Dr. Susanne Woods , is very good , and it has notes provided by the wonderful Christoper Ricks , who also edited the poem for this version . Unlike many editors , he does not include so many notes that they become cumbersome and distract from the text : they are genuinely helpful and there are not too many of them . This is an absolute classic not only of English literature , but of world literature , and a monument in the tradition of epic poetry that you owe it to yourself to read",1109,1,0.00014814814814816463,0.06831253951964701,0.00014814814814816463,0.00014814814814816463,0.00014814814814816463,0.00014814814814816463,0.00014814814814816463,0.2804910954585024,0.02496507847813279,0.00014814814814816463,0.00014814814814816463,0.022380834409991557,0.00014814814814816463,0.00014814814814816463,0.00014814814814816463,0.00014814814814816463,0.022873385478595642,0.00014814814814816463,0.00014814814814816463,0.00014814814814816463,0.06184633648571113,0.00014814814814816463,0.00014814814814816463,0.00014814814814816463,0.00014814814814816463,0.00014814814814816463,0.037096209369920384,0.00014814814814816463,0.00014814814814816463,0.00014814814814816463,0.00014814814814816463,0.00014814814814816463,0.052132523770430816,0.00014814814814816463,0.09967536237308365,0.00014814814814816463,0.1080767218525158,0.03881591435971696,0.08876740554792777,0.00014814814814816463,0.07006602578863841,0.00014814814814816463,0.019167233773851464,0.00014814814814816463,0.00014814814814816463,0.00014814814814816463,0.00014814814814816463,0.00014814814814816463,0.00014814814814816463,0.00014814814814816463,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

51505,1,"A work that is compassionately direct yet psychologically and spiritually humane . For most of us , the area of thanatology is something quite new , despite the fact that death is such an intimate "" companion "" that can come at any moment of our lives , whether by degrees or instantaneously , irrelevant of our ethnic , social and economic backgrounds . It is a plain truth that can not be avoided , and no technological advancements can make it go away . I would personally like to consider death as the ultimate best friend who would never desert you , despite what your feelings may be . And as a child has the innocent ablity to humanize a doll or a toy soldier , the adult must equally do so with death , not shy away from it and be totally uncommunicative to what it means : the total cessation of physical life , for if one denys its existence and its inevitability , the person could not only suffer from added unnecessary physical heartache , but he or she could also augment the physical stress with mental , spiritual and religious grief as well . Submission to and acceptance of the truth , no matter how difficult it would be to hear , could be the highest catharsis that medicine could not come close to healing . In Elizabeth Kubler - Ross 's classic study of the dying process , she interviews patients of various age brackets who teach the living what dying means to them . But even though the experience is individualistic to that specific person , the process of dying has a universality to it which connects us all . Hence , how do you take the sting from the wound ? In On Death and Dying , you remove the sting by communication and by simply being there to let the patient say what he or she has to say , to let them vent , and at their own pace , go through the classic defined stages of the dying process : denial and isolation , anger , bargaining , depression and acceptance . The patients become our teachers . We learn of their fears , their possible financial burdens , in one woman 's case , the fear of the worms , et cetera . But we also learn about what the families go through , their own anger and disbelief and guilt . It is about pacing and the opening up of repressed fear for all the people involved . Sometimes there is cohesion in the shock and anger , other times not . The United States is one of the most death - denying countries out there , a fact most evident with plastic surgery on the rise and chiseled bodies to reverse the aging process , for going foward means only one thing : death . Ross 's overall message is that death does not have to be and is not the horror that we all think it is , the grim reaper with the skeletal hand and the sharpened scythe . Death has issues for everybody , doctors , faith - filled people , even Ross heself . It is a step that we are all going to take sooner or later . But it is comforting to know that we are all in it together .",571,1,0.0002985074626866016,0.2005533683151807,0.0002985074626866016,0.0002985074626866016,0.0002985074626866016,0.0002985074626866016,0.0002985074626866016,0.37594761201419274,0.0002985074626866016,0.0002985074626866016,0.0002985074626866016,0.0002985074626866016,0.0002985074626866016,0.0002985074626866016,0.0002985074626866016,0.0002985074626866016,0.0002985074626866016,0.0002985074626866016,0.0002985074626866016,0.0002985074626866016,0.0002985074626866016,0.0002985074626866016,0.0002985074626866016,0.0002985074626866016,0.0002985074626866016,0.0002985074626866016,0.055981867559576515,0.0002985074626866016,0.0002985074626866016,0.0002985074626866016,0.0002985074626866016,0.0002985074626866016,0.0002985074626866016,0.0002985074626866016,0.0002985074626866016,0.013124758455260855,0.0002985074626866016,0.0002985074626866016,0.0002985074626866016,0.03635359522116795,0.0002985074626866016,0.012604814596614618,0.0002985074626866016,0.07509623154939819,0.15803030395720388,0.060068642361253956,0.0002985074626866016,0.0002985074626866016,0.0002985074626866016,0.0002985074626866016,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0

51520,1,"Indispensable resource This is a reader that covers the various theories of nationalism as well as varieties of nationalism itself . This makes it a largely indispensable supplement , handbook and reference work for anyone interested in nationalism . This is particularly true today as the scholarship on this social phenomenon continues to grow unabated , and since it is patently obvious that nationalism hardly seems about to disappear . The reader contains important extracts from the major works on nationalism by some of the most important early theorists such as Renan , Max Weber and Stalin ( although the views of Marx and Engels themselves or Lord Acton and Friedrich Meinecke would have been welcome additions ) and almost all of the most important contemporary scholars ( Gellner , Anderson , Connor , A. Smith , etc . ) .

It should be required reading in colleges and for those in all levels of government , Wall Street and industry CEOs . The writing is excellent . Many of its passages read like prayers . I ca n't think of topics and subjects more important than those Jensen writes about -- our cultures diconnection from the natural world and from ourselves and how it has impacted our mental and spiritual health and the health of the earth . Jensen is so passionate about these topics that he does repeat certain ideas , BUT instead of ruining it , I think the non - linear trajectory of his book actually enhances his message . The first half of the book where he discusses problems can be hard - hitting and difficult to get through certain parts of it , BUT please hold fast through the end . It is worth it .

Most of the examples presented in the book are written in Eiffel , an object oriented language that fully supports preconditions , postconditions and invariants without need for preprocessing . If you have n't written code in Eiffel I highly recommend that you download EiffelStudio and deploy the examples in this book . Although there are tools that offer assertion facilities , none provide the ease of use as that seen in the Eiffel language . The text covers a preprocessor that imparts assertions to Java , but the extra steps and unique keywords required to incorporate and activate the assertions are likely to prevent wide scale use of the tool in a software development environment . Some aspects of object oriented languages such as design by contract and multiple inheritance are often taught through a language and an integrated developer 's environment that minimally supports the functionality . As such developers form a poor opinion of the concept and not the tool . The keyword support of contracts in Eiffel makes the language a perfect learning tool which will impart a more than academic understanding of the value of assertions . The authors state ardently that developers have a choice between spending hours hunting down the causes of runtime errors or instead allocating time to write thorough contracts . As a sometimes Eiffel developer I can state that this assertion is accurate . Since contracts also assign responsibility for the runtime errors , they are invaluable for debugging . I recall an instance when I encountered a postcondition violation while using a linked list from the Eiffel library . As a client of the class , I did n't spend any time tracking down the source of the error other than to report it along with the condition that triggered the error to the supplier . In industry significant time is spent debugging code prior to delivery and maintaining code afterwards . Any concept or tool that aids in this function is indispensable to the project . Apparently many people understood this notion since for several years the proposal to broaden Java to include keyword support of programming by contract was purportedly the most frequent "" non - bug "" report requested by Java developers . The book is well organized providing a set of step by step instructions on how to write robust contracts applicable to a wide range of examples from simple data structures to more advanced cases such as the implementation of the Observer Pattern . I considered myself well versed in design by contract but the six principles and guidelines as well as the frame rules , introduced successively via examples , provided a more rigorous approach to developing contracts than I had employed in the past . In Chapter 2 , the distinction between basic and derived queries is discussed and all six principles are introduced through a stack example . Each principle is unveiled in conjunction with designing methods and their contracts for the data structure . In the development of the dictionary class in Chapter 3 , the authors present a case for a new query which asks if the dictionary already contains a specific key . The query arises from the specific application of the principles pertaining to postconditions . This is an excellent example of how contracts result in the development of new and needed features in a class . In Chapter 6 , the authors present a clear rational for weakening inherited preconditions and strengthening postconditions and invariants in accordance with other literature pertaining to the same topic . In particular , the example of a delivery service reads like a case of retail agreement in plain language but is complemented by examples of code and UML diagrams . The concept of guarding postconditions with preconditions to facilitate possible redefinition of methods is also introduced and well explained . Chapter 8 covers the benefits of design by contract and if the reader has compiled and executed the examples presented in the book , they will have experienced some of these benefits firsthand . Of course there are considerations like better documentation and more reliable code , but the debugging assistance is the most overt benefit of contracts . The stack traces associated with assertion exceptions are an invaluable tool during both development and maintenance . Anyone who has developed quality software under a tight schedule understands the benefits of precision bug identification and resolution . Analysis by contract , introduced in the final chapter , presents the concepts of design by contract abstractly removed from the code specifics . The authors present an analysis of a person withdrawing money from a bank . In doing so they codify the sequence of events based on the contract stating that the design is "" derived from the specification rather than being a design that is also being used as a specification . "" The obvious implication of this is that the final product will likely fulfill the specification implicitly . This is a book packed with knowledge that is essential for all developers regardless of the current support of design by contract in conventional languages . In the future , as the more popular languages incorporate additional design by contract concepts , there will be an increased number of authors producing texts on these topics as well as a growing number of developers annotating their resumes accordingly . I suspect that all of these texts will reference Design by Contract by Example and many of the developers that already understand the concept will be well acquainted with the pages of this book .",1021,1,0.00020833333333335153,0.00020833333333335153,0.036717336293211965,0.024229291062431737,0.00020833333333335153,0.010901901204632362,0.00020833333333335153,0.00020833333333335153,0.15005327435530919,0.00020833333333335153,0.009338286339446908,0.023418426119106085,0.00020833333333335153,0.00020833333333335153,0.00020833333333335153,0.00020833333333335153,0.00020833333333335153,0.00020833333333335153,0.00020833333333335153,0.00020833333333335153,0.00020833333333335153,0.00020833333333335153,0.07391322962429503,0.00020833333333335153,0.00020833333333335153,0.012122510854190556,0.00020833333333335153,0.00020833333333335153,0.00020833333333335153,0.03638921937781398,0.00020833333333335153,0.00020833333333335153,0.00020833333333335153,0.00020833333333335153,0.01821822283936785,0.00020833333333335153,0.29761756118151483,0.059365823512868635,0.04142895283233696,0.031118471448308118,0.01748043374102606,0.00020833333333335153,0.00020833333333335153,0.00020833333333335153,0.02522436224213955,0.09278534055187905,0.03301068975345423,0.00020833333333335153,0.00020833333333335153,0.00020833333333335153,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0

51554,1,"Dorm Room Diet - Solid Lifestyle Approach for All Really Oz talks sense . From the first chaper , I was hooked . She suggested making a minor change for the first week . I cut back on one soft drink per day - from 3 down to 2 . That was quite painless . I also took her starter tips - drink water before meals and do n't eat closer than 2 hours before bedtime . Again , those were minor and did n't crimp my style . This is not really a diet book though it deals with diet ( as in what you eat ) . It 's really about living well and making mostly good choices but not going overboard ( and ultimately failing ) . Oz is a vegetarian , but she said that red meat was fine in moderation . Go for only twice per week on that she suggested . I love beef , but I also like chicken and fish and can tweak that part of my meal plan . Chips are junk food , but a bowl is n't a huge deal . Just do n't grab the bag and keep munching . If you have an urge for chocolate , melt some semi - sweet chocolate and dip fruits like strawberries in the chocolate . It really does satisfy that chocolate craving with smaller amounts of chocolate . That 's typical of her advice and things that I can handle and maintain . She also talks about exercise and about supplements ( meant to supplement and not take the place of good food ) . She 's reasonable with her ideas here as well . I added some extra work out time ( even jogging 5 minutes while watching TV adds up if you do it pretty often ) and bought a basic vitamin plus B , C and E ( all heartily approved by my doc ) . Oz lost 10 pounds her first semester . This is not a crash course . She 's down 30 lbs now ( over 2 years I think ) - just slowly and surely . And , she 's maintained rather than yo - yo'ing . I think most people ( college or not ) would benefit from reading this book and trying out Oz 's common sense plan . Older readers might need a little less food overall and might not opt to go out and have a snowball fight to burn calories , but the basics are here for a good lifestyle plan that is n't painful and does work . This would be a great book for anyone ( females more so ) headed off to college or in college . Oz has dealt with being overweight . She did a lot of research and put a workable plan into action . I think most readers will love her style and also will be able to use her ideas and stay slimmer and healthier .",506,1,0.24153383273600712,0.11055553400446459,0.0002597402597402814,0.07750664431711432,0.034894855609786585,0.030812304444549424,0.0002597402597402814,0.0002597402597402814,0.0002597402597402814,0.0002597402597402814,0.0002597402597402814,0.0002597402597402814,0.0002597402597402814,0.0002597402597402814,0.0002597402597402814,0.0002597402597402814,0.05743993227220258,0.0002597402597402814,0.026233457415629408,0.0002597402597402814,0.0002597402597402814,0.1424304703963859,0.0002597402597402814,0.017611148360947973,0.0002597402597402814,0.0519598644250105,0.0002597402597402814,0.0002597402597402814,0.0002597402597402814,0.0002597402597402814,0.0002597402597402814,0.0002597402597402814,0.0002597402597402814,0.0002597402597402814,0.0002597402597402814,0.0002597402597402814,0.08806002098233205,0.0002597402597402814,0.04120648950348791,0.0002597402597402814,0.039881937850957214,0.0002597402597402814,0.015636795298752462,0.0002597402597402814,0.0002597402597402814,0.0002597402597402814,0.01514580329146227,0.0002597402597402814,0.0002597402597402814,0.0002597402597402814,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

51589,1,"Excellent resource for an Italian cookbook library This review is written from the perspective of a serious home cook that has been studying cooking for 25 years and concentrating on Italian cooking for the last 10 years . This book is targeted to anyone that wants to learn the history of Italian cooking . This book is full of both information and recipes . This was one of my first Italian cookbooks , and is still one of my favorites . This book is an authentic Italian cookbook not the Italian - American type that we are accustomed to in the USA . If you want a good comprehensive book on authentic Italian food this is one of the books that I would recommend . However , if you are a beginner Italian cook , this is not the book for you . The directions are written for someone that is familiar with the Italian kitchen . The author assumes you have a basic knowledge of the Italian kitchen and typical recipes . One complaint , and it is minor , is the lack of glossy photographs that I have become so accustomed to in cookbooks . The recipes in this book more than make up for the lack of photographs . Overall this book is highly recommended for those that are serious about Italian cooking",226,1,0.03635532133544206,0.11525674992063929,0.00050000000000004,0.02549999298725308,0.00050000000000004,0.00050000000000004,0.00050000000000004,0.00050000000000004,0.00050000000000004,0.00050000000000004,0.00050000000000004,0.07187036633115958,0.00050000000000004,0.00050000000000004,0.00050000000000004,0.00050000000000004,0.00050000000000004,0.00050000000000004,0.00050000000000004,0.05565849662209141,0.00050000000000004,0.00050000000000004,0.00050000000000004,0.00050000000000004,0.00050000000000004,0.00050000000000004,0.00050000000000004,0.00050000000000004,0.00050000000000004,0.00050000000000004,0.00050000000000004,0.049799856539539486,0.00050000000000004,0.00050000000000004,0.00050000000000004,0.00050000000000004,0.41866860972165365,0.00050000000000004,0.03052328526018904,0.00050000000000004,0.06341557650563127,0.00050000000000004,0.00050000000000004,0.00050000000000004,0.04351652730473473,0.06993521747166481,0.00050000000000004,0.00050000000000004,0.00050000000000004,0.00050000000000004,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0

51600,1,Better than the previous Editions I bought this book because it was required for a class I am taking . I had the 3rd Edition already and was n't too impressed . But this 5th Edition is much more appealing . I just became PMP certified and reviewing this book before taking the exam was a great primer to get my head out of pure PMBOK and into real world Project Management . The case studies and Directed Readings are great for seeing real world PM activities . I would suggest the book for guidance and classroom type learning . If you 're an experienced PM then this book is too academic and wo n't feed your intellect .

51602,1,"A READABLE , ENGAGING CLASSIC This book is more dated than THE SECRET GARDEN , but it 's still a great story . It 's hard NOT to identify with Sara Crewe . I loved this book as a child ( though not as much as I loved THE SECRET GARDEN , which I think is a better book ) . However , A LITTLE PRINCESS may appeal more to some people ; some readers may find the story stronger and the main character , Sara Crewe , more likable . Sara 's determination to stay herself despite how other people treat her and view her is inspiring and may help readers through tough times of their own . Some scenes ( I do n't want to spoil the surprise by describing them ) are magical . A LITTLE PRINCESS is a great story that makes readers think . Some of those thoughts make you uncomfortable , like the thoughts about differences between rich and poor children - but that ( I think ) is part of the book 's greatness . Be sure to get an unabridged edition : this book is beautifully written and should not be simplified . Kids now CAN read and will love this book : at least , every girl to whom I have given a copy has read it and reread it -- on her own . For a modern , well - written book about another girl at an English boarding school , read Libby Koponen 's BLOW OUT THE MOON . It has the same classic feel , though American heroine is very different from Sara in some ways ( though she too is determined to hang onto her identity ) and MOON is quite funny",295,1,0.00032786885245904453,0.0390144043611407,0.012503296954241301,0.00032786885245904453,0.03254003525000975,0.049786663888678126,0.00032786885245904453,0.00032786885245904453,0.00032786885245904453,0.00032786885245904453,0.00032786885245904453,0.00032786885245904453,0.00032786885245904453,0.00032786885245904453,0.00032786885245904453,0.00032786885245904453,0.00032786885245904453,0.00032786885245904453,0.00032786885245904453,0.00032786885245904453,0.1870914525080232,0.00032786885245904453,0.00032786885245904453,0.00032786885245904453,0.051666873869990804,0.019034081485074555,0.021154329499793408,0.00032786885245904453,0.00032786885245904453,0.00032786885245904453,0.00032786885245904453,0.021094509237129723,0.00032786885245904453,0.00032786885245904453,0.1347574795518186,0.00032786885245904453,0.3825208929651073,0.019995415295694808,0.00032786885245904453,0.00032786885245904453,0.00032786885245904453,0.01670941759231306,0.00032786885245904453,0.00032786885245904453,0.00032786885245904453,0.00032786885245904453,0.00032786885245904453,0.00032786885245904453,0.00032786885245904453,0.00032786885245904453,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The only thing I really want to say is that I really , really liked Muriel and Edward , the dog .",70,1,0.0011111111111111562,0.0011111111111111562,0.0011111111111111562,0.0011111111111111562,0.0011111111111111562,0.0011111111111111562,0.0011111111111111562,0.0011111111111111562,0.0011111111111111562,0.0011111111111111562,0.0011111111111111562,0.0011111111111111562,0.0011111111111111562,0.0011111111111111562,0.0011111111111111562,0.0011111111111111562,0.0011111111111111562,0.0011111111111111562,0.0011111111111111562,0.0011111111111111562,0.0011111111111111562,0.2434702056354325,0.0011111111111111562,0.0011111111111111562,0.0011111111111111562,0.0011111111111111562,0.0011111111111111562,0.0011111111111111562,0.0011111111111111562,0.0011111111111111562,0.0011111111111111562,0.0011111111111111562,0.0011111111111111562,0.0011111111111111562,0.13678831169339073,0.0011111111111111562,0.08414224505309072,0.0011111111111111562,0.32912556839963003,0.0011111111111111562,0.0011111111111111562,0.0011111111111111562,0.0011111111111111562,0.0011111111111111562,0.15647366921845415,0.0011111111111111562,0.0011111111111111562,0.0011111111111111562,0.0011111111111111562,0.0011111111111111562,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1

51614,1,"what happened in the Middle ? ? ? I just finished reading the Hitorian . The first 400 pages were so compelling , that I could hardly put it down . Then ..... it became soooo boring . It literally took me the same amount of time to get through the next 200 pages as the first 400 . I just had to keep putting it down and shaking my head , thinking this has to get better , considering how good the first 2/3rd 's were . I also have to say that I was disappointed with the ending - it was way too contrived for me ... SPOILER ALERT * * * - I found it EXTREMELY unbelievable that Dracula would ' assume ' that Helen died in the fall and not gone after her , as the author states when Helen is recounting how she made it out alive from the fall . I mean , come on ... Dracula is supposedly all knowing and has tracked this woman all over the world . Now were supposed to believe that he simply says "" damn , she fell - I guess after all I 've been through , I wo n't bother to check - I 'll just find another victim "" - sorry , did n't buy it and it really was a big let down after so much potential in the beginning .. Overall , the book was really great . Fascinating reading for the Dracula fan . Just wish the ending held up to the beginning .",263,1,0.13193501039440847,0.0004000000000000391,0.0004000000000000391,0.0004000000000000391,0.021812419037936428,0.02110482488728143,0.0004000000000000391,0.0004000000000000391,0.0004000000000000391,0.0004000000000000391,0.0004000000000000391,0.0004000000000000391,0.26949613334735945,0.0004000000000000391,0.0004000000000000391,0.0004000000000000391,0.0004000000000000391,0.02971468927739189,0.0004000000000000391,0.0004000000000000391,0.0004000000000000391,0.1980584838457732,0.0004000000000000391,0.02393583370675853,0.0004000000000000391,0.0004000000000000391,0.0004000000000000391,0.0004000000000000391,0.0004000000000000391,0.0004000000000000391,0.0004000000000000391,0.0004000000000000391,0.0004000000000000391,0.0004000000000000391,0.0004000000000000391,0.020802830700075794,0.2426758325614659,0.0004000000000000391,0.0004000000000000391,0.024463942241547333,0.0004000000000000391,0.0004000000000000391,0.0004000000000000391,0.0004000000000000391,0.0004000000000000391,0.0004000000000000391,0.0004000000000000391,0.0004000000000000391,0.0004000000000000391,0.0004000000000000391,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
51615,1,"Missing person Wendell Jaffe swindled a lot of people out of money and then conveniently disappeared from his boat . The verdict was suicide , but the insurance company that had sold him a half - million dollar insurance policy is not convinced . When 5 years passed , the company was forced to pay the premium to Jaffe 's wife . Two months later , a man looking very much like Jaffe is spotted in Mexico . The insurance company hires private investigator Kinsey Millhone to investigate and she does spot a man who appears to be Jaffe , along with his girlfriend Renata . They escape Kinsey 's surveillance and she returns to California . Jaffe 's son Brian is in big trouble with the police and Kinsey concludes that Jaffe will return to help his son . As she continues her investigation she becomes acquainted with Jaffe 's supposed widow and his two troubled sons . She also comes in contact with some of her long - lost family , and agonizes over whether she wants to establish a relationship with them , and open up old wounds . Sue Grafton can be relied on to provide a good read , and this book , although not the best in the series , is no exception",219,1,0.000540540540540577,0.000540540540540577,0.000540540540540577,0.000540540540540577,0.000540540540540577,0.000540540540540577,0.000540540540540577,0.15274493470255465,0.000540540540540577,0.000540540540540577,0.000540540540540577,0.000540540540540577,0.000540540540540577,0.000540540540540577,0.027567567567349505,0.000540540540540577,0.000540540540540577,0.000540540540540577,0.000540540540540577,0.000540540540540577,0.000540540540540577,0.000540540540540577,0.000540540540540577,0.04441176350706373,0.000540540540540577,0.000540540540540577,0.09380741594908087,0.000540540540540577,0.000540540540540577,0.03285080500796308,0.000540540540540577,0.000540540540540577,0.000540540540540577,0.000540540540540577,0.000540540540540577,0.000540540540540577,0.10285050815335882,0.000540540540540577,0.000540540540540577,0.050285194439802276,0.0762648939940198,0.05805925543032634,0.05025868116356819,0.000540540540540577,0.000540540540540577,0.28981789900383015,0.000540540540540577,0.000540540540540577,0.000540540540540577,0.000540540540540577,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
51618,1,"All around good , easy read I started the book last night , and could n't put it down until 4 am , but at least I finished it ! It was a good storyline , I enjoyed getting a simple glimpse into the media world . It also gives you a good peek into the corruption behind campaigns and politics in general . I really liked the characters in this book , although each one , in my opinion , could have used some more depth . The only reason this book does n't get 5 stars is because as you read it - you start to feel that the second half of the book lt;with extra emphasis on the last quarter of the book gt ; was completely RUSHED . I really do n't like a sudden closing to a book . However , it really does keep you guessing until the last couple of pages . I just feel that it could have had MORE of an impact , and MORE of that quot;UMPH quot ; had the story been written at the same speed throughout . I do recommend this book for anyone who just wants a good book to read . If you 're looking for something you will remember for life - this is n't going to be it . But if you 're looking for a pleasant way to spend a nice afternoon - - - by all means , try reading Mary Jane Clark 's quot;Do You ... etc . quot ; Final word : I believe her mother - in - law , the OTHER Clark , would be quite proud of her ex - daughter in law . The woman can write . However , given her talents , I wish she would learn to write in her own style , instead of in the familiar style of the OTHER Clark",321,1,0.00025641025641028113,0.024520433855218543,0.00025641025641028113,0.00025641025641028113,0.00025641025641028113,0.00025641025641028113,0.00025641025641028113,0.08584625267491552,0.00025641025641028113,0.00025641025641028113,0.00025641025641028113,0.00025641025641028113,0.00025641025641028113,0.00025641025641028113,0.013076922906062959,0.00025641025641028113,0.09441952922527859,0.00025641025641028113,0.00025641025641028113,0.00025641025641028113,0.00025641025641028113,0.09973318108163452,0.00025641025641028113,0.00025641025641028113,0.00025641025641028113,0.00025641025641028113,0.00025641025641028113,0.00025641025641028113,0.00025641025641028113,0.00025641025641028113,0.00025641025641028113,0.00025641025641028113,0.00025641025641028113,0.00025641025641028113,0.00025641025641028113,0.014561545520853524,0.43726078510647814,0.05277882509944643,0.00025641025641028113,0.018361682620481753,0.00025641025641028113,0.02932908392322135,0.00025641025641028113,0.00025641025641028113,0.09939817372616734,0.00025641025641028113,0.020969994516650794,0.00025641025641028113,0.00025641025641028113,0.00025641025641028113,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0
51625,1,"Beautiful and Practical This is not the book for you if you 're impatient with precision and specifics ; if you want good results , you 'll do what Michael Recchiuti tells you to do . You 'll buy the higher - butterfat butter , you 'll use the Scharffen - Berger or Valrhona and chuck the Hershey 's , and you 'll be so glad you did , because every recipe --and I mean every single one of the seven or eight recipes I have tried from this book thus far-- has been fantastic . I would not call this a good beginner 's cookbook , though the photography is gorgeous enough to qualify this as a coffee table book even for those who do n't want to get in the kitchen . Some baking experience is helpful , as is a well - equipped kitchen ( stand - mixer , immersion blender , heavy - bottomed pots for sauces etc ) . This is an outstanding book and I highly recommend it .",175,1,0.04811745491481585,0.000689655172413841,0.000689655172413841,0.000689655172413841,0.000689655172413841,0.000689655172413841,0.000689655172413841,0.000689655172413841,0.03246622959219431,0.000689655172413841,0.000689655172413841,0.06552193248988834,0.07004541291713387,0.000689655172413841,0.000689655172413841,0.000689655172413841,0.09629241411416158,0.043468076149360185,0.000689655172413841,0.11197066038813223,0.000689655172413841,0.000689655172413841,0.000689655172413841,0.000689655172413841,0.000689655172413841,0.000689655172413841,0.000689655172413841,0.000689655172413841,0.000689655172413841,0.000689655172413841,0.000689655172413841,0.000689655172413841,0.04283269518494503,0.000689655172413841,0.000689655172413841,0.000689655172413841,0.17528509962887845,0.000689655172413841,0.000689655172413841,0.000689655172413841,0.000689655172413841,0.000689655172413841,0.000689655172413841,0.000689655172413841,0.28641381772393665,0.000689655172413841,0.000689655172413841,0.000689655172413841,0.000689655172413841,0.000689655172413841,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

51642,1,"Using this book at UNC Charlotte in class All right ... All right , I say . So I 'm writing about a preteen book about a little girl . That does n't make me weird does it ? It should n't since I had to read it for a college course . So I 'm writing because , well , who would 've ever guessed , but I loved it ? It 's a ripping story , man . It is funny , inventive , historic and riveting , all the things I was sure it would n't be when I got assigned the book . So , here I am , blown away by a book about a little girl . I do n't even like history , but it was n't presented as antiquated . It was dealt with as you and I would deal with our history , as pertinent , in the moment , and nothing that has been generated and worked over in a history book . I 'm telling you , the character Darby is great , as are all the characters , including the total garps that go around spouting their racist jargon , etc , until Darby unintentionally questions everything , causing all matter of problems , like maybe she 'll get knocked off by the Klan . The story is actually something you 'll find yourself absolutely focused on . I could n't put it down . I 've read a lot of adolescent fiction for this class , and I can say that if I had a kid , I 'd be pouring this down their brain . So , does that make me weird ? Who cares , huh ?

51646,1,"Contentment I too have stood at the dessert table of a buffet hopelessly unable to eat as many servings as I wanted . This is a perfect metaphor for the book "" When All You 've Ever Wanted Is n't Enough "" . The book is about the spiritual yearning you feel inside , that always seems to want something more . Until they arrive at that "" something more "" , people can never truly feel content . As is the case with most of Kushner 's writing , he uses a book of the old testament to further his explanation . In this case , he effectively employs the seemingly paradoxical book of Ecclesiastes . This book of the Bible finds its author searching for more in life . In the end , the author finds that it is not so much the end as the journey itself that has importance . Kushner 's overall point is best summarized on page 189 . Does it make a difference if I am honest , good , or faithful ? It does not seem to matter to my bank account or fortune . "" ... It matters if we are true to ourselves , to our innate human nature that requires things like honesty and kindness and grows flabby and distorted if we neglect them . It matters if we learn how to share our lives with others , making them and their world different , rather than try and hoard life to ourselves . It matters than we learn to recognize the pleasures of every day , food and work and love and friendship , as encounters with the divine , encounters that teach us not only that God is real but that we are real too . "" It is a simple yet beautiful message . People that live this message will certainly discover the beauty in their life",321,1,0.1385005190559174,0.0003333333333333584,0.0003333333333333584,0.0003333333333333584,0.0003333333333333584,0.0003333333333333584,0.0003333333333333584,0.27373652202414955,0.0003333333333333584,0.0003333333333333584,0.0003333333333333584,0.0003333333333333584,0.0003333333333333584,0.0003333333333333584,0.0003333333333333584,0.0003333333333333584,0.0003333333333333584,0.0003333333333333584,0.0003333333333333584,0.0003333333333333584,0.0003333333333333584,0.0003333333333333584,0.0003333333333333584,0.0003333333333333584,0.0003333333333333584,0.025156925992743613,0.0003333333333333584,0.0003333333333333584,0.0003333333333333584,0.0003333333333333584,0.0003333333333333584,0.0003333333333333584,0.0003333333333333584,0.0003333333333333584,0.0003333333333333584,0.0003333333333333584,0.26960505181326494,0.0003333333333333584,0.053629889641586846,0.0003333333333333584,0.0003333333333333584,0.0003333333333333584,0.0003333333333333584,0.0003333333333333584,0.07488052379541132,0.15015723434359188,0.0003333333333333584,0.0003333333333333584,0.0003333333333333584,0.0003333333333333584,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0

51672,1,"Western Liberalism on Trial In Faith in Nation , Anthony Marx delivers a spirited rebuttal of the "" literary trope "" ( p 15 ) about a liberal , inclusive Western nationalism . Instead , he argues that even the "" truest "" brand of Western nationalism - that of England and France - came to being only after brutal fratricide of massive scale . His entire theory is based on a central position that nationalism developed much earlier than is popularly believed today . This leads one to question why does he insist on such a position ? Has he made the case for it ? What happens to his theory if the position turns out to be wrong ? I will argue that the definition of the state , or the lack thereof , is key to answering all of the above questions . Only by implicitly loosening the definition of the state , can Marx trace the genesis of Western nationalism back to as early as the 16th century , thus cementing the linkage between Western nationalism and religious violence . However , the liberal adaptation of the concept of the state puts Marx 's entire theory on shaky ground . According to Marx , the state is the raison d ' tat of nationalism : for nationalism to become a historical force , it "" must ... refer to a state as an existing structure or potential object of engagement "" ( p 8) . Although he declares early and clearly what nationalism is ( p 4 ) , he never spells out his definition of a state . In fact , what we would think of as a modern state today can hardly be found in 16th century Europe . Only when the definition of a state is sufficiently loosened , can Marx backdate nationalism to the 16th century , when most of the political authorities at the time existed in the form of royal courts . Only after he pushes back the genesis of nationalism , can Marx connect the religious violence of the 16th century to nationalism . Only when the religious violence is viewed as part of the history of nation building , does it acquire significance in the nature of Western nationalism . Otherwise , the St. Barthelme Day massacre or the burnings at Smithfield is just another "" normal "" religious upheavals in history , thus any association the massacre or the burnings may have with nation building would be purely coincidental - as Liah Greenfeld implied when Marx quoted her in saying , "" Frenchness was disassociating itself from Catholicism . "" To Anthony Marx , however , French nationalism and its French Catholic identity are not external to each other . They are just different stages in the same dialectic process . Therefore , real "" Frenchness "" is actually the public oblivion in France of the strange relationship between the church and the state1 . Yet all the grand reasoning depends on Marx 's definition of the state . After all , can we call the royal courts of the 16th century "" states "" ? Not only has Marx not given his readers a clear answer , some of his own writings seem to contradict each other . For example , Marx mentions that the Treaty of Westphalia marks the beginning of the modern states ( p 35 ) . But the French War of Religions and the reign of Mary Tudor - the very conflicts that are supposedly at the core of nation - state building - occurred almost a century earlier . Even if we use the later date , 1648 , as the beginning of the state system , one still has to be cautious to label all subsequent political authorities "" states "" . Regardless whether Louis XIV actually said "" I am the state "" , the fact that monarchical authority is directly associated with an individual ruler makes it transient in nature ( relative to institutionalized modern government ) , therefore it can hardly be designated the "" object of engagement "" for nationalist ideology . Since Marx 's concept of the state is on shaky ground , his entire theory appears highly questionable . I would argue , however , there are two options that can salvage his arguments . One is to weaken the link between nationalism and the state . In other words , nationalism may develop independent of the state . This observation may have a wider application outside of the context of Western history than inside of it . The other option is to introduce a third element , such as political culture , that can bridge the violent past and state and nation building in later times . For example , one accepts that the massive fratricide did happen earlier than the emergence of the nation - state . Nevertheless , the bloodshed molded a new political culture , which manifested itself as a more inclusive nationalism when the nation - state took shape later . If such an interpretation proves to be a more sensible reading of history than that of Marx , then Marx 's criticism of Western nationalism can be easily appropriated to deconstruct the Western political culture - the liberal democracy - itself : that it has a ugly past but short memory . However , is the world ready for such a "" total recall "" ?",918,1,0.26558811010723,0.00031250000000002825,0.00031250000000002825,0.00031250000000002825,0.00031250000000002825,0.028296855258314664,0.00031250000000002825,0.2300056605687117,0.00031250000000002825,0.00031250000000002825,0.00031250000000002825,0.016199625420182648,0.00031250000000002825,0.00031250000000002825,0.00031250000000002825,0.00031250000000002825,0.00031250000000002825,0.00031250000000002825,0.00031250000000002825,0.00031250000000002825,0.00031250000000002825,0.00031250000000002825,0.00031250000000002825,0.00031250000000002825,0.00031250000000002825,0.00031250000000002825,0.05985639952314225,0.00031250000000002825,0.016272712931721348,0.00031250000000002825,0.00031250000000002825,0.11159978311285532,0.00031250000000002825,0.00031250000000002825,0.00031250000000002825,0.00031250000000002825,0.04276549086883752,0.00031250000000002825,0.071538129628724,0.00031250000000002825,0.00031250000000002825,0.00031250000000002825,0.00031250000000002825,0.00031250000000002825,0.00031250000000002825,0.12904757848532378,0.01664215409495571,0.00031250000000002825,0.00031250000000002825,0.00031250000000002825,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0

There is no book that has everything , every name , every movie star , if so , it costs 500.00 or the book weighs about 10 pounds .

It works well with other book sources , to check , and maybe another source will prove it wrong , or "" Who 's Who "" proves the other book wrong , when double checking . I did n't find loads of errors in here , a few , the biggest problem ( as others mentioned ) is very brief or not complete career lists , movies or TV they did is not complete .

51685,1,"an excellent survey of the impact of railway travel In the last few decades historians --following sociologists such as Durkheim-- have turned their attention to the ways in which new technologies have altered people 's experience of space and time . Schivelbusch 's small piece is a pretty good ( but light - weight ) example of this genre . He reveals some interesting trivia along the way : he tells , for example , how padded upolstery was invented to assuage the fears of first - class passengers brought about by the roughness of new speed ; he shows that compartment design in passenger cars reflect the contrasting social values of Europe and America . But he is at his most interesting when describing the ways in which the railroad created new conceptual forms of geographical distance by obliterating the spaces in between destinations . Furthermore , by creating the need for standardized time - tables , railways nurtured a standardized / homogenized conception of time . Local idiocyncracies became less important . Doubtless true national identities could never have emerged without revolutions in transportation and communications . A book that takes these ideas much further is Stephen Kern 's excellent work quot;The Culture of Time and Space . quot ; If this genre interests you , Kern 's book is an important read",225,1,0.000512820512820544,0.2994805321265932,0.000512820512820544,0.000512820512820544,0.05939170342188454,0.000512820512820544,0.000512820512820544,0.000512820512820544,0.05802099312928483,0.000512820512820544,0.000512820512820544,0.000512820512820544,0.000512820512820544,0.000512820512820544,0.026153831321565988,0.000512820512820544,0.000512820512820544,0.000512820512820544,0.000512820512820544,0.000512820512820544,0.000512820512820544,0.000512820512820544,0.000512820512820544,0.000512820512820544,0.05674196224684236,0.000512820512820544,0.000512820512820544,0.000512820512820544,0.000512820512820544,0.027687072482256117,0.000512820512820544,0.000512820512820544,0.000512820512820544,0.000512820512820544,0.000512820512820544,0.000512820512820544,0.2670160309584602,0.07964791028239245,0.104834323005078,0.000512820512820544,0.000512820512820544,0.000512820512820544,0.000512820512820544,0.000512820512820544,0.000512820512820544,0.000512820512820544,0.000512820512820544,0.000512820512820544,0.000512820512820544,0.000512820512820544,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I like the way that Imogene and Maxine stayed friends all the way through the book . The two girls really seemed to bring out the best in each other . Maxine never thought Imogene was crazy because of the strange things that happened . Maxine just believed her and helped her through everything .

This is a travel volume for those who plan to visit the out of the ordinary places as well as a scrapbook for those who have been to the more accessible places , but is it more : this is a closer look at the planet we inhabit that is so magnificent it urges us by images alone to protect the beauty we threaten to destroy . Recommended .

51725,1,"The Source for True Armanen Runelore Guido von List was the leader of the Armanen - Orden , the single most important magical order of the 20th century . This book deserves to be on every thinking Germanic Heathen and Magician 's bookshelf ... Many of List 's ideas influenced the most important thinkers of the modern Heathen revival , including Edred Thorsson ...

51732,1,"A strong argument for tort reform Here is the disclaimer : I was already a proponent of tort reform before I read this book . However , after reading this novel , I am a stronger proponent of it than ever . Enter Clay Carter - unknown defender in D.C. of the poorest of the poor . Then a nice juicy settlement falls into his lap , one he ca n't refuse , partly because the parent 's of his long - time girlfriend are pressuring him regarding his money . Give Carter a taste of money , then the greed sets in . For the middle half of the book , we get to see unadulterated greed come to run his life ! Especially infuriating is how he lets that greed come before the well - being of his clients . This is what will be his undoing . One of his clients who was already ticked off at a settlement he made gets a terminal illness and decides to go after his lawyer . This is the rags to riches to almost rags in the course of about eighteen months . Grisham actually makes you feel sympathetic with the main charater ( Clay Carter ) through his rise , and especially his fall . That shows to the quality of his storytelling . In fact , while Carter is in some ways a sympathetic character , he mostly is not ! Mass torts and greed is the theme of this story . The fact that he came back to haunt him was only justice . Too bad such justice does n't often happen in the real world of mass torts",282,1,0.0005000000000000389,0.07138099514060091,0.05878606633166059,0.0005000000000000389,0.0005000000000000389,0.0005000000000000389,0.0005000000000000389,0.24834333961297378,0.0005000000000000389,0.0005000000000000389,0.0005000000000000389,0.0005000000000000389,0.0005000000000000389,0.0005000000000000389,0.025499999999981277,0.0005000000000000389,0.059440835582242495,0.0005000000000000389,0.0005000000000000389,0.0005000000000000389,0.0005000000000000389,0.0005000000000000389,0.0005000000000000389,0.0005000000000000389,0.07836099042546753,0.0005000000000000389,0.0005000000000000389,0.0005000000000000389,0.0005000000000000389,0.0005000000000000389,0.0005000000000000389,0.0005000000000000389,0.0005000000000000389,0.0005000000000000389,0.09141278281139287,0.0005000000000000389,0.25028712649802887,0.0005000000000000389,0.0005000000000000389,0.06704178836430938,0.0005000000000000389,0.0005000000000000389,0.029446075233340707,0.0005000000000000389,0.0005000000000000389,0.0005000000000000389,0.0005000000000000389,0.0005000000000000389,0.0005000000000000389,0.0005000000000000389,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

51739,1,"Sharp insight from Virginia Postrel I consider myself an optimist and insightful person , but somehow managed to miss many of Postrel 's insights . She gives me even more hope that the future is going to be more wonderful than I previously thought . She does keep that hope in check , though , by talking about the enemies of the future- primarily protectionists and those that see free trade as a threat , instead of the blessing that it is . She thoroughly destroys the notion that ' there is nothing new under that sun ' . While the universe , therefore our earth , is necessarily finite , we misunderstand this finiteness because we misunderstand the different combinations things can be arranged in . For example , a deck of cards has only 52 cards , but the number of combinations you can put the cards into is 52x51x50x49x ... x3x2x1 , which is a number larger than the number of particles in the universe ! So whenever you shuffle a deck of cards , you can rest assured , that that is probably the one and only time that arrangement of cards will ever be in existence ... ever . People are so inventive and creative and always looking for new things . Obviously , there will always be new things . Every time someone declares that we are nearing the end of history , science , technology , etc . it 's safe to say they have no idea what they are talking about .

51743,1,"Yoga of the heart This book is about yoga for the heart , which is rare in our body sculpting culture , yet paradoxically heart diseases are one of the greatest risk factors for our modern health . A simple , profound gift of yoga is the recognition that the body is the temple for the indwelling spirit . Realizing this simple truth profoundly affects our relationship to the body . Through the author 's lifetime committment to the teachings of yoga , we glimpse the relevance of the yogic lifestyle . This book serves as a guide in making healthier choices in everyday life . By walking for awhile with Nischala , we touch a deeper realization of the unity that yoga brings .

51753,1,"Another "" I wish I would have read this earlier in life ! "" book Whether you are new to dating , widowed or divorced and starting to date again , or in your 50th year of marriage - you will be able to gleam something from this book that will impact your life in a positive way . Ideally - you could read this book before you embark upon the "" dating chapter "" of your life . But , even if you 're not new to dating , this book can make an amazing and positive impact in many ways - it can increase your chances of finding the right person , reduce your chances of being hurt by or hurting someone ( emotionally ) during the dating process , and help you avoid scaring away someone with whom , otherwise , you could end up having a wonderful relationship . I especially recommend this to women who are in a relationship ( or , who are thinking that they "" thought they were "" ) with a man who seems to have changed all of a sudden . If you are questioning things like , where did he go ? why did n't he call ? why does he seem so distant now ? what did I do wrong ? - you are possibly at a point in the relationship where your choice of actions can make or break a relationship that might just be on the edge of going somewhere . And , likewise , I recommend this to men who feel that they 've come to a point in their relationship where they all of a sudden "" are n't sure "" anymore , are feeling anxious or maybe even "" trapped "" , and at the same time there is a strong need to just get away and think and/or if the woman you are dating seems to have become more insecure , worries more , questions you more , starts pressuring you more about commitment , etc . All of these situations , emotions , etc . are explained in this book . You 're not the only one - it 's a normal part of dating - but , unfortunately , most of us wo n't possibly be able to understand this without someone else pointing it out to us - like Gray has done in this book . Even if you are married - this book opens your eyes to many things and can really improve your level of understanding with your wife / husband . If you are the perfect mate in a perfect relationship - you may not realize some of the problems other people experience and therefore , could probably benefit from this book by being able to better identify with friends , family , children when they come to you for advice",485,1,0.00023809523809525615,0.14087143766543525,0.00023809523809525615,0.00023809523809525615,0.00023809523809525615,0.00023809523809525615,0.012433369988238742,0.15335956955645,0.00023809523809525615,0.00023809523809525615,0.00023809523809525615,0.030886624439447716,0.25286441057698605,0.00023809523809525615,0.00023809523809525615,0.00023809523809525615,0.00023809523809525615,0.00023809523809525615,0.00023809523809525615,0.00023809523809525615,0.00023809523809525615,0.00023809523809525615,0.00023809523809525615,0.00023809523809525615,0.00023809523809525615,0.00023809523809525615,0.00023809523809525615,0.00023809523809525615,0.00023809523809525615,0.00023809523809525615,0.00023809523809525615,0.00023809523809525615,0.00023809523809525615,0.00023809523809525615,0.041415502633658945,0.01241791592429757,0.22920127585820663,0.00023809523809525615,0.00023809523809525615,0.017983638883588157,0.00023809523809525615,0.00023809523809525615,0.028088328990805773,0.00023809523809525615,0.07119221119717048,0.00023809523809525615,0.00023809523809525615,0.00023809523809525615,0.00023809523809525615,0.00023809523809525615,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0
51763,1,A story of survival How does she do it ? This will forever be one of my favorite books . Reading about the astoundingly crazy life Mary Karr had as a child made me wonder how her sense of humor could be so sharp and perfect and still get across the sadness and pathos without making me feel bad or hopeless . Nor did I feel that she was in a hopeless situation . It always seemed as though there were morsels of goodness somewhere to be found . A profoundly inspiring book . I only hope I can be as resourceful and resilient,104,1,0.001111111111111191,0.001111111111111191,0.001111111111111191,0.001111111111111191,0.001111111111111191,0.001111111111111191,0.001111111111111191,0.001111111111111191,0.058562035852197894,0.001111111111111191,0.001111111111111191,0.001111111111111191,0.001111111111111191,0.001111111111111191,0.001111111111111191,0.001111111111111191,0.20594461623525723,0.001111111111111191,0.001111111111111191,0.001111111111111191,0.001111111111111191,0.001111111111111191,0.001111111111111191,0.0602352670980009,0.001111111111111191,0.001111111111111191,0.001111111111111191,0.001111111111111191,0.001111111111111191,0.001111111111111191,0.001111111111111191,0.001111111111111191,0.001111111111111191,0.001111111111111191,0.001111111111111191,0.10293190375733141,0.4090979798918969,0.001111111111111191,0.001111111111111191,0.05878372430719093,0.001111111111111191,0.056666695080343624,0.001111111111111191,0.001111111111111191,0.001111111111111191,0.001111111111111191,0.001111111111111191,0.001111111111111191,0.001111111111111191,0.001111111111111191,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1
51766,1,"Having to live another day was the worst nightmare ... In 2003 I suffered my worst major depression ever . It lasted for over a year , and in the worst moments -which lasted months- my anguish was so intense that I wished I were dead . Again , the worst part was when I could n't even get a full night 's rest , and after just two or three hours of sleep would wake up at 2 or 3 a.m. full of despair , unable to even pray or meditate or get any kind of relief , and anguished at the prospect of the new day approaching ... Having to get up in the morning was hell . Needless to say I could n't work , and that increased my ill - feelings and my guilt at seeing how my wife had to shoulder the full responsibility in our family of four ( we have two adolescent kids ) . Reading Andrew Solomon 's book , which I found recommended at depression - blog at blogspot dot com was an extraordinary experience , because for the first time ever I found my own reflected on the written page by a gifted writer who has also suffered the extreme anguish and pain of major depression . In my illness , I found that psychiatrists , doctors and other therapists who have n't themselves gone through the hellish nightmare of a major depression simply can not understand what it is like . It 's just like what happens with someone who has never eaten an orange : no matter how much you you try to explain how it tastes , the other person will have no real understanding unless he / she eats one him / herself . Same with friends and well - wishers of many sorts , who will tell you things like "" Cheer up ! "" or "" Make an effort ! "" without realizing that that 's precisely what you would most want to do -but ca n't . Solomon 's book and the advise of Mike S. -now a friend , and the guy who created the depression - blog at blogspot dot com- have been of great value to me . And of course the courage and love of my wife , who never -even in the worst moments , when we both thought I might die at any moment- abandoned hope , sustaining me , putting up with a lot , holding me when I cried in utmost despair and wished I were dead as the only relief in the midst of what now I recall as the worst kind of torture a human being can be subjected to ... And my kids , too , who at times even made me laugh with a joke or helped me get some sleep with a massage . And God , who in the midst of utter darkness and despair , was there too , and saw me through",505,1,0.00026666666666669373,0.00026666666666669373,0.045513684873445315,0.14902206364798112,0.00026666666666669373,0.028209981596038526,0.00026666666666669373,0.11279908128354606,0.00026666666666669373,0.00026666666666669373,0.00026666666666669373,0.013611045574789014,0.17229947333498744,0.00026666666666669373,0.00026666666666669373,0.00026666666666669373,0.00026666666666669373,0.00026666666666669373,0.00026666666666669373,0.00026666666666669373,0.23850734098559448,0.00026666666666669373,0.00026666666666669373,0.00026666666666669373,0.00026666666666669373,0.00026666666666669373,0.00026666666666669373,0.00026666666666669373,0.00026666666666669373,0.00026666666666669373,0.00026666666666669373,0.00026666666666669373,0.00026666666666669373,0.00026666666666669373,0.06885376034023831,0.00026666666666669373,0.11274381655916288,0.00026666666666669373,0.00026666666666669373,0.00026666666666669373,0.00026666666666669373,0.00026666666666669373,0.047773085137549264,0.00026666666666669373,0.00026666666666669373,0.00026666666666669373,0.00026666666666669373,0.00026666666666669373,0.00026666666666669373,0.00026666666666669373,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

51776,1,"A wonderful peice of American religious history This item is a must - have for anyone who is serious about understanding the origins of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - Day Saints ( LDS or Mormons for short ) . While not an authentic artifact , it is an excellent reproduction of the original book that started one of America 's most successful and controversial social - religious movements of the 19th and 20th centuries . This reproduction allows the reader to read the original 19th century language style of structure and grammar as it fell from the lips of Joseph Smith ( Author and Proprietor ) to the pen(s ) of his various scribes . When the book is placed in it 's historical context , the reader can see the doctrinal development of many of the key points of theology that are the underpinning of the current LDS Church as well as Smith 's answers for many of the religious concerns of his day . Also , interestingly , when compared to the current version of the book and the LDS Church today , the reader can see the evolution of church doctrine over time . For Example : The development from a monotheistic doctrine of deity ( see book of 1 Nephi and Mosiah - also see Lectures on Faith , also by Smith ) , to the current polytheistic doctrine that the church espouses ( see current version of the Book of Mormon - changing of the text in 1 Nephi to correspond with current church doctrine ) . The original condemnation of polygamy ( marriage to more than one wife at a time ) with the exception of raising up a righteous posterity ( see book of Jacob ) , to the open endorsement and practice of the same from the mid to late 19th century for no reason other than Smith saying that God commanded the practice , then to the abandonment of the practice in order to prevent Church property from being confiscated and to allow Utah statehood in the union . The condemnation of secret , oath - bound clandestine societies ( see book of Helaman , 3 Nephi , Ether ) to the practice of blood oaths of secrecy , loyalty and revenge ( for the murder of Smith ) in the Masonic - derived Nauvoo temple endowment . The original condemnation and futility of Baptism for children and those that die without the law ( see book of Mormon - name of a section within the book ) , to the practice of performing all church ordinances ( including baptism ) vicariously for the dead ( those that died without the law ) . Like all religious / social / mass movements , the LDS Church will evolve and change to meet the needs of its members . The importance of this book for any follower of the religion ( or student of sociology , history , etc . ) is to chart the origins of the institution and then follow it 's metamorphosis over time as the institution attempts to adapt to a constantly changing and growing market . For that reason alone the book receives 5 stars .",542,1,0.0003703703703704055,0.0003703703703704055,0.0003703703703704055,0.0003703703703704055,0.0003703703703704055,0.0003703703703704055,0.0003703703703704055,0.1142017239584574,0.05798612013915037,0.0003703703703704055,0.0003703703703704055,0.01888888888888886,0.0003703703703704055,0.0003703703703704055,0.0003703703703704055,0.0003703703703704055,0.0003703703703704055,0.0003703703703704055,0.01888888888888908,0.0003703703703704055,0.0003703703703704055,0.0003703703703704055,0.0003703703703704055,0.0003703703703704055,0.0003703703703704055,0.0003703703703704055,0.0003703703703704055,0.0003703703703704055,0.0003703703703704055,0.0003703703703704055,0.0003703703703704055,0.06351393589636223,0.0003703703703704055,0.0003703703703704055,0.019988740291629777,0.0003703703703704055,0.5017588252676031,0.01974080193685615,0.14382473457198588,0.0003703703703704055,0.0003703703703704055,0.0003703703703704055,0.02639252534536089,0.0003703703703704055,0.0003703703703704055,0.0003703703703704055,0.0003703703703704055,0.0003703703703704055,0.0003703703703704055,0.0003703703703704055,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

51800,1,"Timing is everything , and you wo n't have it . One reviewer of this book said he 's sick of investing tomes , they offer no practical benefit except to enrich the authors , who usually run money management firms for which the books are meant to recruit clients . And of course those firms charge hefty fees , even if their timing is slightly off ( say , a few years or so ) . Another reviewer loved the book because he realizes he is going to have to work harder to invest successfully over coming years . If only he had read the book in 1999 . What is not fully understood by many investors is that the money game is run by Wall Streeters with whom you can not compete and beat over time . Some of the smartest people in the world work on the Street and they are not sharing what they know with anybody . But they want you in the game . They need you . They take care of their biggest clients ( and I mean really big ) and every client who is not big is late to the table and last to leave , usually at a loss . Because smaller clients start buying what the big players are just starting to sell . Which is why the big holders sell in dribs and drabs over time . Every winning trade requires a losing trade . Too bad , past results are no etc . etc . Try to work the market independently against the big guns and you will eventually come to know the meaning of whipsaw . And its consequences . Everybody thinks they can get out in time . Trouble is , when markets tank -- stock market , real estate markets -- there is no getting out because there are no buyers . It 's a free fall without a parachute . Many real estate speculators will learn this in the coming year . The author of this book , Ed Eastering , is well respected and can give you a good view of how the game works . Which is useful in a textbook kind of way . And he attempts to lay out some tips for the solo investor . Trouble is , timing IS everything and the information you need to time the market is not going to be found in any book . Or any proprietary system being peddled over the internet . If it worked that well they would not be selling it to you . So what 's the answer ? Contrarian investing ? When everybody is long , go short , and vice versa ? Good idea but it requires a discipline that can tear apart the innards of a veteran Wall Street trader . It is just not wired into the systems of most people to pull it off . And reliable sell signals are about as hard to find as a legitimate 1918 Inverted Jenny . Another possibility : do what most of the really rich usually do , stuff it into long - term U.S. Treasuries that pay a fixed interest rate and guarantee the principal at maturity . Of course , you have to keep them for the long term , which the really rich can afford to do . Can you ? If not , you may sell the bond at a loss that negates the interest you were paid . So you 're stuck with safe U.S. short - term notes which mature at par and pay the promised ( usually much lower ) interest rate . Not very exciting . And if inflation pops your interest rate may give you breakeven or less . Well , that 's tough unless you had the cojones to buy one of the most volatile commodities in existence : gold . This is a truly ferocious trap that has ruined many . The big guns say do n't speculate with money you ca n't afford to lose . Hey , thanks . That fits about .001 percent of the investing population . Read Easterling for the historical big picture . And it ai n't a pretty picture . It 's all about volatility and volatility is a killer . And so the moral of the story may be to be very careful with your investment decisions . Err on the side of caution . The first consideration of the physician is Do No Harm . The first consideration of the financial investor is Lose Not Thy Wad . Of couse there is the notion that markets investing is really just another excuse to excerise the gambling urge for people who consider casinos crass .

51802,1,"Classic statement of animal liberation In the 1970 's , Peter Singer came out with a radical argument which was new in the field of ethics ; animal liberation . While some philosophers and others had in the past , argued for the necessity of being kind to animals ( Schopenhauer probably being the most notable case because of his deep respect for Buddhism ) , Peter Singer was probably the first philosopher in Western philosophy to set out a systematic rational set of arguments for regarding the rights of animals . Singer 's primary argument , and a very interesting one , is science has demonstrated we show very close connections to many kinds of animals , particularly in the structures of our vital organs , nervous systems and brains . Singer gathers some strong evidence from biology showing how many animal species are apparently capable of feeling pain and hence of suffering . On these grounds Singer argues animals are entitled to certain rights , at least when they are being used by humans . The fact animals can suffer means we ca n't just treat them as another form of material object or resource for our use , but we need to consider them as fellow beings . Singer builds up a set of arguments against eating animals , using animals in agricultural contexts , using animals for scientific experimentation , or using animals for commercial research such as the testing of cosmetic products . Singer draws on some infamous and damning experiments which seem to have caused terrible pain and suffering to animals for little apparent gain in scientific knowledge , including the use of ' rape racks ' and virtual torture of infant monkeys in one series of experiments . At the end of the book , Singer presents several vegetarian recipies and hopes readers will stop eating meat on this example . Singer 's work has been very powerful in its influence , and several philosophers built on and expanded on his work . However , others have criticized his arguments quite strongly , on many grounds . It has also become a kind of manifesto for many animal rights campaigners and animal liberationists , some of whom have resorted to violent means to ' free ' animals from scientific experimentation . While I admire Singer 's rigorous arguments as well as the formidable evidence he marshals to back it , I can not entirely agree with them . It seems that at least some scientific research involving animals is necessary for fighting many awful diseases and conditions which cause terrible human suffering . I think a total ban on animal research , especially medical research and biotechnology research aimed at improving human health , is excessive . Animals also form an essential part of the livelihood of many people around the world . No doubt in many cases some practices lead to animals suffering , but does this mean all useage of animals in agriculture should be stopped ? Where do we make changes ? When do we make them ? I certainly agree agriculture should be done in such a way animal cruelty is removed , and suffering reduced as much as possible , but preventing all suffering is impossible , and reality will require compromise . Also as another ecologist remarked , sometimes practices which cause harm to an individual animal is necessary to protect the overall ecosystem . Hunting rabbits and kangeroos or cats or horses will cause suffering to these creatures , but is often a necessity in Australia where in many areas these animals are dangerous pests that ruin the native environment through overpopulation or hunting . Still , the strongest thing in favour of Singer 's thesis is that we do share a profound connection with nature , and our terrible disregard for the biosphere is coming back to haunt us in the form of mass extinctions of species . We certainly need to redevelop a sense of what Edmund Wilson calls ' biophilia ' , a sense of affinity with nature and the natural world , rather than simply seeing it as another object to gratify our desires",702,1,0.28065385910060386,0.03350810270456037,0.0002816901408451023,0.0002816901408451023,0.0002816901408451023,0.0002816901408451023,0.0002816901408451023,0.25566341086629085,0.0002816901408451023,0.0002816901408451023,0.0779407866209936,0.0002816901408451023,0.0002816901408451023,0.0002816901408451023,0.0002816901408451023,0.0002816901408451023,0.0002816901408451023,0.0002816901408451023,0.0002816901408451023,0.0002816901408451023,0.0002816901408451023,0.0002816901408451023,0.0002816901408451023,0.015084958258527825,0.0002816901408451023,0.0562900607160195,0.0002816901408451023,0.0002816901408451023,0.0002816901408451023,0.0002816901408451023,0.0002816901408451023,0.0002816901408451023,0.12129222890304073,0.0002816901408451023,0.0002816901408451023,0.0002816901408451023,0.025637272311469266,0.0002816901408451023,0.0002816901408451023,0.0002816901408451023,0.0002816901408451023,0.0002816901408451023,0.0002816901408451023,0.0381646982058196,0.0002816901408451023,0.0002816901408451023,0.08449701667887043,0.0002816901408451023,0.0002816901408451023,0.0002816901408451023,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0

51814,1,"A Good Man 's Long Journey John Tyree is a soldier first , a man second . Or so he thinks until he meets Savannah Lynn Curtis . While on leave , he falls desperately in love with Savannah , the proverbial girl of his dreams . Sweet , intelligent , and giving , John knows he 'll always carry her torch . When September 11 changes the world , John is no exception . Moved by patriotic loyalty , he chooses to "" re - up "" in the army , adding time to his service and breaking his promise to return to Savannah . More promises are broken when he must attending to his ailing father . This is the story of how an ideal love can falter , despite its purity and strength . Not every romance results in a happy ending , but with a great deal of luck , those who do n't survive will find meaning from the experience . Love , loyalty , friendship -- all those sentiments are great , but to what cost ? And how does this make a good man great ? This is John 's journey to that understanding . It goes without saying that Nicholas Sparks is one of today 's "" master "" storytellers . Part of what makes him so successful is that he has the ability to create moving stories without pulling punches or painful twists . Such is the case in DEAR JOHN . Sparks offers a love story that has all the requisite components -- well - crafted setting , high emotion , obstacles , resolution -- then breaks it . It is from the sadness that hope emerges , and John Tyree , although still quite young , gains wisdom that will last a lifetime . Sorrow will be a large part of this , yes , but there is room for something more , something that will reach beyond the pages and touch John 's tomorrow in a way only he will see . While this works , there is something lacking . It is one of those hard - to - define qualities that marks the difference between a good book and one that is outstanding . Maybe it 's the heavy reliance on John 's soldiering as an excuse for certain behaviors . Or perhaps it has more to do with aspects relating to John 's relationship with his father , who appears to have Asperger 's syndrome . I'm giving DEAR JOHN 4-Books for a beautiful story , but not five because of that indefinable element that was lost between idea and paper .

51837,1,"Incredibly Useful ! As a prospective college student , I have to tell you how much I appreciate Students ' Guide to Colleges . It combines many of the best features of the Princeton Review and Fiske guides with much more comprehensiveness . I also appreciate that it is without any trying - to - sound - hip blather because these are not editor - interjected profiles , they 're written by actual students . This is a great compliment -- I have been looking at colleges seriously for about a year , and this is the best guide to colleges among the many I 've seen . I also just read the Oberlin College profile in this book with an Oberlin alum and relative . She said that this was this most comprehensive and accurate Oberlin portrayal she 's read in a guide . Among other things , she and I loved the different student perspectives and the unthinkable - in - previous - guides questions like "" what aspect of your school would a prospective student not see on a college tour ? "" The guide 's honesty also impressed me , as the Fiske guide lauded Vassar 's "" diversity , "" for example , where Students ' Guide admits "" Although Vassar likes to talk about diversity a lot , most students are actually wealthy and white .

51845,1,"All the world 's children have the same wants and needs I am a Lutheran church librarian and I am glad I bought this very satisfactory book for our church library . Its text stresses that children are the same the world over . They have the same feelings and needs , and have the same hopes and dreams . The illustrations are a nice change from the usual . Each page is surrounded by a gold picture frame in which faux jewels are embedded . The illustrations appear to be tempera or opaque watercolor , drawn in Persian style . The colors are very saturated . The book 's cover gives you an idea of what they look like . The message of this book is one of diversity -- that even though children live in different parts of the world and may have different nationalities , races , ethnicities , languages or faiths , they still have the same hopes , dreams and daily needs . This is a very important message for children to hear in today 's world where there is so much suspicion of those we "" perceive "" to be different . The more children realize that kids are the same everywhere , the more tolerant they will be . Children pick up prejudice by the time they are three years of age , say researchers , so you have to nip it in the bud very early , and this book does that in a wonderful way .",255,1,0.14742377095344822,0.00042553191489365025,0.00042553191489365025,0.00042553191489365025,0.00042553191489365025,0.02688841173436613,0.00042553191489365025,0.1390052752708976,0.00042553191489365025,0.00042553191489365025,0.00042553191489365025,0.03010824852005155,0.00042553191489365025,0.00042553191489365025,0.00042553191489365025,0.00042553191489365025,0.00042553191489365025,0.02810795486030269,0.00042553191489365025,0.00042553191489365025,0.00042553191489365025,0.00042553191489365025,0.00042553191489365025,0.00042553191489365025,0.00042553191489365025,0.00042553191489365025,0.00042553191489365025,0.00042553191489365025,0.00042553191489365025,0.026428451216124776,0.00042553191489365025,0.00042553191489365025,0.00042553191489365025,0.00042553191489365025,0.2285134921273532,0.00042553191489365025,0.20824391359697514,0.00042553191489365025,0.00042553191489365025,0.00042553191489365025,0.00042553191489365025,0.00042553191489365025,0.00042553191489365025,0.00042553191489365025,0.00042553191489365025,0.1478336732098409,0.00042553191489365025,0.00042553191489365025,0.00042553191489365025,0.00042553191489365025,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

Some things are easy to find in the picture and others are more challenging . It is a beautiful book that provides "" I spy "" and "" Where 's Waldo "" type challenges . I highly recommend this book for the 1 - 5 crowd",129,1,0.0007407407407407899,0.0007407407407407899,0.0007407407407407899,0.0007407407407407899,0.0007407407407407899,0.0007407407407407899,0.037777777777778195,0.0007407407407407899,0.10985487288726564,0.0007407407407407899,0.0007407407407407899,0.07287968008816847,0.0007407407407407899,0.0007407407407407899,0.0007407407407407899,0.0007407407407407899,0.0007407407407407899,0.057674391948793986,0.0007407407407407899,0.0007407407407407899,0.0007407407407407899,0.0007407407407407899,0.0007407407407407899,0.18746637907922908,0.09089746128137607,0.0007407407407407899,0.0007407407407407899,0.0007407407407407899,0.0007407407407407899,0.0805506455076597,0.0007407407407407899,0.0007407407407407899,0.0007407407407407899,0.0007407407407407899,0.0007407407407407899,0.0007407407407407899,0.22055498152131642,0.0007407407407407899,0.07213103777806905,0.0007407407407407899,0.0007407407407407899,0.0007407407407407899,0.0007407407407407899,0.0007407407407407899,0.0007407407407407899,0.04058314250071179,0.0007407407407407899,0.0007407407407407899,0.0007407407407407899,0.0007407407407407899,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

51861,1,"Great for Veteran freezer cooks ! If you have been freezer cooking for awhile or are completely new to it you will enjoy this book because it has a different spin on freezer cooking than the classics . I started with Once - a - Month - cooking and at the time it seemed revolutionary , but , though I loved it was a hard days work . Then came Jill Bond and she was really talking bulk cooking ! When Deborah 's first book came out I was excited because it fit in with my low - on - cash , short - on - time lifestyle . This book is terrific because it provides a healthy alternative that is still pretty inexpensive . The meals are more than casserole and there are lots of options that are more appealing for the warmer weather when you do n't want to heat up the kitchen . My favorites are the Cheese and Chicken Shells ( not for everyone however ) Chicken Enchiladas ( taste great made with homemade whole - wheat tortilla , if you do that ) , Crab rice Chowder ( gourmet ) , Bean Casserole and everyone LOVES Spaghetti Pie . There are lots of good recipes in this book . The drawbacks of this book is that after a few initial sessions I felt that I was more likely to choose some favorites than to use her already laid out sessions ... that is okay , but , not as easy as using the shopping lists and plans . Worth trying if you are serious about Freezer Cooking , but I would start with Frozen Assest first",281,1,0.0004761904761905168,0.23469508849516504,0.08557887164452518,0.0004761904761905168,0.053623604247756584,0.03749598847042525,0.0004761904761905168,0.0004761904761905168,0.0004761904761905168,0.0004761904761905168,0.0004761904761905168,0.0004761904761905168,0.0004761904761905168,0.0004761904761905168,0.0004761904761905168,0.0004761904761905168,0.0004761904761905168,0.0004761904761905168,0.0004761904761905168,0.03985506325074047,0.0004761904761905168,0.0004761904761905168,0.0004761904761905168,0.0004761904761905168,0.0004761904761905168,0.0004761904761905168,0.0004761904761905168,0.0004761904761905168,0.0004761904761905168,0.026325470068963488,0.0004761904761905168,0.0004761904761905168,0.09755891244379938,0.0004761904761905168,0.0004761904761905168,0.0004761904761905168,0.21943658112788134,0.0004761904761905168,0.0004761904761905168,0.0004761904761905168,0.0004761904761905168,0.0004761904761905168,0.0004761904761905168,0.0004761904761905168,0.0672125660492811,0.0004761904761905168,0.11917023515384134,0.0004761904761905168,0.0004761904761905168,0.0004761904761905168,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0

51865,1,"Masterpiece of Western fiction . The Big Sky is not just a masterpiece , it 's probably THE masterpiece of the genre of western frontier fiction . This is unusual because it deals with a moment in time that is n't really dealt with that much - the Rocky Mountain fur trade during its golden age of about 1820 - 1850 . The cowboy era has been responsible for most of western film and literature , partly because the images and events that happen in that world are recognizable to us : the economic and social issues you always see dealt with in "" cowboy "" movies mirror our own experiences in many ways . The cowboy has also been said to be an image of freedom to Americans , when actually nothing was further from the truth . Cowboys were regular working stiffs , about as romantic as carpenters or plumbers in their own day . They did n't consider themselves "" free "" , nor would they have spent much time thinking about it during their brutal 14 hour work day . They did what they did because they loved horses and riding and cattle and it was good honest work that paid a living wage , and there was a bit of swagger to it - people in town recognized cow hands for the tough - as - leather men they were , especially with their characteristic boots and hats and general flair for the dramatic that many had . But it was backbreaking work , and the entire cowboy heydey lasted less than 30 years . I said all that to say that "" The Big Sky "" really is about freedom , and really is about the West . It 's about the true , wild , primitive west , before the plow , before roads , when there were still huge , intact Indian cultures in place with armies of horsemen and enormous herds of buffalo . So it 's interesting to me that this genre is largely ignored , but I can see why - there are no set - piece plots just begging to be turned into movies - no "" new sherriff in town "" characters , because there are no sherriffs , and no towns other than a few trading posts . There is only the land and the sky and the interaction between a few incredibly brave white men and all those Indians . If you do n't already know , this is the story of Boone Caudill and his friend Jim Deakins , and several important side characters , but it 's basically Boone 's book . He 's driven west by an aching need for wildness and freedom , and is pushed out by a brutal father . He makes his way west to St. Louis , along the way befriending Deakins , in hopes of meeting his uncle Zeb who had become a trapper years earlier . The rest of the tail is complex and interlaced , and not a simplistic good guy / bad guy plot at all , and what stands out is the crystalline depictions of the people and places and over all , arching like the sky itself , is freedom . Freedom to roam at will in that beautiful country is the main character of this book . Freedom is the religion , the politics , the philosophy , the recreation - it is everything that is important . The trappers are there to trap - sure - but they 're really there because this is a wild , free place , where they will not be hampered by rules , where they can be natural men . It sounds over romanticized , but it really did happen that way , and from what we know , that is truly the way they felt about their lives and why they endured the agonies of that existence . Despairing that new settlers are moving west and building farms and towns , Boone cries "" Lord , Jim - remember the Tetons standing proud in the sun , and the Seeds Ke Dee ... don't you remember her when she was all purty and new and not a man track on her save Injun ? "" This novel makes you sob like few I 've ever read . The sense of loss , the closing of an age of the world , hangs in the air like mist . They are going to be the last to see something so precious , and for their pains they get to watch their world wither and die under the press of settlement . The movie "" The Mountain Men "" with Charleton Heston comes close to capturing a tiny bit of this book , and you can tell it 's inspired in many ways by it , but no other book or film has ever come close to truly painting the world of the mountain man as has this novel . "" Jeremiah Johnson "" is another good film , with many fine touches . But if you want to follow the water up stream , back to its source in the mountains , then please , before you grow too old , read "" The Big Sky "" and open your heart to that time and place and the wild , brazen beauty of the America few Americans know ever existed",917,1,0.00014598540145986788,0.10860112648280969,0.00014598540145986788,0.00014598540145986788,0.00014598540145986788,0.007545839505116563,0.00014598540145986788,0.18091282454025598,0.00014598540145986788,0.00014598540145986788,0.00014598540145986788,0.00014598540145986788,0.18453515720159674,0.00014598540145986788,0.00014598540145986788,0.00014598540145986788,0.0426317519457028,0.00014598540145986788,0.00743099666190272,0.00014598540145986788,0.13544490266228704,0.00014598540145986788,0.00014598540145986788,0.00014598540145986788,0.00014598540145986788,0.015468980223434011,0.00014598540145986788,0.00014598540145986788,0.00014598540145986788,0.00014598540145986788,0.00014598540145986788,0.00014598540145986788,0.00014598540145986788,0.00014598540145986788,0.03298405911870528,0.007618690322402952,0.11736512319008173,0.00014598540145986788,0.01834354262917943,0.00014598540145986788,0.031173638112850694,0.00783276700798541,0.00849799135596408,0.08864910539008918,0.00014598540145986788,0.00014598540145986788,0.00014598540145986788,0.00014598540145986788,0.00014598540145986788,0.00014598540145986788,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

51874,1,"Excellent though flawed intellectual history of the 20th century Peter Watson , holding a number of research degrees , offers a comprehensive intellectual history of the 20th century in this book . Not being an easy read , it takes some time to get through . The main strengths of this book are placing the intellectual development of the 20th century in its economic and social context . This is quite an achievement , considering the remarkable scientific and technological advances and the fragmentation of human knowledge into many small and specialised areas in very arcane topics . Watson tends to cover science the best , and provides excellent accounts of the development and progress of 20th century science , including the theories of relativity , quantum mechanics , scientific cosmology , evolutionary biology and the discovery of the gene . However , the book falls down in some parts where it covers philosophy . Watson dismisses Husserl 's Phenomenology as ' abstract ' and of little importance , when in fact Phenomenology was probably the most important philosophical school in the 20th century along with analytical philosophy , founded by Russell and Wittgeinstein , and attracted so many leading European minds to philosophy in a time when science was at its zenith of glory . Overall though , Watson 's work is a very important attempt to see where we are in what we know , and where we are going .",243,1,0.0006250000000000573,0.0006250000000000573,0.0006250000000000573,0.0006250000000000573,0.0006250000000000573,0.0006250000000000573,0.0006250000000000573,0.051594041947748547,0.0006250000000000573,0.0006250000000000573,0.0006250000000000573,0.0006250000000000573,0.0006250000000000573,0.0006250000000000573,0.0006250000000000573,0.0006250000000000573,0.0006250000000000573,0.0006250000000000573,0.0006250000000000573,0.0006250000000000573,0.0006250000000000573,0.0006250000000000573,0.0006250000000000573,0.0006250000000000573,0.04972864984658778,0.06632825343664465,0.0006250000000000573,0.0006250000000000573,0.0006250000000000573,0.0006250000000000573,0.0006250000000000573,0.12474978411157575,0.0006250000000000573,0.0006250000000000573,0.04280427314562798,0.0006250000000000573,0.3619631211843127,0.0006250000000000573,0.12103206733069409,0.0006250000000000573,0.0006250000000000573,0.0006250000000000573,0.0006250000000000573,0.0006250000000000573,0.15554980899680607,0.0006250000000000573,0.0006250000000000573,0.0006250000000000573,0.0006250000000000573,0.0006250000000000573,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

51878,1,"Finally , a truly advanced scripting book for VBScript Having worked with VBScript for a little over four years I am by no means an expert ; however , I feel that my experience does give me somewhat of an advanced applied knowledge of scripting . I was pretty skeptical when I saw the word "" Advanced "" in the title , but this book laid all my concerns to rest in the early chapters . The book begins with securing ( including digital certs and policies ) and encoding scripts as well as listing some nice techniques for implementing alternate credentials in WMI and ADSI . For me personally , the real meat and potatoes of the book was the copious information pertaining to working with WSF and WSC files . Don and Jeffrey take the time to detail the reasons behind XML functionality as well as it 's application within the scripted files . These guys clear up a lot of questions on these two subjects and how to package your scripts using these technologies . They wrap up the package peice with explanations around HTA 's and form controls in HTML scripts . The book moves on to cover topics such as ADSI and ADO scripting , working with WshController and remote scripts , WMI and WQL classes and techniques , and different applicable real world examples . All this information is then wrapped up with tidbits of using scripting editors to debug , sign , and package your scripts as well the wizards ( WMI , ADSI , WSF , etc ) and other tools available to make scripting easier . I've obtained quite a few VBScript books over the years and this one is by far the only one dedicated to truly advanced VBScripting . If you are new to scripting with VBScript , you might want to start with another book geared to learning the methods , properties , classes , etc of the syntax and the technologies it can use . While this book does offer great explanations on advanced topics , you really need to have a solid background in scripting before you read it . Thumbs up !

51907,1,"The Struggle for Revolutionary Culture Trotsky once wrote that of the three great tragedies in life- hunger , sex and death- revolutionary Marxism , which was the driving force behind his life and work , mainly concerned itself with the struggle against hunger . That observation contains an essential truth about the central thrust of the Marxist tradition . However , as Trotsky demonstrates here , Marxist methodology can not and should not be reduced to an analysis of and prescription for that single struggle . Here Trotsky takes on an aspect of the struggle for mass cultural development . In a healthy post - capitalist society mass cultural development would be greatly expanded and encouraged . If the task of socialism were merely to vastly expand economic equality , in a sense , it would be a relativity simple task for a healthy socialist society in concert with other like - minded societies to provide general economic equality with a little tweaking after vanquishing the capitalism mode of production . What Marxism aimed for , and Trotsky defends here , is a prospect that with the end of class society and economic and social injustice the capacity of individual human beings to reach new heights of intellectual and creative development would flourish . That is the thought that underpins Trotsky 's work here as he analyzes various trends in Russian literature in the immediate aftermath of the October Revolution of 1917 . In short , Marxism is certainly not a method to be followed in order to write great literature but it does allow one to set that literature in its social context and interrelatedness . You will find no Deconstructionist or other fashionable literary criticism here . Quite the contrary . Here Trotsky uses his finely tuned skill as a Marxist to great effect as he analyzes the various trends of literature as they were affected ( or not affected ) by the October Revolution and sniffs out what in false in some of the literary trends . Mainly at the time of writing the jury was still out about the prospects of many of these trends . He analyzes many of the trends that became important later in the century in world literature , like futurism and constructivism , and others- some of which have disappeared and some of which still survive . The most important and lasting polemic which Trotsky raised here , however , was the fight against the proponents of ` proletarian culture ' . The argument put forth by this trend maintained that since the Soviet Union was a workers state those who wrote about working class themes or were workers themselves should in the interest of cultural development be given special status and encouragement ( read a monopoly on the literary front ) . Trotsky makes short shrift of this argument by noting that , in theory at least as its turned out , the proletarian state was only a transitional state and therefore no lasting ` proletarian culture ' would have time to develop . Although history did not turn out to prove Trotsky correct the polemic is still relevant to any theory of mass cultural development . One of the results of the publication of this book is that many intellectuals , particularly Western intellectuals , based some of their sympathy for Trotsky the man and fallen hero on his literary analysis and his ability to write . This was particularly true during the 1930 's here in America where those who were anti - Stalinist but were repelled by the vacuity of the Socialist Party were drawn to him . A few , like James T. Farrell ( Studs Lonigan trilogy ) , did this mostly honorably . Most , like Dwight MacDonald and Sidney Hooks , etc . did not and simply used that temporary sympathy as a way station on their way to anti - Communism . Such is the nature of the political struggle . A note for the politically- inclined who read this book . Trotsky wrote this book in 1923 - 24 at the time of Lenin 's death and later while the struggle for succession by Stalin , Zinoviev and Kamenev was in full swing . While Trotsky did not recognize it until later ( nor did others , for that matter ) this period represented the closing of the rising tide of the revolution . Hereafter , the people who ruled the Soviet Union , the purposes for which they ruled and the manner in which they ruled changed dramatically . In short , Thermidor in the classical French revolutionary expression was victorious . Given his political position why the hell was he writing a book on literary trends in post - revolutionary society at that time .",806,1,0.13322102364038263,0.00024691358024694037,0.00024691358024694037,0.00024691358024694037,0.05972608838285496,0.00024691358024694037,0.012592592639337074,0.22638605034383832,0.00024691358024694037,0.00024691358024694037,0.00024691358024694037,0.00024691358024694037,0.05966667376377151,0.00024691358024694037,0.00024691358024694037,0.00024691358024694037,0.00024691358024694037,0.00024691358024694037,0.00024691358024694037,0.00024691358024694037,0.00024691358024694037,0.00024691358024694037,0.00024691358024694037,0.00024691358024694037,0.00024691358024694037,0.01274890681432459,0.08576133459450369,0.00024691358024694037,0.00024691358024694037,0.06082411892027565,0.00024691358024694037,0.00024691358024694037,0.00024691358024694037,0.00024691358024694037,0.00024691358024694037,0.02330310339212492,0.3158935642987092,0.00024691358024694037,0.00024691358024694037,0.00024691358024694037,0.00024691358024694037,0.00024691358024694037,0.00024691358024694037,0.00024691358024694037,0.00024691358024694037,0.00024691358024694037,0.00024691358024694037,0.00024691358024694037,0.00024691358024694037,0.00024691358024694037,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Tales shows how four companies - a long - distance call center ; a hospital neural - renal unit , a car dealership and a roofing company - have applied Fish ! theories effectively . They also provide short examples from other companies to show how well the Fish ! function . The four main principles are familiar by now - keep the work fun , seek to serve others , stay focused on your customers and have an enthusiastic attitude - but the examples in the book bring them alive . Along the way , the authors heavily sell their Fish ! courses and merchandise - that 's just good salesmanship - but the real catch of the day is the final how - to section , showing ways to apply these principles in any organization .

51952,1,"Mostly true , except for the information from McNamara People were looking for a book that could grab them about Nam when this was a best seller in 1972 , and this book has details that people were not getting from television or the front page of newspapers in those days . Magazines that published book reviews typically had a view of Nam that was tuned more to the nuance of individual points of view than the geopolitical justifications which failed to consider the nature of the situation in Nam itself as a primary consideration . Portions of this book originally appeared in ` The New Yorker , ' so the author was becoming widely known as this book was being prepared . Frances FitzGerald 's original trip to Vietnam was in February to November of 1966 , and resulted in articles for the ` Atlantic Monthly , ' the ` Village Voice , ' ` Vogue , ' etc . People who read fashion magazines were particularly interested in what a nice girl might think of a situation like Nam , where large numbers of young Americans were being subjected to a military view of the situation on a personal level so intense that most publications would refrain from printing the kind of expressions which naturally describe the emotional shock of being shot at or booby trapped in some more surprising fashion . This book is not perfect . The only listing for ` Tonkin Gulf Resolution ' in the index is for the page on which President Johnson 's use of the Resolution is questioned by Senator Fulbright in 1966 . That was the time this book is mainly concerned with , but it gives an enormous amount of background information . It is possible to find a listing in the index under ` GVN ' for ` and U.S. entry into the war , 354 ' which gives the page that reflects Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara 's testimony to Congress that:""It was in response to an amphibious sabotage raid by GVN forces that North Vietnamese PT boats attacked the U.S. destroyer Maddox , mistaking it for one of the South Vietnamese vessels . "" ( pp . 352 - 353).Actually , the OPLAN 34A attacks along the Gulf of Tonkin coastline were operations planned and approved in Washington , D.C. , and McNamara lied about South Vietnamese operations to maintain the secret status of U.S. operations , during which the North Vietnamese PT boats were responding to recoilless rifle fire from a small boat when American intelligence informed the Maddox that it was about to be attacked . Radio intercepts of North Vietnamese naval messages on August 4 , 1964 , were used to convince LBJ and Senators that an attack had occurred when two American destroyers were picking up radar ghosts and sonar readings off the reflection of a hard - turned rudder , as shown by subsequent tests . Edwin E. Moise 's book , TONKIN GULF AND THE ESCALATION OF THE VIETNAM WAR has much more information about that secret circus stunt . Jeffrey Kimball 's recent book , THE VIETNAM WAR FILES : UNCOVERING THE SECRET HISTORY OF NIXON - ERA STRATEGY , contains a reference to the author of this book in a Memorandum by Dwight Chapin to Haldeman , January 18 , 1973 , about a month after heavy bombing near or in Hanoi to get some ceasefire agreement signed , hoping it could be called ` The Peace Announcement ' ( p. 288 ) and attempting to describe a point of view different from what intellectuals were expecting . ""The FitzGeralds and the Fondas , the Halberstams and Harrimans , the Clarks and Ellsbergs and Baezes are poised in the wings just waiting to treat the end of the war as their victory and to so opine from coast to coast . "" ( Kimball , p. 291).I have the First Vintage Books Edition , August 1973 , which was after Dwight Chapin 's Memorandum , but I am not sure if American bombing in Cambodia had ended when the actual paper in this book was printed on . There are only six lines of listings in the index for Cambodia , mostly on general issues , but the week I spent there was hardly earth - shaking . Of more interest to me was the report in FIRE IN THE LAKE about the An Lao valley , where the battalion 1/12th Infantry from the 4th Infantry Division spent the months from September , 1969 to January , 1970 . I believe this was our first free fire zone , with a base high above a village that had been destroyed , surrounded by paddies in which elephant grass was growing instead of rice , but enemy soldiers were found harvesting highland rice on the hillsides . Enemy contact was the only kind we had , after all other possibilities had been eliminated in the manner described in this book . ""In Operation Masher / White Wing alone -- a multi - regimental sweep through the north of Binh Dinh province -- the Allied forces , by the estimates , destroyed an entire enemy division . In the process they left hundreds of civilians dead and wounded and ` generated ' so many refugees as almost to depopulate the fertile An Loa valley . "" ( p. 405).""While the American troops opened roads and ` cleared ' great stretches of territory , the Front guerrillas came back into every area except those heavily garrisoned by U.S. troops . By the end of 1966 the NLF continued to govern the An Lao valley as well as the suburbs of Da Nang , Hue , Nha Trang , and Saigon .

51956,1,"Self Help Masterpiece I was so impressed with this book that I wrote the following letter to its author : I just completed your book Time Tactics of Very Successful People . The book is truly a masterpiece , and I have found it immeasurably helpful in my ongoing pursuit to become the best person that I can be . Your book is full of wisdom and great ideas , the value of which is many times the price I paid for the book . I have read the works of personal development legends like Napoleon Hill , Brian Tracy , W. Clement Stone , Tony Robbins , Mark Victor Hansen and others and have benefited from all of them , but I really enjoyed reading your book because I found that you offered some fresh ideas that these other great men did not . I am sure that the extraordinary concepts your book provides will enrich my spirit , enlighten my mind , and serve as conduits for achieving my goals for the rest of my life . I really liked the way that you ended the book . The quote you gave from Earl Nightengale perfectly reflects my philosophy for successful living , but helped me crystallize my thinking in a way that has helped refines my philosophy further . Thanks again for providing the world such a valuable resource , a guide which I am certain has helped and will continue to help many others to live happier , more productive , and more peaceful lives .",260,1,0.0004347826086956842,0.0004347826086956842,0.0004347826086956842,0.0004347826086956842,0.1368369866457683,0.0004347826086956842,0.0004347826086956842,0.23279008006948704,0.0004347826086956842,0.0004347826086956842,0.0004347826086956842,0.0004347826086956842,0.0004347826086956842,0.0004347826086956842,0.0004347826086956842,0.0004347826086956842,0.0004347826086956842,0.0004347826086956842,0.0004347826086956842,0.0004347826086956842,0.0004347826086956842,0.06655495257982894,0.0004347826086956842,0.0004347826086956842,0.0004347826086956842,0.0004347826086956842,0.0004347826086956842,0.0004347826086956842,0.0004347826086956842,0.0004347826086956842,0.0004347826086956842,0.0004347826086956842,0.0004347826086956842,0.0004347826086956842,0.032544491108615216,0.0004347826086956842,0.5117082722049947,0.0004347826086956842,0.0004347826086956842,0.0004347826086956842,0.0004347826086956842,0.0004347826086956842,0.0004347826086956842,0.0004347826086956842,0.0004347826086956842,0.0004347826086956842,0.0004347826086956842,0.0004347826086956842,0.0004347826086956842,0.0004347826086956842,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

51977,1,"A MASTERFUL CONTRIBUTION Some previous reviewers have complained about the complex style and writing of this book . Although in fact it is not an easily readable book , for the general public , if you have a serious interest about the history of the third Reich , make no mistake : you will not be able to overlook this book , which will surely be a classic . It is a thoroughly well researched contribution about the connection between religious beliefs and mass fanaticism ; the interaction between the "" new "" domestic and international values , based on aggression ; and the other causes involved in the rise ( and fall ) of the III Reich . From a different perspective from other mainstream historians , this winner of the Samuel Johnson prize for non fiction , has accomplished quite an original scholarly feat , one which will enlighten the comprehension of this particular period of history . No wonder many international critics have found the subtitle of this opus -A new History- particularly well deserved . Of great interest is the chapter related with the demise of the rule of law , a thorough analysis of the penetration of the judiciary and the subordination of the police and government to the totalitarian Fuhrerprinzip",216,1,0.0008333333333334198,0.10826709643062837,0.0008333333333334198,0.0008333333333334198,0.08370379204028773,0.0008333333333334198,0.0008333333333334198,0.0008333333333334198,0.0008333333333334198,0.0008333333333334198,0.0008333333333334198,0.0008333333333334198,0.0008333333333334198,0.0008333333333334198,0.0008333333333334198,0.0008333333333334198,0.0008333333333334198,0.0008333333333334198,0.0008333333333334198,0.0008333333333334198,0.0008333333333334198,0.0008333333333334198,0.0008333333333334198,0.0008333333333334198,0.0008333333333334198,0.0008333333333334198,0.10165774187449943,0.0008333333333334198,0.0008333333333334198,0.0008333333333334198,0.0008333333333334198,0.15971536099398417,0.0008333333333334198,0.0008333333333334198,0.0008333333333334198,0.0008333333333334198,0.27461104211817744,0.0008333333333334198,0.06392521642928771,0.0008333333333334198,0.0008333333333334198,0.0008333333333334198,0.0008333333333334198,0.07876562982131821,0.09435412029181323,0.0008333333333334198,0.0008333333333334198,0.0008333333333334198,0.0008333333333334198,0.0008333333333334198,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0

51995,1,"Good info , but missing a certain something ... Overall this book is just fine for someone interested in cooking with a DO . The mix of recipes is fine , but they just seemed to be missing something . They were all more or less of the quot;huck a good sized hen into the pot and cook for a while until done quot ; variety . All of the recipes look tasty , though I would have liked to have seen a few more meat dishes , especially some more creative ones . Let 's be honest , when you pay for a book you 'd like to see more than quot; ... put a 5 lb beef roast into a preheated Dutch oven , salt and pepper to taste , cook until done . quot ; Give me a little something to work with here ! Inspire me ! I can already cook a roast like this in the oven . Having said all of that , I would still reccommend this book . The vegetable dishes and desserts look fantastic and I ca n't wait to try some of them . As an aside , this is the only Dutch oven book I 've seen with heart - healthy recipes as well as more traditional fare . Given that the average DO book requires the use of a metric ton of lard , this will probably appeal to a wider range of cooks",246,1,0.2324030755467405,0.04515145614400438,0.04304921461229074,0.0004651162790697986,0.0004651162790697986,0.0004651162790697986,0.0004651162790697986,0.0004651162790697986,0.0004651162790697986,0.0004651162790697986,0.0004651162790697986,0.0004651162790697986,0.19591140911827373,0.0004651162790697986,0.0004651162790697986,0.0004651162790697986,0.0004651162790697986,0.0004651162790697986,0.0004651162790697986,0.0004651162790697986,0.0004651162790697986,0.11672502096160105,0.0004651162790697986,0.0004651162790697986,0.0004651162790697986,0.0004651162790697986,0.0004651162790697986,0.0004651162790697986,0.0004651162790697986,0.0004651162790697986,0.0004651162790697986,0.0004651162790697986,0.0004651162790697986,0.0004651162790697986,0.030616064894946244,0.0004651162790697986,0.13992077620444057,0.09348837209302878,0.06423415931630584,0.0004651162790697986,0.0004651162790697986,0.0004651162790697986,0.0004651162790697986,0.0004651162790697986,0.0004651162790697986,0.0004651162790697986,0.01989579994557611,0.0004651162790697986,0.0004651162790697986,0.0004651162790697986,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

"" did not fly either , my machine is a media type and it far exceeds the system requirements advertised by ADS . I exchanged the item and it was supposedly checked out before I got it . Same problems . Tech support told me I was the only person having trouble with this product . They need to check out a few websites that review products there are hundreds of bad reviews very few good ones . My only mistake was not reading them before I wasted my time and money . ADS also told me it would not work with Ulead 's Movie Factory 3 , some of the software it came bundled with , but that was Uleads problem . I should use Cap Wiz ( Their program ) DUH ! ! ! Guess what , it did not work with their program either . Ulead said they had several complaints with ADS 's product . Their final solution hold on to the product and maybe they will have a new version of cap wiz and that might work . Save yourself time money and aggravation buy another product ! P.S. Since ADS does n't consider the product defective they will not refund your money or allow you trade it in for an upgrade . I do n't think they want a product like that either .

52050,2,"Short - lived machine -- avoid this lemon Here is the original review of this machine I wrote on June 17 , 2006 : We bought this machine just over a year ago ( a year and two weeks , to be specific ) . We had another very similar Panasonic DVD recorder ( DMR - E55 ) in a different room and wanted to be able to record and watch DVD - RAMs on both . For a long time , the ES10S recorder worked fine . Recently , though , it has begun making noises when starting up and shutting down , and now it occasionally has problems reading the disks , ejecting them , and even playing them . At first we thought this might be because we 'd recorded over the DVD - RAMs so many times . But today we tested one of them in the other machine , which has never made any similar noises , and the E55 had no problems with it . Needless to say , we 're not happy that the ES10S seems to be dying , especially since the 1-year warranty just ended . If you buy or own this machine , follow up on any strange noises as soon as you hear them if you 're within the warranty period , because the noises and problems just get worse . Panasonic is usually a reliable brand , one we 've used for many years , but this machine seems to be a lemon . We 're actually going to write to Panasonic about it -- I'll try to post again with the results . Here is my update , which I wrote November 3 : This is a follow - up review to the one above , which I wrote on June 17 . I wrote to Panasonic after my machine had stopped working just after the warranty ended . They sent me a nice letter authorizing a free repair , including labor , of the machine at one of three places they listed . The places were all within a half - hour drive of my home . After doing some research , I chose one and brought in the machine . They fixed it by replacing "" the entire internal mechanism "" ( I do n't know what that means ) . We got the machine back from the repair shop near the end of July ; it 's now the beginning of November . The fixed machine worked fine for a while , but in the past few weeks , we 've been hearing the same old noises that were the beginning of the end for it before . I 'm going to try writing to Panasonic again and asking for a refund , because this machine really seems to have something fundamentally wrong with it . It 's still working , but I know from the last time with these noises and efforts to read the disks that soon it wo n't . Avoid this machine . Again , the previous Panasonic model ( DMR - E55 ) we bought has n't had any of these difficulties and continues to work great . We 're still big Panasonic fans , but this particular model is a lemon .",554,0,0.0001904761904762115,0.03847151393945875,0.0001904761904762115,0.05282074972276337,0.15659007387253088,0.0001904761904762115,0.0001904761904762115,0.0001904761904762115,0.0001904761904762115,0.0001904761904762115,0.0001904761904762115,0.0001904761904762115,0.0779793334223108,0.0001904761904762115,0.00971408814348511,0.0001904761904762115,0.0001904761904762115,0.08143676580028475,0.0001904761904762115,0.0001904761904762115,0.0001904761904762115,0.0001904761904762115,0.0001904761904762115,0.07140967447579116,0.022866774668043117,0.0001904761904762115,0.0001904761904762115,0.0001904761904762115,0.0168424137236461,0.0001904761904762115,0.0001904761904762115,0.0001904761904762115,0.024503132547546304,0.0001904761904762115,0.0001904761904762115,0.0001904761904762115,0.02746793338693647,0.0001904761904762115,0.05767775613894079,0.0001904761904762115,0.08235565844319483,0.00972803143615927,0.03391860820792331,0.0001904761904762115,0.1620100458364873,0.06792173194878287,0.0001904761904762115,0.0001904761904762115,0.0001904761904762115,0.0001904761904762115,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0

52060,2,"Good system - one huge flaw This is a good product - sounds great , gets good battery life , everything you 'd hope for in an iPod dock . But it has one major flaw . The iPod docking port is really flimsy , and has no structural support aside from the actual electronics themselves . After a little bit of use , the connection between the iPod and the dock deteriorated to the point that the volume fluctuated up and down , and sometimes the sound cuts out all together . If they added some kind of simple support so that bumping the iPod would n't stress the electronics , I 'd give this thing 5 stars . But without that , it simply breaks quickly , and no longer performs its only job - to sound good .",141,0,0.2829645455844833,0.0005882352941176967,0.056810779663666516,0.0005882352941176967,0.04938277146642861,0.0005882352941176967,0.0005882352941176967,0.0005882352941176967,0.0005882352941176967,0.0005882352941176967,0.0707787356885203,0.0005882352941176967,0.0005882352941176967,0.0005882352941176967,0.0005882352941176967,0.0005882352941176967,0.12693202871935724,0.0005882352941176967,0.0005882352941176967,0.0005882352941176967,0.0005882352941176967,0.0005882352941176967,0.12693695643274244,0.0005882352941176967,0.0005882352941176967,0.0005882352941176967,0.0005882352941176967,0.0005882352941176967,0.2099601092469096,0.0005882352941176967,0.0005882352941176967,0.0005882352941176967,0.0005882352941176967,0.0005882352941176967,0.0005882352941176967,0.0005882352941176967,0.0005882352941176967,0.0005882352941176967,0.0005882352941176967,0.0005882352941176967,0.0005882352941176967,0.0005882352941176967,0.0005882352941176967,0.0005882352941176967,0.051528190844948724,0.0005882352941176967,0.0005882352941176967,0.0005882352941176967,0.0005882352941176967,0.0005882352941176967,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

52073,2,"Good potential , but nasty The Tomtom has great features . But I returned mine . First , the maps are very dated . This makes it iffy at best . It has terrific potential , if it worked . You can use a PDA stylus on the map sitting at home outside on batteries to plan a trip . It 's amazing . But I wanted to plan a 600 mile trip myself using it 's internal maps and waypoints . But I tried a local test first . I used roads as waypoints , main roads . This way I can force the Tomtom to use MY routes . I did not like it 's choices , since it is a dated map database . I set up a local route , and started to follow it . It took me to the first road / waypoint no problem . But it would not go past the first waypoint . I would go down the road ( first waypoint ) then it would tell me to take a u turn ! . I did . Then it said take another u turn . It had me going in circles . Perhaps it 's not made to use roads as waypoints , but all indications it gave were that it would . The manual was no help . Support was no help . So it went back . I have ordered a Garmin i2 . Hope this is ok . I have taken the same trip from SE FL USA to SC USA with a Garmin C330 . The Garmin has maps that you can not update , but got me to my destination no problem . I do n't recommend this TomTom . Do research . Go to manufactures websites and look at unit manuals .

52076,2,"Love affair gone sour I have owned this little hub for at least a year . I have an older PC which came without USB , so I added a PCI adapter . I soon realized that I needed more ports , and more convenience , than the two now located in the backplane of the PC on the floor . I shopped around , and this item looked appropriate . As for the short cord , I solved that issue by getting a USB extension cord at the same time . Besides solving the immediate problem , this approach gave me the option of moving the hub to my laptop at some point , and using the extension cord for some other purpose . For a long time it did exactly what it was supposed to do . I attached an external hard drive through it . I used it for a compact flash card reader , and a digital camera . I connected an inkjet printer . Everything worked , once the drivers were installed and everything was set up correctly . ( This was all with Windows 98 SE.)But after a while , things started getting less reliable . The system would tell me that various "" drives "" ( on the flash card reader , or the external hard drive ) were not available . Or the digital camera would not stay connected to its software . And the printer even started disappearing . Playing with the cables and connectors would sometimes bring devices back to life , and eventually I deduced that there was something wrong either with the connectors themselves being too loose , or with wiring inside the device . Either way , it has finally become a big problem , and I am shopping for a replacement . Most of the devices I connected were self - powered , that is , they did not need to draw power from the hub or the PCI channel at all . The hard drive , camera , and printer were all powered by batteries or AC adapters of their own . And the flash card reader , which did draw power from the hub , used to work fine . It does not matter what combination of devices I try , sooner or later the connection goes bad . It is of course possible that there 's something wrong in the PC -- but that would not explain why things are improved by messing with the connectors or the hub itself . So I have to recommend against buying it . I suspect it is discontinued and that this advice wo n't be necessary for much longer , but I want to prevent somebody from the bother I 've been through , just in case",471,0,0.0002439024390244194,0.04409182625779438,0.0002439024390244194,0.0002439024390244194,0.0002439024390244194,0.0002439024390244194,0.0002439024390244194,0.04040325278579728,0.0002439024390244194,0.0002439024390244194,0.0002439024390244194,0.0002439024390244194,0.1543629563509063,0.0002439024390244194,0.013249658122986537,0.0002439024390244194,0.034576407715661964,0.0002439024390244194,0.012439024390243785,0.0002439024390244194,0.0002439024390244194,0.0002439024390244194,0.08664533841135806,0.0002439024390244194,0.0002439024390244194,0.0380159840445664,0.0002439024390244194,0.0002439024390244194,0.0002439024390244194,0.0002439024390244194,0.0002439024390244194,0.0002439024390244194,0.0002439024390244194,0.0002439024390244194,0.0002439024390244194,0.0002439024390244194,0.06605736816898945,0.0002439024390244194,0.07602173265280579,0.0002439024390244194,0.03804481247806552,0.06202911867540501,0.0002439024390244194,0.0002439024390244194,0.06486374810184779,0.13222346937808313,0.1284387170996341,0.0002439024390244194,0.0002439024390244194,0.0002439024390244194,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0
52086,2,Very unhappy with this purchase I bought this same brand of discs sometime last year on this very site . I was very pleased with the purchase then . I did n't have one problem with the discs . I bought another pack recently and I 've been using the pack I just bought . All of the discs are messing up for me . I can understand having a few problematic discs but this is insane to have a whole pack of discs and every single one of them messes up for you . I wish I could send these discs back and get a refund . This purchase has scared me away from anything else related to Memorex . I thought Memorex was a very reliable brand and they would make sure they were sending out top notch items to consumers . I guess I was wrong . And apparently you get what you pay for . Do n't be fooled by the good price . You 'll just be out of your money and stuck with discs that would n't even be worth using as a frisbee . Find another brand to use and avoid this brand,200,0,0.0005555555555555911,0.0005555555555555911,0.0005555555555555911,0.11369507180390503,0.0005555555555555911,0.0005555555555555911,0.0005555555555555911,0.0005555555555555911,0.0005555555555555911,0.0005555555555555911,0.0005555555555555911,0.0005555555555555911,0.18829874965457766,0.0005555555555555911,0.0005555555555555911,0.0005555555555555911,0.05907742991051236,0.22873755103289103,0.0005555555555555911,0.0005555555555555911,0.0005555555555555911,0.0005555555555555911,0.03777899770412492,0.0005555555555555911,0.0005555555555555911,0.0005555555555555911,0.0005555555555555911,0.0005555555555555911,0.134493809588696,0.0005555555555555911,0.0005555555555555911,0.0005555555555555911,0.0005555555555555911,0.0005555555555555911,0.0005555555555555911,0.0005555555555555911,0.0005555555555555911,0.0005555555555555911,0.0005555555555555911,0.13707073936821457,0.0005555555555555911,0.0005555555555555911,0.0005555555555555911,0.0005555555555555911,0.0005555555555555911,0.0005555555555555911,0.07751431760374357,0.0005555555555555911,0.0005555555555555911,0.0005555555555555911,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

52113,2,"Stops working after 3 months This DVD player does play all types of DVDs no matter how you burn it . But like other reviews , it stopped working after 3 - 6 months . In my case , it was 3 months . It just does n't turn on anymore . I unplugged everything and replugged it but it just went dead . I do n't watch DVDs much , so it 's not like I overused it . Go with another model . This one has problems . I thought mines would be the exception , but I guess not . And now I ca n't return it because it 's been over 30 days .",118,0,0.0006666666666667269,0.0006666666666667269,0.06351869380285284,0.09035724232176806,0.0006666666666667269,0.0006666666666667269,0.0006666666666667269,0.0006666666666667269,0.03479349822269043,0.0006666666666667269,0.0006666666666667269,0.0006666666666667269,0.0006666666666667269,0.0006666666666667269,0.0006666666666667269,0.0006666666666667269,0.20901351221094236,0.1927735913587423,0.03381821609479872,0.02380616553908238,0.0006666666666667269,0.0006666666666667269,0.0006666666666667269,0.0006666666666667269,0.0006666666666667269,0.0006666666666667269,0.06345981701247588,0.0006666666666667269,0.0006666666666667269,0.0006666666666667269,0.0006666666666667269,0.0006666666666667269,0.0006666666666667269,0.0006666666666667269,0.0006666666666667269,0.0006666666666667269,0.0006666666666667269,0.0006666666666667269,0.0006666666666667269,0.052611767105839896,0.0006666666666667269,0.0006666666666667269,0.16901065816261887,0.0006666666666667269,0.0006666666666667269,0.04083683816818594,0.0006666666666667269,0.0006666666666667269,0.0006666666666667269,0.0006666666666667269,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

52136,2,"All setup as described here , UNIT NOT STABLE . After reading the detailed reports here for how to setup this Linksys gaming adapter unit , everything worked great for several days . I setup the fixed IPs , and all the rest of the settings through the web interface , all seemed well . Note : I 'm a network engineer , so the dual - fixed - ip recommendation [ one for each segment ] is actually pretty normal in other network bridging appliances . I suspect the MS game adapter simply performs the DHCP handshake better than this unit and that is why it is so easy to setup . Then the weird stuff started . After having had this unit turned on for several days , I notice the connection would become slow and not quite as fast as when the Linksys is first turned on . Yet , the XBOX still shows the signal between 48 and 54 Mbps . Strange . I have reproduced this several times , booting the linksys device , then playing all kinds of games online for hours , running XBMC and playing media through the network perfectly . All is good for several hours , but come back the next day after leaving the Linksys on all day / night , turn on the XBOX , and the network connection is spotty again , but the link details show a full speed connection in the XBOX wireless interface details . A swift power cycle of the Linksys unit solves the problem immediately , but why should I need to do this ? I suspect some NIC buffer is being filled on the Linksys and the power cycle clears out the unit 's network buffers . If anyone has figured out what settings to use to keep this thing stable , I am ready to listen , maybe I should select a G - only network and set the speed at 54 or 48 fixed , maybe that will work ? Anyway , I am getting tired of power cycling this thing every day .

52143,2,"Needs Significant Improvement I replaced a Siemens 8825 with the Motorola 7081 and was , unfortunately , really disappointed . The 8825 while rich in function , is quite lacking in quality . So what 's good about the 7081 is:1 . Great design and feel , especially the handset.2 . Nice look to the unit.3 . Well - lit displays.4 . Easy to understand voice prompts when accessing remotely.5 . Reasonable range.6 . Nice feel to the buttons.7 . Fairly easy to go through the setup.8 . Ability to sort the phonebook alphabetically.9 . Base has phonebook that can be shared by the handsets.10 . Motorola customer support ( excellent).Now what 's not good:1 . Even at maximum volume , you can barely hear the speakerphone on the base.2 . Sound on the handset is distorted , fuzzy . The person on the other end hears a hiss . The volume is adequate , but barely.3 . Can not search the phonebook . If you sorted it alphabetically and need to access a name starting with "" Z "" you have to scroll through the entire phonebook.4 . Ca n't record an outgoing message remotely.5 . Battery level indicator on handset is useless . When the handset is in the charging cradle , it shows a charging indication at all times . When it is out of the cradle , it does n't show anything . I really wanted to like this unit because it has such a nice look and feel to it but the poor sound quality is a showstopper .",264,0,0.19724471951784142,0.20150921174274924,0.07793822302763044,0.028571413560279653,0.021966884386712775,0.00040816326530615347,0.00040816326530615347,0.00040816326530615347,0.050895847731090633,0.00040816326530615347,0.00040816326530615347,0.00040816326530615347,0.00040816326530615347,0.00040816326530615347,0.0208163265306112,0.00040816326530615347,0.12467733268086369,0.00040816326530615347,0.00040816326530615347,0.00040816326530615347,0.00040816326530615347,0.00040816326530615347,0.1186657649257223,0.00040816326530615347,0.00040816326530615347,0.00040816326530615347,0.00040816326530615347,0.00040816326530615347,0.04381834714101847,0.00040816326530615347,0.00040816326530615347,0.00040816326530615347,0.00040816326530615347,0.00040816326530615347,0.00040816326530615347,0.00040816326530615347,0.00040816326530615347,0.00040816326530615347,0.05807101513481431,0.00040816326530615347,0.00040816326530615347,0.00040816326530615347,0.00040816326530615347,0.00040816326530615347,0.00040816326530615347,0.00040816326530615347,0.04031470953903203,0.00040816326530615347,0.00040816326530615347,0.00040816326530615347,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
52144,2,"Unacceptable I have had this phone for 20 hours - and am returning it . There is static noise on the line when people talk on the other end . The echo of my voice from the earpiece is very distracting - I find it very disconcerting . The wall mount bracket causes the base to stick straight out from the wall - and as a previous reviewer mentioned , is usually up to your nose given the location of most wall mounts . This strikes me as an unexcusable oversight on Motorola 's part . Either make it desk only - or do the wall mount right . The speaker for the speakerphone feature is in the back of the phone - while the microphone is in the front of the phone . Dumb design - I feel like I 'm either not listening or not being picked up when talking . The volume on the base speakerphone is too low at highest setting . I'm very disappointed in this phone .

52159,2,"Metal stablized system ... On the back of the package it says - 1 ) Transparent sound and powerful bass . - The "" Transparent sound "" part is true and "" powerful bass "" part is totally untrue . 2 ) Metal stabilized system for high levels . - What was that again ? Metal stabilized system ? ? It has antiroll crossbars I guess!!When companies start making vague claims about their product - that s when you know that there is a problem . These sounded terrible at first - no bass - period . The sound changed for the better once I put on the foam covers . I could hear some bass at that point but even after equalization , it was clear that this product is designed to deliver a lot of high frequency , decent midrange but little by way of bass - even though it claims to have frequency response going from 18Hz to 20kHz . It fits my ears properly , so that is not a problem . This product sounds far inferior to a pair of "" Aiwa "" ear - buds that came with a "" Made in Japan "" walkman purchased in 1990!I would n't even compare the sound of these MX400 to the excellent Koss over the ear headphones I purchased recently . Maybe they are better than the IPOD headphones ( which suck even worse ) , and the reason people give this 5 stars . Really - no more than a 2 star product . Expected much better from Sennheiser . With this experience , I 've decided not to go for their noise cancelling headphone and instead go with the one from Panasonic .

52172,2,"Good sound ... SUCKS for iPOD ! ! ! The ONLY reason i bought this unit when I saw it in the store was for the iPod controller feature . I really looked forward to being able to control my iPod from the deck and hiding my ipod in my dash completely out of sight . Boy was I disappointed ! The iPod adpater works and all ... but barely . It takes FOREVER to scroll through the songs , artists or albums . Why the hell would Alpine put out a product that has an inferior scrolling mechanism and then lock you out of the iPod so you ca n't even select songs from the iPod itself ? I have over 3000 songs on my iPod ... by the time I scroll to the song I want I 've already reached my destination ... and that 's if I even find the song at all ! So now what I have to do is unplug my iPod , scroll to the song I want , then plug it back in . ( Luckily the reciever continues to play whatever song was already playing when you plug your iPod in . ) But again ... that defeats the whole point of having the controls built into the deck . Bottom line , the iPod control feature flat SUCKS . The deck features a "" quick search "" function ... but it is uselss ... it is n't used to search through artsts or albums ... only individual songs and there 's no way to skip 10 , 20 , 30 or 100 songs at a time ... only 1 by 1 ... What 's "" quick "" about that ? I have 3000 songs and hundreds of artists and albums and Alpine thinks I 'm supposed to go through them 1 by 1 ? ? ? ? Another annoying thing about this unit is that when you skip through songs while the iPod is playing , the display just says "" song up "" or "" song down "" instead of just showing the name of the damn song ! Who thought of that ? What possible help could "" song up "" be to anyone ? Just show the name of the song while I 'm skipping through ... that makes more sense right ? There are a bunch of other problems I have with the practicalness of this unit when used with the iPod adapter and iPod ... but the sound quality is great which is the most important thing ... but then again ... who cares if the sound is great when it takes you all day to find the song you want to listen to",459,0,0.23810863221644976,0.0002531645569620466,0.014387627510746024,0.03987998747277543,0.03362260871213151,0.0002531645569620466,0.0002531645569620466,0.0002531645569620466,0.013711058534922545,0.0002531645569620466,0.010724002657311871,0.0002531645569620466,0.14608136586808101,0.0002531645569620466,0.0002531645569620466,0.0002531645569620466,0.0002531645569620466,0.0002531645569620466,0.025555030371253132,0.0002531645569620466,0.0002531645569620466,0.0002531645569620466,0.07246667770787571,0.0002531645569620466,0.014709836579428533,0.0002531645569620466,0.0002531645569620466,0.0002531645569620466,0.2860446374398333,0.0002531645569620466,0.0002531645569620466,0.0002531645569620466,0.0002531645569620466,0.0002531645569620466,0.0002531645569620466,0.0002531645569620466,0.0002531645569620466,0.0002531645569620466,0.0002531645569620466,0.09508828176463346,0.0002531645569620466,0.0002531645569620466,0.0002531645569620466,0.0002531645569620466,0.0002531645569620466,0.0002531645569620466,0.0002531645569620466,0.0002531645569620466,0.0002531645569620466,0.0002531645569620466,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
52178,2,"Do n't Buy this Ink Hog Do n't even accept it as a freebie ( as I did ) unless you are prepared to pay $ 1.15 per sheet for color ink . That was my experience with the first color cartridge , which was fully consumed on a total of 20 sheets , 12 of which were heavy color , the others being mixed color and text or very light color . At $ 17.99 per color cartridge and $ 14.99 for black I calculate the outrageous , obscene $ 1.15 per sheet figure for ink . This is about six times greater than the average ink cost for my old HP720c , which unfortunately does not work with my new HP Pavilion PC ( no printer port on this model , among other issues ) . I have vowed to not purchase any HP product in the future if I can possibly avoid it . I just ordered a Canon Pixima to replace this ink hog . On the positive side , the print quality is good , speed is excellent , and color fidelity is fair .

52186,2,"Poor Macintosh Support I bought this item after seeing the almost uniformly good reviews including the one that says there is good Macintosh support . Unfortunately the player does not work well with the Macintosh . The included software often crashes and does not seem to be able to import DSS files . The software can move the files between the recorder and the computer but the files do not appear in the software window . The use interface is also fairly crude and looks as if it was ported directly from Windows 3.1 . The DS-2 appears to the finder as a standard USB disk and I have been able to copy the DSS files from the player to the compuer using the finder . It is then possible to play the DSS files by double clicking them , but it will only play one file . If you want to play another file it is necessary to completely quit the DSS player and relanch it . Exporting the files to a format usable by other software such as AIFF is also nearly impossible . There is an export function in the menu , when it is selected it asks were the new file should be saved but no file ever appears . Unfortunately there is no other Macintosh software available to read or convert DSS files as Olympus refuses to allow others use the the format on the Macintosh . Search of the internet reveals that others have found extremely painful ways of converting the DSS files such as playing the entire file and re - recording it with another program",273,0,0.0004545454545455151,0.0004545454545455151,0.06569826952165438,0.0004545454545455151,0.0004545454545455151,0.0004545454545455151,0.02318208859974487,0.0004545454545455151,0.09930343833677074,0.0004545454545455151,0.0004545454545455151,0.0004545454545455151,0.0004545454545455151,0.0004545454545455151,0.0004545454545455151,0.0004545454545455151,0.0004545454545455151,0.03990003235999935,0.023181818181819667,0.0004545454545455151,0.0004545454545455151,0.0004545454545455151,0.18471373826623017,0.0004545454545455151,0.02668309112471266,0.0004545454545455151,0.0004545454545455151,0.0004545454545455151,0.0004545454545455151,0.0004545454545455151,0.0004545454545455151,0.0004545454545455151,0.0004545454545455151,0.0004545454545455151,0.0004545454545455151,0.0004545454545455151,0.0004545454545455151,0.0004545454545455151,0.17358373957146447,0.2044616895234812,0.03393878230331641,0.0004545454545455151,0.0004545454545455151,0.0004545454545455151,0.0004545454545455151,0.0004545454545455151,0.10762603948353092,0.0004545454545455151,0.0004545454545455151,0.0004545454545455151,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

52202,2,"Disparate cord length- more than irritating . I read all of the reviews here and thought these would be the best option for easy transport AND low ambient sound i - pod headpohones without breaking the bank ( I 'm on a plane frequently ) . I wanted something that I would n't cry over breaking or losing during my many travels . I found that the uneven cord lengths are very irritating- especially if you like to use only one plug ( like maybe at your desk at work ) . The weight of the shorter cord pulls on the longer cord and it is quite uncomfortable- even when sitting still . So then I thought these will be great workout headphones ( wo n't be upset if I break or lose them ) , HOWEVER , the cords produce noise in the ear pieces everytime they rub on your clothing or your hand . The effect is very loud and disruptive to your music listening experience ( even when you are sitting stationary at your desk ) . It is similar to wearing a stethescope , which defeats the point of wearing in - the - ear headphones ( which are supposed to reduce the ambient noise ) . I do not recommend these headphones , because of this stethescope effect- I could get over the uneven cord lengths for certain uses ( they are after all designed to wear behind the head ) .

Why should I have to activate my maps if I have paid for the product ? Good question , well , I activated these maps on one PDA , and within 2 weeks my PDA died and I had to obtain warranty service . Well , I decided that I would upgrade to a new device and then sell my old device when I got it back from the manufacturers ( I tend to switch my PDA every 3 - 4 months anyway).So I installed the maps on the new device and it asked me to activate . OK , I figure ... no problem , I will be able to activate it 1 ... 2 ... 3 because after all , only I have the activation card / code .

What if I 'm a nut who likes to change PDA 's every 3 - 4 months ? What , you mean I have to show you proof that I switched ? Is n't the fact that I have the activation card proof enough ?

However - my first one lasted 3 months before it died , I then replaced it with another one and it died 3 months later as well .

52287,2,"P.O.S. I know that everyone else seems to love this , so perhaps my complaint is more about Apple in general . My Ipod Mini ( pink)is a lemon . The battery has never worked properly . It takes longer to charge than to discharge , and my current playing time per charge ( no changing settings , not backlighting , nothing but hitting play and waiting till the battery dies ) is about 2 hours . Apple will gladly sell me a new ( $ 70 ) battery , but other than that tough . It is apparently my fault thet they 're selling shoddy products . I 'm not saying do n't buy it . There are n't realistically any better choices out there than the Ipod , but buy it when you have a week to sit around and evaluate it and when they get around to opening a store near you .

I even tried using high grade color laser copier paper , but STILL double feeds big time ! Upon occasion , I get a good feed , and I am so thankful for that .

52327,2,"AWFUL . JUST AWFUL . I am shocked by the amount of positive reviews on this site . Let me tell you about my experience . I bought this machine in June of 2005 . In one year , I have replaced this machine THREE TIMES . All three times , I got error messages that the toner cartridge was out ( Toner Life End ) even when new toner cartridges were put in . I do give high marks to Brother for its customer service , though . Each time I had a problem , I called and they sent out a replacement by FedEx along with materials for me to send back the broken one . But when the fourth replacement arrived last week and I turned it on and got an immediate paper jam message , I had enough . I had a similar issue with a Brother mutlifunction machine I purchased around the same time .

52338,2,"Software and installation issues , buyer beware My family and I just relocated 3 states away from our extended family and wanted to get a good webcam to keep intouch with everyone and let our 2 year old see his grandmother once and a while . When I saw the Microsoft LifeCam at Target stores and that it was compatible with Windows Live I thought it would be worth the $ 100 price tag to be able to keep in touch with family . I purchased the software and started the installation process on my computer . Just so you know , my system is running a pentium 4 processor and has 8 active USB 2.0 connections , only 3 of which are being used for the keyboard , mouse , and this webcam , along with 512 MB of RAM which is more than necessary for this product to function . The software took about 10 minutes to install which I thought was a little odd , then it askes for you to plug in the camera . My XP system recognized the camera but told me that the hardware had encountered an error during installation and may not function properly . I uninstalled the software and tried the installation again with the same result . I then tried a different USB port just in case there was a problem . Following a stepwise process I checked and updated all drivers for the USB hub , ports , etc . and I checked under the system manager tools to ensure that all were working properly . I then went to the microsoft website and downloaded the updates for the software ( this took another 15 minutes and the site crashed twice).By now I was getting very frustrated but hoped that the software update would allow appropriate conectivity with the camera . I went into the software and found that it was recognizing the mic , but it said that there was no camera attached . I again tried to find the camera through other means with no results . For the price paid and the 3 + hours I spent trying to install the hardware I can say with all assurity that this product is not worth it . I will be returning it to Target for a full refund and will look into investing my money with another brand . As someone else said earlier in the reviews , "" does microsoft ever send their products through Quality Assurance before they release them ?",426,0,0.00027027027027028887,0.00027027027027028887,0.015277958954525172,0.03511266633166554,0.00027027027027028887,0.0681336447354314,0.01446955627388436,0.00027027027027028887,0.00027027027027028887,0.00027027027027028887,0.02723714964825183,0.00027027027027028887,0.23631223881172467,0.00027027027027028887,0.018121296939469622,0.00027027027027028887,0.0426425620792432,0.00027027027027028887,0.02729729729729844,0.00027027027027028887,0.00027027027027028887,0.00027027027027028887,0.2553928498447538,0.00027027027027028887,0.00027027027027028887,0.00027027027027028887,0.00027027027027028887,0.00027027027027028887,0.014323288205933125,0.00027027027027028887,0.00027027027027028887,0.00027027027027028887,0.00027027027027028887,0.00027027027027028887,0.00027027027027028887,0.00027027027027028887,0.00027027027027028887,0.00027027027027028887,0.00027027027027028887,0.015412116173900202,0.05026769354771457,0.00027027027027028887,0.00027027027027028887,0.00027027027027028887,0.03770324650459423,0.1328369751921499,0.00027027027027028887,0.00027027027027028887,0.00027027027027028887,0.00027027027027028887,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0

52341,2,"Break easily - even when you take care of them . In terms of sound quality , noise cancelling , and general comfort - thise headphones are top of the line . I absolutely love the way the sound and the ammount of noise cancelling that they provide . I used them regularly when mowing the lawn and when flying , and I always recieved the highest quality sound and noise cancelleation . I was even able to listen to drum - n - bass while mowing the lawn and hear all of the appropriate frequencies on the low end . However ... inside of 6 months , I have gone through 2 pairs of these headphones because the right ear headphone has gone out on them . The worst part is - I ca n't even begin to imagine why it goes out . I keep my heaphones in a locked cabinet in my office every night . Last friday , I placed back into the nice little carry bag that they come with , and placed them into this cabinet . This morning when I pulled them out for use , the right ear bud is out again ... no physical damage is apparent anywhere on the headphones , and there is not a broken wire anywhere . In fact , the wiring is perfectly fine and still functional . It is the physical earbud - the hard plastic peice - that has gone out . If i squeeze the earbud hard enough , it will turn on again . Something inside of the earbud is obviously designed improperly and I would highly recommend that noone purchase these headphones because of this",284,0,0.23900320371137163,0.15760621459627655,0.05008554194675418,0.03697491945138613,0.0004651162790698082,0.0004651162790698082,0.0004651162790698082,0.0004651162790698082,0.0004651162790698082,0.0004651162790698082,0.0004651162790698082,0.04576019767068892,0.0004651162790698082,0.0004651162790698082,0.0004651162790698082,0.0004651162790698082,0.0004651162790698082,0.0004651162790698082,0.0004651162790698082,0.045168812230011235,0.0004651162790698082,0.0004651162790698082,0.0004651162790698082,0.0004651162790698082,0.0004651162790698082,0.06371277474592063,0.0004651162790698082,0.0004651162790698082,0.19884183403850028,0.0004651162790698082,0.0004651162790698082,0.0004651162790698082,0.0004651162790698082,0.0004651162790698082,0.0004651162790698082,0.0004651162790698082,0.0004651162790698082,0.0004651162790698082,0.025138185598420418,0.02828512172670108,0.0004651162790698082,0.0004651162790698082,0.025463855627091657,0.0004651162790698082,0.0004651162790698082,0.0004651162790698082,0.0662849200522245,0.0004651162790698082,0.0004651162790698082,0.0004651162790698082,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

52352,2,"Image nice , it works when it does , hard to Manage This camera had some nice features like the ability to write to a network storage device , smart motion detection , etc . The recorded videos have their own codec so you can use it or d - vix . Some videos are unreadable and if you dig deep enough , d - link has a utility to make them readable . I upgraded the latest firmware 1.06 , tried using the ability to write to a storage device and found it very hard to manage . Motion triggering is touchy but works once you set it up . The wireless caused 90 % of my communication problems . Ran a wire and things were fine . Clock could not keep time for anything . Set USA EDT and it was fine and shortly after it feel back one hour . D - Link knows of this and the only solution was to use Atlantic time . It has all the right features and image is great but I have to vote thumbs down on this unit . One more thing , D - Link hard codes an IP address so if you try and factory reset remotely or of you happen to be using a different network addressing scheme , you 're done .

52424,2,"Bad product from KB Electronics I bought this product from KB Electronics . Because of this product , my digital camera stopped working . On giving a bad review to this product , KB Electronics offered me 10 % discount on my next product . So , I told them that I would give a good review to them if they can repair my camera . At this they went silent . So , basically this means that they would try to make someone silent with a few dollars , but if they have to fix their problems , then they would forget all morals and turn dumb . I do n't know about the current company , but beware of the same thing happening to you guys .

52441,2,"Greatly Disappointing I ca n't say enough positive about Logitech mice . This device , however , was a dismal disappointment . The PC interface works well , and its knowledge of existing components seems impressive . Unfortunately , that in no way translates into a good remote interface . The ability of the unit to reliably turn on multiple components was poor , and , for those with video recorder boxes , very important functionality like the ability to access or schedule recording lists is not readily available ( if its there at all , its hidden many keystrokes deeper than I care to know about ) . Even when reverting to manual operation of individual components , changing which device is being accessed involves two keystrokes ( as opposed to just one on less complex universal remotes -- a much more irritating trait than one might think ) . Overall , for day - to - day functionality I actually consider the barely - programmable remote that came with my Scientific Atlanta DVR vastly superior to the Harmony , which I 've given up on after only a few days of forced use . Considering the ridiculous pricetag , I strongly advise you save yourself a lot of money and your relatives a lot of frustration this year by steering clear of this sad study in user interface failure",231,0,0.0005714285714286104,0.0005714285714286104,0.12048560116888829,0.0005714285714286104,0.0005714285714286104,0.0005714285714286104,0.0005714285714286104,0.0005714285714286104,0.0005714285714286104,0.0005714285714286104,0.0005714285714286104,0.0005714285714286104,0.4048145075856889,0.0005714285714286104,0.0005714285714286104,0.0005714285714286104,0.0005714285714286104,0.0005714285714286104,0.0005714285714286104,0.0005714285714286104,0.0005714285714286104,0.0005714285714286104,0.10101187502750936,0.0005714285714286104,0.0005714285714286104,0.0005714285714286104,0.0005714285714286104,0.0005714285714286104,0.0005714285714286104,0.0005714285714286104,0.0005714285714286104,0.0005714285714286104,0.06477593553663372,0.0005714285714286104,0.0005714285714286104,0.0005714285714286104,0.0005714285714286104,0.0005714285714286104,0.13285435575487733,0.08028429041946764,0.0005714285714286104,0.0005714285714286104,0.0005714285714286104,0.0005714285714286104,0.0005714285714286104,0.0712020059355044,0.0005714285714286104,0.0005714285714286104,0.0005714285714286104,0.0005714285714286104,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

On the shelf it goes for emergencies as I 'll continue to maintain my old keyboard",102,0,0.0008695652173913544,0.053394328105343954,0.0008695652173913544,0.09594132725465411,0.06261115217014655,0.0008695652173913544,0.0008695652173913544,0.0008695652173913544,0.0008695652173913544,0.0008695652173913544,0.0008695652173913544,0.0008695652173913544,0.0008695652173913544,0.0008695652173913544,0.0008695652173913544,0.0008695652173913544,0.0008695652173913544,0.0008695652173913544,0.08782608695652563,0.05557552970719338,0.0008695652173913544,0.0008695652173913544,0.04801182301527406,0.2404808165159468,0.0008695652173913544,0.0008695652173913544,0.0008695652173913544,0.0008695652173913544,0.0008695652173913544,0.0008695652173913544,0.0008695652173913544,0.0008695652173913544,0.04815597310008625,0.0008695652173913544,0.0008695652173913544,0.0008695652173913544,0.0008695652173913544,0.0008695652173913544,0.0008695652173913544,0.0008695652173913544,0.1249108061042252,0.0008695652173913544,0.0008695652173913544,0.0008695652173913544,0.0008695652173913544,0.0008695652173913544,0.14830954837495006,0.0008695652173913544,0.0008695652173913544,0.0008695652173913544,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
52443,2,"Good B / W print / scans , poor software and color scans Used this unit for a few weeks and returned . Annoyances : Sofware : With ADF scanning , you have to enter scan parameters ( paper size etc ) again for every scan and it does not have an option to let you to continue scanning more pages then ADF can hold . You will have to use "" add to file "" function and select all scan parameters again . There is no option to scan double - sided pages as well with using 2 pass scanning . So 3rd party software is definitively needed to get a real value out of ADF scanning . Color Scanning : While B / W scans are fast , color scanning speed is very poor to me . Scanning stack of color pages could take ages . Slow color scanning speed was observed in both USB and network modes . FAX : Number of rings before FAX answers is limited to 4 and I found no way to increase that .

Only complaint is the cumbersome battery case and cheap feeling plastic construction . However , none of this mattered when it just stopped working 4 months after purchase .

So shop around , but forget about the Koss",118,0,0.0010000000000000562,0.0010000000000000562,0.0010000000000000562,0.0010000000000000562,0.0010000000000000562,0.0010000000000000562,0.0010000000000000562,0.0010000000000000562,0.0010000000000000562,0.0010000000000000562,0.0010000000000000562,0.0010000000000000562,0.0010000000000000562,0.0010000000000000562,0.0010000000000000562,0.0010000000000000562,0.0010000000000000562,0.30095725378874133,0.051000000000001044,0.0010000000000000562,0.0010000000000000562,0.0010000000000000562,0.0010000000000000562,0.12097185720668328,0.0010000000000000562,0.06750232412379255,0.0010000000000000562,0.0010000000000000562,0.2035655027303303,0.0010000000000000562,0.0010000000000000562,0.0010000000000000562,0.11014488564443839,0.0010000000000000562,0.0010000000000000562,0.0010000000000000562,0.0010000000000000562,0.0010000000000000562,0.0010000000000000562,0.0010000000000000562,0.0010000000000000562,0.0010000000000000562,0.0010000000000000562,0.0010000000000000562,0.10285817650601095,0.0010000000000000562,0.0010000000000000562,0.0010000000000000562,0.0010000000000000562,0.0010000000000000562,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1

52487,2,"Cheap and Buggy The features , size , and design of this unit are what drew me in . But after just a few uses , I quickly came to realize that this was nothing more than cheap electronics wrapped up in an attractive , but completely unusable package . To start with , the unit is small - the smallest of its kind . But the bulky external mic makes the overall footprint just as large as some of the palmtop units that this was made to replace . Second , the unit has a built - in rechargeable battery that can not be removed . So , when it crashes , which it does frequently , there is no way to "" cold - boot "" the unit by removing the battery . This is also a problem because it reduces the unit 's true portability because you can easily get stuck with no remaining battery life and no AC power to recharge it . Then , what you have is a paperweight . Oh , and by the way , when you do have it plugged in to charge , the backlight is always on ( even if the power is off ) . So forget about using this unit as a plugged in desktop recorder either . But , all of this aside , the firmware simply does not work . It locks up incessantly and , with no way to reboot , you literally have to unplug it , wait for it to auto - power - off , and hope that you can start the machine up again . And , to add insult to injury , the body is a cheap Chinese - made piece of plastic with absolutely no meat on its bones . Overall , do n't be taken in by the low price .

First , I tried to upgrade the drivers . My current version was 1.0.5.0 . I downloaded the version 1.12 from D - Link 's site . After uninstalling and reinstalling ( several times ) I still had 1.0.5.0 . An hour and a half on the phone with D - Link tech support and I still had 1.0.5.0 . Another hour on Google , and I 'm not the only one with this issue . Seems to be a version - control issue with D - Link . Then , even more irritating , every time after I use my wired connection and go back to wireless I have to reinstall the drivers and reboot . And re - enter all my security info again .

52513,2,NOT SO GREAT AS THEY SAY.JUST OK These radios look nice but there are some problems here . First the batteries do not last long unless you do not talk . Second the biggest problem for me was uncompatibility with other radios and brands . The receive quality is very poor and hard to understand at times . I also hace a T7200 and the difference is like night and day . The 7200 is the best . The 7400 i believe is an has flaws and that is why you see them priced so low .

52516,2,"Cheap as in Quality not Price I commute via public transportation , the majority of that on a noisy train . Earbuds and over ear headphones do n't block out enough of the noise to enjoy the music . I received these Philips HN110 headphones as a gift . When I first got these I was pretty disappointed at how flimsy they appeared . I have some KOSS over ear head phones which are nice and beefy . These are scrawny but on the other hand take up less space . They use a single AAA batt . Using them on the train I was able to turn down the volume on my music player a tad but a lot of the noise still gets through . I 'm not an expert on these but I guess this noise cancelling works mainly on lower frequencies . Alot of the noise on the train is higher in pitch and thus gets through . The next thing I noticed was that with a cord coming out of both the left and right earphone you are limited in how you can put these on and take them off . My KOSS and Sony headphones and earbuds use the single cord to one phone and the connecting cord from there ( or it runs through the headphone band ) . I realize I like this single cord feature very much . Again these Philips HN 110 do n't have this . I also noticed that when the Noise Cancelling is turned on and the wind is blowing you can hear the wind as if it were amplified . After about a month and a half the battery compartment door latch broke inside . Now I ca n't open the battery compartment without doing some damage to these headphones . I checked Philips website for info on these phones but I could n't find any . I called their customer support and they told me I had to call a different # . I called the different number and got the Return Merchandise Authorization # but was told I need to send the receipt in . I got them as a gift so I do n't have the receipt . In summary , their noise cancelling ability is pretty week . Better than my hefty non - noise cancelling KOSS over ears or my stethascope like Sony ear buds but only by about 10 % or so ( just to put a number in their ) . Flimsy design . Cords from both earphones . Hear the wind amplified . Battery compartment latch broke after a month and a half and their warrenty sucks",449,0,0.0002702702702703006,0.05373875612383486,0.015366546787947548,0.05173101076412193,0.048068307289861056,0.0002702702702703006,0.0002702702702703006,0.0002702702702703006,0.014346859496436238,0.0002702702702703006,0.0002702702702703006,0.0272972972972967,0.0002702702702703006,0.0002702702702703006,0.04081081081081417,0.0002702702702703006,0.20691713532234687,0.0002702702702703006,0.0002702702702703006,0.0002702702702703006,0.0002702702702703006,0.02261451800633091,0.1153105969406718,0.0002702702702703006,0.0002702702702703006,0.0002702702702703006,0.1321581083317707,0.0002702702702703006,0.10929652857382864,0.0002702702702703006,0.0002702702702703006,0.0002702702702703006,0.0002702702702703006,0.0002702702702703006,0.0002702702702703006,0.0002702702702703006,0.0002702702702703006,0.0002702702702703006,0.0002702702702703006,0.04458112991697226,0.0002702702702703006,0.0002702702702703006,0.0002702702702703006,0.0002702702702703006,0.0002702702702703006,0.08077515146421857,0.02752778341408736,0.0002702702702703006,0.0002702702702703006,0.0002702702702703006,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0
52524,2,"Great product , terrible cost . Have you ever heard the saying that something would cost you "" an arm and a leg "" ? These cables cost that , your first son , and bidding rights to your estate . Do n't get me wrong- Monster makes great cables . Let there be no confusion on this point . But they 're just incredibly expensive , and this is made much worse with these cables . Several people have pointed out that the digital signal on HDMI cables must adhere to error - correction and certain standards ( even a $ 10 cable cable must meet some specifications to even reach production)- and this is largely true . Unless BluRay implements new features that require new cables at some point in the future , there 's really very little difference between HDMI cables . Yes , the gold - plated pins and other features will improve your connection a bit , but the improvement will be far less than you 'd see between any other "" cheap "" versus "" designer "" cables on the market . But Monster cables really are made to a standard that makes some difference , and that 's worth mentioning . This cable is built sturdy , so that none but the most harsh of treatment could ever damage it . And the shielding is n't just the usual electrical shielding- Monster cables are toughened to the point that I would n't doubt if they 're certified against nuclear fallout . If you have the money to blow and you want the confidence of knowing that your entertainment center could fare well in an EMP strike , you 're looking at the right cables . But for nearly all consumers , these cables cost 4x as much as alternatives , with no real plusses . At the very least , you can pick up a mid - grade cable ( Sony , etc ) at a mid - grade price ( $ 40 ) to get the increased sturdiness and the gold - plated connections . And over these products , the Monster cables basically have nothing at all except their branding . Please do look up a cheaper alternative this time , and spend some of the extra money on an extra set of whatever tools you use to keep your screen clean . You 'll get much better results with these tools than you will worrying about $ 100 HDMI cables",420,0,0.24307356549215997,0.1007181356674117,0.0003636363636363925,0.02027700875687093,0.046757195060641285,0.0003636363636363925,0.0003636363636363925,0.0003636363636363925,0.03901591933624781,0.0003636363636363925,0.039180643847421336,0.0003636363636363925,0.0003636363636363925,0.0003636363636363925,0.0003636363636363925,0.0003636363636363925,0.0003636363636363925,0.15495341674653595,0.0003636363636363925,0.0003636363636363925,0.0003636363636363925,0.0003636363636363925,0.0003636363636363925,0.0003636363636363925,0.0003636363636363925,0.0003636363636363925,0.0003636363636363925,0.0003636363636363925,0.0003636363636363925,0.0003636363636363925,0.0003636363636363925,0.0003636363636363925,0.051407381387864604,0.0003636363636363925,0.0003636363636363925,0.0003636363636363925,0.0003636363636363925,0.0003636363636363925,0.0003636363636363925,0.1910981173925278,0.0003636363636363925,0.01854545454545293,0.0003636363636363925,0.0003636363636363925,0.08079134358504635,0.0003636363636363925,0.0003636363636363925,0.0003636363636363925,0.0003636363636363925,0.0003636363636363925,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

52554,2,Problems at radom This LEXAR brand has had issues with it 's Memory Cards . I lost lots of pictures from a vacation to Disney World and a Convention . Their site had SOFTWARE that was to help recover some of those lost images ! ! I have never had Flash memory trouble until LEXAR ! I now only buy SCANDISK items . Samsung invented this tecnology and SD is their product . The Store I bought the LEXAR chip was in a hurry to give me another chip I could trust . He gave me the higher costing SD chip . I was n't the first to have issues from buying it in his store . He took a $ 50.00 loss to make me happy . People take lots of photos now that we went Digital . Imagine looking for some pictures you know you took and they are not there ! Most think they messed up . WIth this chip you will have that happen so pay very close attention . Most of what is lost can not be recovered . Pay the extra money for SCANDISK .,191,0,0.18564291577833777,0.0006250000000000547,0.0006250000000000547,0.0006250000000000547,0.0006250000000000547,0.06570635193059673,0.0006250000000000547,0.0006250000000000547,0.0006250000000000547,0.0006250000000000547,0.02685181902011388,0.0006250000000000547,0.0006250000000000547,0.0006250000000000547,0.03187500000000062,0.0006250000000000547,0.0006250000000000547,0.31397425043182553,0.0006250000000000547,0.0006250000000000547,0.0006250000000000547,0.0006250000000000547,0.11533251637333784,0.0006250000000000547,0.031892772483694924,0.0006250000000000547,0.0006250000000000547,0.0006250000000000547,0.03187499999999783,0.0006250000000000547,0.0006250000000000547,0.0006250000000000547,0.0006250000000000547,0.0006250000000000547,0.0006250000000000547,0.0006250000000000547,0.0006250000000000547,0.0006250000000000547,0.0006250000000000547,0.05687267665104683,0.114976697331046,0.0006250000000000547,0.0006250000000000547,0.0006250000000000547,0.0006250000000000547,0.0006250000000000547,0.0006250000000000547,0.0006250000000000547,0.0006250000000000547,0.0006250000000000547,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

If you want to buy this , I suggest you tie the wire and the remote using a rubber band around your IPOD to support it 's weight without pulling the wire off the connector",134,0,0.0008695652173913595,0.0008695652173913595,0.0008695652173913595,0.0008695652173913595,0.0008695652173913595,0.0008695652173913595,0.0008695652173913595,0.0008695652173913595,0.04864592217690363,0.0008695652173913595,0.06455897713644403,0.0008695652173913595,0.0008695652173913595,0.0008695652173913595,0.0008695652173913595,0.0008695652173913595,0.0008695652173913595,0.12824031680340633,0.0008695652173913595,0.0008695652173913595,0.0008695652173913595,0.0008695652173913595,0.08083210339530426,0.0008695652173913595,0.0008695652173913595,0.0008695652173913595,0.0008695652173913595,0.0008695652173913595,0.08965650266277043,0.0008695652173913595,0.0008695652173913595,0.0008695652173913595,0.0008695652173913595,0.0008695652173913595,0.0008695652173913595,0.0008695652173913595,0.0008695652173913595,0.0008695652173913595,0.0008695652173913595,0.11004513559983117,0.0008695652173913595,0.0008695652173913595,0.0008695652173913595,0.0008695652173913595,0.36060865908918976,0.0008695652173913595,0.0808906440057132,0.0008695652173913595,0.0008695652173913595,0.0008695652173913595,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0

If one wants to keep the insert regardless of whether or not the "" cut offs "" are present it would be best if the paper was inserted within the opposite position in the paper tray in the printer so one can cut to the size needed .

52610,2,"Does not work , bad service The DVD burner connected very easily through USB , was immediately recognized by WinXP , the software installation was fine . I was beginning to feel good . However , whenever I burned a DVD ( I tried 4 different brands , some R , some RW etc ... ) , several files would contain errors , and would be completely unreadable . The burning process moreover does not detect this : one needs to verify the data written to check and find these errors . Moreover , the firmware update just does not work on my machine , pardon , machineS. Completely standard Dell machines , all latest WinXP and drivers , good CPUs ( 3Ghz and up ) , lots of memory , big hard - drives . I called customer service to try to solve the problem . First of all the average waiting time to get to a technician was about 30 minutes . The rudeness and the plain lies these guys give you are amazing . To make a long story short , I had to call 3 times . First guy : oh , "" of course it does n't work , you have EasyCD creator installed ! "" . Ok , I buy it , I go through the ( painful ) uninstallation process of Roxio 's software . No problems solved . Second guy : "" Oh , of course it does not work , it requires 10Gb of free hard - drive space ! It 's written on the box "" . Plain lie : on the box it says you need 10Gb for NeroVision ( for burning videos ) , but only 1Gb for Nero . Quarrel ( they are tough ! ) with the guy who could not care less about the fact I got him lying , or that the product description is wrong . Ok , patiently I freed up 10Gb from hard drive , try again , exactly same problem . The only thing they could offer in the end was a replacement . I got perhaps relative lucky because the replacement will be a 720 , not a 710 , since 710 is not manufactured anymore ( wonder why ? ) . Notice I tried this on two different machines ( one laptop and one desktop ) , with identical results . Other lie : I noticed , as somebody else here , that the Nero software provided writes only on Sony drives : so if Nero is really the only software that should be installed because of conflicts with Roxio ( et al . ? ) , you will never be able to use your own CD drive to burn CDs . How ridicolous is that ? ? ? ? The technician said this is because I had both software(s ) installed , but that was another lie . The incompetence of these guys is beyond belief . If the new drive will not work , I hopefully will get a refund through my credit card . You know , the technician even said that that is not possible , credit cards companies do not do that ( LOL )",542,0,0.00020202020202022216,0.00020202020202022216,0.00020202020202022216,0.00020202020202022216,0.025954548500888828,0.025014730648019953,0.015228109542312103,0.00020202020202022216,0.00020202020202022216,0.00020202020202022216,0.00020202020202022216,0.00020202020202022216,0.2086808449110536,0.00020202020202022216,0.010303030303028692,0.00020202020202022216,0.13875047057227718,0.03881666447749284,0.020395980270953483,0.00020202020202022216,0.00020202020202022216,0.00020202020202022216,0.1145682490374398,0.00020202020202022216,0.011227634040144865,0.00020202020202022216,0.06403662015463822,0.00020202020202022216,0.00020202020202022216,0.00020202020202022216,0.00020202020202022216,0.00020202020202022216,0.00020202020202022216,0.00020202020202022216,0.00020202020202022216,0.00020202020202022216,0.032319318449655715,0.00020202020202022216,0.1034115006527926,0.00020202020202022216,0.00020202020202022216,0.04060608463584591,0.00020202020202022216,0.00020202020202022216,0.07753979759336012,0.00020202020202022216,0.06627772934140864,0.00020202020202022216,0.00020202020202022216,0.00020202020202022216,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0

52613,2,"Not Compatible with Windows 2000 / XP , HORRIBLE Tech Support - AVOID ! ! I had this adapter running in my the Cardbus slot of my Windows 98 computer and it ran fine . I installed it on my Windows 2000 laptop . Well , my first sign of trouble was a warning popup when I installed the drivers that the drivers were not certified by Microsoft . So , imagine my shock when my brand new computer constantly got Blue Screen of Death ( BSOD ) crashes . Big blue screen , loss of data , computer freezes tight , power button inoperative , and when you have to use a pin to press that tiny little laptop reset button on a brand new computer , well , we all know that 's when you 're in Computer Hell . I'm a Microsoft Certified Professional so I was able to narrow down the source of the problem . After definitely identifying the FA511 as the culprit , I contacted Netgear 's online tech support . And that 's when things really started to get ugly . It took forever for Netgear to finally give me an answer . This was after days of inactivity , wildly inappropriate responses , and repeatedly requesting same information from me . Finally , Netgear escalated the problem to their next level of tech support and I was shocked to read their solution : "" This is a Windows issue regarding permissions and * * * 16 BIT * * * compatibility mode "" While they were vague as to the exact nature of the problem , and contradicted themselves as to whether compatibility mode had to be enabled or disabled , their solution was straightforward : I was directed to a Microsoft Knowledge Base article which tells you how to enable Compatibility Mode - and for 16-bit compatibility mode I had to make my nice clean Windows 2000 computer compatible with Windows 95 ( yes , ninety - five).So , while the FA511 hardware is a 32-bit Cardbus adapter , apparently their drivers are 16-bit ! ! ! No wonder the FA511 was never certified for Windows 2000 . And I would n't trust it for Windows XP either . There are other Ethernet adapters out there by 3COM , Belkin , Linksys , SMC , and Xircom that work flawlessly with Windows 2000 / XP by companies that will respond to your questions . Go get them .

The second unit lasted for 4 days until I fell waist deep into a stream with the unit in my pocket .

Garmin 's claim of waterproofness for 1 m for 10 minutes is utter baloney . The poorly designed T - style lock on the battery case can not possibly assure water integrity from anything beyond high humidity . I probably would n't buy buy another Garmin but I 'm stuck with them as I have already invested $ 200 in proprietary MapSource software . I guess that was their plan .

52685,2,Do not buy this radio ! The GE Superadio III used to be a great radio . I bought my first one seven years ago and it worked so well that I bought another . I have recently purchased two more as gifts and they are not the same radio . Side - by - side they look the same ( except for the numbers on the tuning dial ) . Inside they have dissimilar circuit boards . The real difference is the two new radios are unable to tune stations nearly as well as the older radios .

52693,2,"Good player but very poor construction My player had the same headphones jack problem that so many people here have had , which ended up rendering it useless ( out of warranty ) . However , while it worked , I was quite pleased with the player and the included software . Everything was intutive and ran smoothly ( except for an occational freeze with the player which never became frequent enough to be a major burden ) . I also liked the fact that this player was n't bound by iTunes or file format restrictions . My only other complaint was that occasionally the touchpad made moving small increments like up one track or down one track somewhat difficult ( just give me buttons , I know they are n't sexy but they 're easy and work well ) . I am giving the product 2 stars because , while I liked it , Creative has known about the headphones flaw for a long time and has not improved the build ( being that this is STILL a problem with these players ) .

52696,2,"Whoa ! ! ! Apples and Oranges Several reviews mention the improvement when these cables to replace a composite ( L / R audio + video ) cable , or an S - video ( multi - pinned plug ) . ALmost all of that improvement is due to the fact that these cable connection methods are completely different types in signal format and the TV uses different internal circuitry for each one . Virtually any S - video cable connection will give a better image than a composite type cable , and any component ( individual R - G - B video ) connection will be better than S - video . Cable brand has absolutely nothing to do with it .

52711,2,"Bad sounding headphones ! I 've been a fan of Sony earbuds for many years . Due to the bad reviews of durability of the latest Sony earbuds , I decided on purchasing these Panasonic headphones . I bought these headphones because my Sony headphones died after 3 years and to upgrade my factory Creative Zen Micro headphones . I found a perfect fit between the 3 size earplugs . I 've noticed that it does block out the sound in your surroundings . It 's good for that commute to work when there is a lot of noise . I like the around the neck feature . As far as quality , the extention part of the wiring looks durable but not the around the neck part of it . As far as the performance of the headphones , I 'm really disappointed in these headphones . My factory Creative headphones had out performed these . The bass level is too low even when I max out the bass in the player . The mids and treble sound like crap . Do n't waste your money on these !

52778,2,"JUNK , JUNK , JUNK ! I just purchased yesterday the Home Dock Deluxe for list price at a local retailer . I read all the reviews , ( most of them bad but I got it anyway ) the menu on TV part being my motivation . And so far , I am not feeling good about buying it ... 1 . The sound quality is very poor . Almost every song has some distortion and sounds "" muffled "" along with a good hiss . I thought I was listening to a 70 's era cassette it was so bad ! I have a high end Sony / Infinity system and the poor sound is very noticeable . In desperation ( and checking to make sure my amp was working fine ) I plugged in my Apple dock from my 4th Gen Photo 60 gb and the standard Apple AV cable . The sound problem disappeared , and was crystal clear.2 . The menus to not work properly . My Nano 5 gb seems to work OK , but my 60 gb 4th Gen Photo does not . The menus are rather slow , and the artist , or album , or song titles disappear at random . Sometimes you can back up a level on the menu and you will see the data , but mostly it is just blank . The cursor will scroll down as though there is data there , but nothing shows on the screen . You can play the music from the blank screen , but it is pot luck as to what you will play as you can not see any titles . I like the idea , but VERY , VERY frustrating.3 . There is NO support at all from the DLO website . It just lets me download a PDF of the manual or to buy more accessories . I did not even bother contacting them due to all the problems . I am not impressed . 4 . There also all the other problems listed elsewhere , too light and build quality poor , annoying power LED on front , no artwork on TV menu etc ... 5 . So basically , it is WAY too expensive . Not worth it . Not even worth 10 % of the price charged . I should have listened to all the comments above , and not believed some of the "" official "" reviews on the web . So it is back in the box and ready for a trip back to the store . I guess my lesson is that I should trust the reviews",446,0,0.10623267286737571,0.0002941176470588467,0.10289866648545515,0.017308854126250012,0.0002941176470588467,0.0002941176470588467,0.0002941176470588467,0.0002941176470588467,0.07675175539514821,0.0002941176470588467,0.0002941176470588467,0.0002941176470588467,0.0002941176470588467,0.0002941176470588467,0.022940741615604308,0.0002941176470588467,0.06373380229997667,0.26356139045108884,0.0002941176470588467,0.0002941176470588467,0.0002941176470588467,0.0002941176470588467,0.053091277566580726,0.0002941176470588467,0.0002941176470588467,0.0002941176470588467,0.0002941176470588467,0.0002941176470588467,0.06282419516137766,0.0002941176470588467,0.0002941176470588467,0.0002941176470588467,0.03332514076815832,0.0002941176470588467,0.0002941176470588467,0.0002941176470588467,0.0002941176470588467,0.0002941176470588467,0.12138526318443257,0.0002941176470588467,0.0002941176470588467,0.0150000028290603,0.0500638843083143,0.0002941176470588467,0.0002941176470588467,0.0002941176470588467,0.0002941176470588467,0.0002941176470588467,0.0002941176470588467,0.0002941176470588467,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

52812,2,"Need a bit more longevity I originally purchased the unit during the winter because of a sale , but I did n't install it until the beginning of July for our cross country trip from Oregon to Wash. DC . During the trip , there was quite a bit of interuption from hillsides and tall trees in the Pacific Northwest . I kind of wondered how well the reception would work in the city . Once I got out of the NW , I had no problems picking up a signal unless I was in a long tunnel or deep valley . I did notice the unit did get hot during the trip and I think that is why it is acting the way it is now ( two months later ) . It works fine when first turned on , but after 15 minutes , the signal flutuates and at times , no signal is received . The tech support said that I needed to check the wires , but since it is ' recently ' installed and it does n't happen when first turned on , I 'm ruling it a receiver problem . The unit is placed just below the radio head and has been exposed to direct sunlight when parked . I 'm sure it did n't help . I'm currently looking for a better unit and XM said they would transfer the remainder of the account to the new radio without inducing an activation charge .",251,0,0.07428402821968104,0.07882476569282766,0.00041666666666669814,0.00041666666666669814,0.00041666666666669814,0.00041666666666669814,0.00041666666666669814,0.00041666666666669814,0.00041666666666669814,0.00041666666666669814,0.00041666666666669814,0.021249999999998118,0.2803496270395772,0.00041666666666669814,0.00041666666666669814,0.00041666666666669814,0.00041666666666669814,0.00041666666666669814,0.021249430557536475,0.00041666666666669814,0.00041666666666669814,0.10493028379299751,0.19227969784846705,0.00041666666666669814,0.00041666666666669814,0.00041666666666669814,0.031617466473252816,0.00041666666666669814,0.00041666666666669814,0.00041666666666669814,0.00041666666666669814,0.00041666666666669814,0.00041666666666669814,0.00041666666666669814,0.00041666666666669814,0.00041666666666669814,0.00041666666666669814,0.00041666666666669814,0.09377507040704068,0.00041666666666669814,0.00041666666666669814,0.00041666666666669814,0.0847729633019534,0.00041666666666669814,0.00041666666666669814,0.00041666666666669814,0.00041666666666669814,0.00041666666666669814,0.00041666666666669814,0.00041666666666669814,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

52824,2,"unimpressed Ok ... it functions well as a clock radio . Just fine . Reliable . But that 's not too much to expect . Yes , it will charge your iPod and it does have the nifty function of an alarm that gradually ( though not gradual enough ) gets louder . The adaptor for my Nano fit fine ; and I did n't find the clock too bright ( it has 3 settings ) . But the sound is really terrible . It sounds like its coming from a transistor radio . As well , it advertises that you will be able to go to sleep and wake up with your iPod . But as we know , you do n't need a clock radio to do that -- your iPod will do that on its own if you set it . I took this back after 5 days and hooked up some cheap computer speakers with a volume control .

52841,2,"Love the features , Hate the range and usage ! From cellphone and also the pager era I began my love affair with Motorola . Do n't need to read much farther into my review to get to the meat of it . Sometimes companies make a lousy product even though they have others that are great ! Do n't Buy These ! They fall into the former category I needed them quickly ( to give my in - laws time to practice using them before we went on a cruise ) so when I went to their house for the weekend I bought them from the hated "" Best Buy "" . I am returning all 4 ! ( 2 sets of 2 handsets ) . Here was my experience : I went in and saw the Midland and the Cobra along side the Motorola . Not knowing much of Midland , but recognizing Cobra from their history with low - end phones and electronics , I opted with the very stylish Motorola T6500R 's . I know . Big Mistake ! I am a computer programmer and very intelligent , but when confronted with products I do not undestand , I go for the brand name . Which is something that can be forgiven if , as now , you find out what the problem is and correct it . I took them home and recharged them . First things first : The feel in your hand . EXCELLENT . They feel as good as they look . I purchased these to go on a cruise to the Mexican Riviera and to maintain contact both on the boat and in the ports : Puerto Vallarta , Mazatlan and Cabo san Lucas . We wanted to make sure we did not "" lose "" my in - laws ( really ! I mean it ! No , really .... ) Anyway . Charged them up and turned them on . They come with a plastic - encased group of 3 AA rechargable batteries that fit nicely ( and only one way -- they are keyed ) in the dual - purpose battery compartment . This is nice : if you are out and running around and your charge goes down , simply buy 3 AA alkaline batteries and go on your way . There is no problem if you forget you have the NORMAL NON - RECHARGABLE AA batteries in the case if you put it in the charging stand . Unlike other units , the physical metal conductors to charge the battery pack are actually built into the pack , not the handset . If you put it batteries , the charger makes no connection to the handset . If you put in the rechargable battery pack , 2 silver contacts from the battery pack contact the charging stand and VOILA the unit charges . Fitting the handset into the recharger is a nightmare , though ! It must be generic and able to fit several different Motorola products ( production outsourced to Giant Int'l Ltd -- so if you thought this was a genuine Motorola built item , you are mistaken . The entire Talkabout line are outsourced for production ) as the dual - compartment charger has 2 inserts in each compartment and no indication of which one to use for the T6500R 's . I am a smart person though so I chose the one that looked like it best fit and inserted it . Then I attempted to insert the T6500R 's . I say attempted because the bottom of the handset is rounded and thus does not seat well in any direction . After you get it to EXACTLY the right position ( look on the charger to watch for the LED to light up ) the the hard part ( of charging , that is ) is over . Next item : Bad red LCD backed screen . Hard to read in ANY light and impossible in the sunlight . Settings were easy enough . Channel , sub - channel , vibrate , NOAA broadcasts , etc . However , the advertised QT ( ensures no one can talk through your handset unless they are using a compatible Motorola handset ) does not work unless you hit the PTT ( push to talk ) button ( or the CALL button ) , wait about 3 seconds and begin speaking . My in - laws are new to technology and are used to experiencing walkie - talkies when their kids were young . Therefore this is unusual . They automatically want to push the button and talk . So , the first part of what they say is immediately lost . I say "" first part "" . I am assuming I actually caught a portion of what they said . This brings me to the second major flaw . This unit contains a HORRIBLE speaker . If the volume is too low then you ca n't hear it . Too high and it is garbled beyond your ability to understand it . We were really hard - pressed to find a happy medium . AND , in a noisy room , it would 've been impossible to hear anything . Some merchants list these as 5 mile radios . The packaging says 10 . The 1 watt GMRS suggests about 5 - 10 . We got less than 1 . Directly over a lake . In vehicles on the I-5 , we drove less than 2 miles from their house ( which is DIRECTLY ON the interstate ) and got no signal . I got back to my house in San Jose ( on top of Communications Hill ... the largest "" hill "" in the area ) and could not communicate to my spouse less than 1/2 mile away while he was coming up our road!Since the weekend , I have spent all my extra time on Amazon.com and Consumer Reports reviewing all the offerings . ( the latter , Consumer Reports ' reviews are from July in 2002 ! ) So , I think I am going to return these and purchase the Midland 5 watt GXT500 's from Amazon . Remember , doubling the wattage ( in this case MORE than doubling ) does not give double the signal . As another others have stated , increasing wattage increases only another portion of the distance -- ie : 2 watts to 4 watts does NOT double the distance the signal can reach.)Hope this reveiw helps you",1107,0,0.00012738853503186268,0.07520354472918915,0.009177079065410255,0.050946500800656165,0.00012738853503186268,0.01318384184834613,0.007315503256366721,0.00012738853503186268,0.0379132873896548,0.00012738853503186268,0.00012738853503186268,0.00012738853503186268,0.18325103280936908,0.00012738853503186268,0.006496815286622166,0.00012738853503186268,0.04199258230880417,0.08102708829950878,0.012866242038216923,0.034160999045485516,0.00012738853503186268,0.00012738853503186268,0.10186810508151639,0.023152258355003785,0.014581363148295057,0.020362620595506507,0.01922998815139761,0.00012738853503186268,0.006837124296231788,0.00012738853503186268,0.00012738853503186268,0.007531609361211133,0.10303865721132785,0.00012738853503186268,0.00012738853503186268,0.00012738853503186268,0.00012738853503186268,0.00012738853503186268,0.03258599496739792,0.01909372949133762,0.00012738853503186268,0.00012738853503186268,0.00012738853503186268,0.00012738853503186268,0.07150236388429124,0.023369566668024817,0.00012738853503186268,0.00012738853503186268,0.00012738853503186268,0.00012738853503186268,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0

When this was pulled from the box the finish was splotchy . It looks like someone painted the keys in a garage . I expected better . Now I have used it for a couple of weeks in an office environment , and already one of the plastic keyboard legs has broken . I am not hard on the equipment and do n't know how it happened . Once in a while I press keys and nothing happens . I can live with that . On the other hand , the mouse works as expected . Before you purchase one , check the process for returning it !

52917,2,"Good TV but .. I have had this TV for less than 90 days and bulb has burned out , I called Samsung support and the bulb is covered by warranty . They said they would send my phone number to service center and they would contact me in no more than 72 hours . 72 hours later still no call , I again called Samsung and they said they would contact the service center again and I would be called in 24 hours , still no call . This was repeated 5 times and each time I asked to be referred to another center but was told none existed in my area . Fianlly after 6 calls , Samsung referred me to another center . I then called them and they sent up an appointment 3 days later . Day of appointment technician called and told me from the problem I described when I made the appointment I needed a new bulb ( duh ) and he had ordered one this morning and would call to make another appointment once they received the bulb . I specifically asked if they had the bulb in stock when I made the appointment . Why they did n't order the bulb when they first set up the appointment , I do n't know . I called Samsung again and was told bulbs are usually shipped within a week of the order . Neither the words usually or week improved my impression of their support . My fear is that when the technician comes out to change the bulb he will find another part he has to order and I am back on the Samsung support merry - go - round again . Now I realize that even though the set does ( did ) have a good picture etc , if you ca n't see it , it does n't matter . I now have a very expensive paperweight . For me Samsung support has been a black hole and I have yet to see any results after two weeks and no hope in sight for the near future . What happens after the warranty is over and I have to pay for a new bulb every three months ? If this sounds like I am not very happy with the situation that is the truth . I am tired of Samsung and the service centers being sorry for the problems and delays but then telling me there is nothing they can do at this point . I agree , you solve the problem by doing the right thing the first time or the second time or third time etc I am hoping maybe the eighth time is the charm with my Samsung experience .",463,0,0.00024390243902441152,0.00024390243902441152,0.0575533804198597,0.0919754924335261,0.00024390243902441152,0.04841661098920257,0.00024390243902441152,0.00024390243902441152,0.00024390243902441152,0.00024390243902441152,0.00024390243902441152,0.012439024390241483,0.23257535766983953,0.00024390243902441152,0.00024390243902441152,0.00024390243902441152,0.00024390243902441152,0.00024390243902441152,0.00024390243902441152,0.00024390243902441152,0.00024390243902441152,0.00024390243902441152,0.0919767391331662,0.04504716661550073,0.01432333405489669,0.03929019351137983,0.12736072266663445,0.00024390243902441152,0.00024390243902441152,0.013184659581171487,0.00024390243902441152,0.00024390243902441152,0.00024390243902441152,0.00024390243902441152,0.00024390243902441152,0.015061654590168897,0.00024390243902441152,0.00024390243902441152,0.00024390243902441152,0.00024390243902441152,0.00024390243902441152,0.00024390243902441152,0.018080093077595744,0.00024390243902441152,0.00024390243902441152,0.18393508306193795,0.00024390243902441152,0.00024390243902441152,0.00024390243902441152,0.00024390243902441152,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

The big problem for me was the time it took to change channels . A full 3 seconds . Went back to the store and found this is a common problem with tube tvs . Well I took it back and went to Walmart and got a Sanyo HT27546 for $ 270 . Good set with quick channel change . It also has an optical digital outputwhich the Toshiba did not . The Sanyo also has a full one year warrenty . Sound on both TVs is fine . A small point .

52935,2,"Not suitable for use in a moving vehicle It 's partly my fault , of course . I bought this to use on my motorcycle . I thought the small size , especially the flat body , would fit nicely into the top of a tank bag . I also bought a special handlebar mount for it . Unfortunately , I 've had nothing but trouble with it . It 's slow to acquire satellites and to recalculate routes . Whether you 're driving a car or a motorcycle , it 's not up to the task of keeping pace with changes in your route . Maybe it was intended for pedestrians only . The user interface for the GPS is not intuitive ( at least , not for me ) , Worse still , it freezes often when trying to download maps and when deleting stored routes . The Garmin helpline in the UK could only tell me to reset the machine each time . Not very helpful . My guess is that the combination of palm PC and GPS was too much for Garmin to handle . They should probably just stick to GPS .",197,0,0.04384382433822323,0.09869141922333412,0.0007142857142858174,0.0007142857142858174,0.03953016175436164,0.0007142857142858174,0.04738276934828095,0.0007142857142858174,0.0007142857142858174,0.0007142857142858174,0.0007142857142858174,0.0007142857142858174,0.320762678328611,0.0007142857142858174,0.0007142857142858174,0.0007142857142858174,0.046118565306621416,0.09489039656029072,0.0007142857142858174,0.041527438111405655,0.0007142857142858174,0.0007142857142858174,0.0007142857142858174,0.03615060525207559,0.06623307039602651,0.0007142857142858174,0.0007142857142858174,0.0007142857142858174,0.0007142857142858174,0.0007142857142858174,0.0007142857142858174,0.0007142857142858174,0.0007142857142858174,0.0007142857142858174,0.0007142857142858174,0.0007142857142858174,0.0007142857142858174,0.0007142857142858174,0.0007142857142858174,0.0007142857142858174,0.0007142857142858174,0.0007142857142858174,0.0007142857142858174,0.0007142857142858174,0.06414159428112849,0.0007142857142858174,0.07358461995677976,0.0007142857142858174,0.0007142857142858174,0.0007142857142858174,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0

52946,2,"disappointing I bought this phone for a work - at - home situation . I then discovered that the maximum number of characters I could enter into a speed dial entry ( the number itself , not the name ) is 24 characters . A telephone calling card number is 25 characters long , 26 if you program a pause ( a space , for this phone ) between the phone number and the card id / pin . When I called Polycom about it , I was told that not everyone uses calling cards . Funny . I 've been issued a calling card at every company for which I 've worked ( going back 25 years ) . This is the only phone I 've ever owned ( well , since the 80 's ) into which I could not program my calling cards . Pretty basic stuff for product marketing and development people to miss . On top of that , when I try and enter the calling card number and card i d by hand , it never "" takes "" on the first try : the network does n't recognize the card i d and pin the first time I enter them . I have to do it twice ( I 've tried this a number of times , and it 's consistent).For that matter , the sound quality , especially through the headset ( also purchased from polycom ) is not that good .

52963,2,"fatal design flaw I bought this because it seemed like it would satisfy my need for a 2-line phone with answering capability . Turns out , I can not keep it , due to one boneheaded design flaw that makes it unusable for me . The good : it 's nice looking , compact , has good sound , and has a selection of cute little ringtones . The bad : This machine WILL NOT RECORD INCOMING MESSAGES SILENTLY . It broadcasts both the OGM and the ICM being left by the caller through the speaker . There is no way I know of to defeat this . You can turn the volume down from loud to medium loud , but you can not set the machine to record messages silently , in the background . Do you think you might ever not want other people in the room to hear the messages being left on your recorder ? Would you ever want to sleep without being disturbed by the sound of incoming messages?Then this one is n't for you .

I will be buying another phone that is not a Uniden",106,0,0.001538461538461641,0.001538461538461641,0.001538461538461641,0.001538461538461641,0.139059089155047,0.001538461538461641,0.001538461538461641,0.001538461538461641,0.001538461538461641,0.001538461538461641,0.001538461538461641,0.001538461538461641,0.001538461538461641,0.001538461538461641,0.07846153846154157,0.001538461538461641,0.1520808759152515,0.001538461538461641,0.001538461538461641,0.001538461538461641,0.001538461538461641,0.001538461538461641,0.1996149014450952,0.001538461538461641,0.001538461538461641,0.001538461538461641,0.2819639062071356,0.001538461538461641,0.001538461538461641,0.001538461538461641,0.001538461538461641,0.001538461538461641,0.001538461538461641,0.001538461538461641,0.08112738112361716,0.001538461538461641,0.001538461538461641,0.001538461538461641,0.001538461538461641,0.001538461538461641,0.001538461538461641,0.001538461538461641,0.001538461538461641,0.001538461538461641,0.001538461538461641,0.001538461538461641,0.001538461538461641,0.001538461538461641,0.001538461538461641,0.001538461538461641,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

53082,2,"It 's called the Ultra Mini for a reason ! This review pertains specifically to the Targus PAUH217U 4 Port Ultra Mini USB 2.0 Hub . The cord is about 2.5 feet long - long enough to reach from my pc , which sits on the ground , to the top of the desk . It has a cable which is split into two USB plugs - one just to transmit data , the second to power the unit . The second plug does not need to be used unless you plan on using some heavy - duty hardware , and if so what are you buying a hub called the ultra mini for anyways ? If you insist on trying to run a blow dryer off the thing , then it does have an input for a separate power source , which you will have to buy separately . In short , If you have an old school machine with USB ports which are inaccessible /inconvenient to use , this little hub will give you quick access while taking up minimal space on your desk",186,1,0.0006060606060606522,0.0006060606060606522,0.0006060606060606522,0.0006060606060606522,0.08046036114540436,0.0006060606060606522,0.0006060606060606522,0.0006060606060606522,0.0006060606060606522,0.0006060606060606522,0.0006060606060606522,0.0006060606060606522,0.4212011365740216,0.0006060606060606522,0.03090909090909109,0.0006060606060606522,0.0006060606060606522,0.08967007574985073,0.0006060606060606522,0.0006060606060606522,0.0006060606060606522,0.0006060606060606522,0.04856053505621484,0.0006060606060606522,0.0006060606060606522,0.059533640980214915,0.0006060606060606522,0.0006060606060606522,0.0006060606060606522,0.0006060606060606522,0.0006060606060606522,0.0006060606060606522,0.0006060606060606522,0.0006060606060606522,0.0006060606060606522,0.0006060606060606522,0.0006060606060606522,0.0006060606060606522,0.0006060606060606522,0.0006060606060606522,0.0006060606060606522,0.06456157224690498,0.0006060606060606522,0.0006060606060606522,0.09572705213926727,0.0006060606060606522,0.08452805035054314,0.0006060606060606522,0.0006060606060606522,0.0006060606060606522,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0
53086,2,"Love satellite radio I got this for hubby and me over the summer . We used it for our trip to Rehoboth beach and we loved every minute of it . WE have a tape deck in the car and used it w/ a cassette adaptor . We had not problems whatsoever , in fact it sounds much better thru the cassette adaptor than over the fm transmitter . I did try it thru the fm transmitter and it was a pain to switch from one station to the next , but i do n't think anybody can improve upon that . I had the same problem w/ my itrip . We chose sirius for several reasons ... i liked the classic vinyl station , my dad introduced me to that and hubby likes nascar and this is switching over in 2007.The only problem i had was i could n't read the red lettering in the daylight w/ the sunglasses on , but i did n't give them less than 5 stars because of this . this is the way to go , plus it has a suction mount , not a permanent mount . also , if you look on ebay , someone is selling something to adapt your mount to the bolt on your car seat!!definitely go satellite , the music is great and little/ no commercials depending on the stations .",234,1,0.0007142857142857545,0.0007142857142857545,0.0007142857142857545,0.0007142857142857545,0.04731333189229461,0.036673340119259004,0.0007142857142857545,0.0007142857142857545,0.0007142857142857545,0.0007142857142857545,0.0007142857142857545,0.0007142857142857545,0.28358599217482017,0.0007142857142857545,0.0007142857142857545,0.0007142857142857545,0.0007142857142857545,0.0007142857142857545,0.0007142857142857545,0.11458062071671252,0.0007142857142857545,0.11177958581192551,0.07240274438591679,0.0007142857142857545,0.0007142857142857545,0.04442743773284563,0.11794176279447223,0.0007142857142857545,0.04613720825074752,0.0007142857142857545,0.0007142857142857545,0.0007142857142857545,0.0007142857142857545,0.0007142857142857545,0.0007142857142857545,0.0007142857142857545,0.0007142857142857545,0.0007142857142857545,0.0007142857142857545,0.0007142857142857545,0.0007142857142857545,0.0007142857142857545,0.0007142857142857545,0.0007142857142857545,0.0007142857142857545,0.0007142857142857545,0.09658654754957598,0.0007142857142857545,0.0007142857142857545,0.0007142857142857545,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

53123,2,"Great AM reception -- assume you 'll be buying new earphones I 'll try to keep this short and sweet . If you have been frustrated trying to get AM reception on the go , then you 've found the right radio for you . I ca n't tell you how many pieces of junk I 've bought that barely pulled - in even relatively close AM stations unless I constantly twisted the radio to the perfect angle needed to get reception . Luckily ( ? ) those other radios also died pretty quickly . This Sangean product solves the AM reception problem and seems very durable . I also own their CCRadio and this pocket product lives up to its reputation . I love the fact that it also gives you the option to broadcast through the built - in speaker , just like transistor radios of the 50 's and 60's -- a seemingly forgotten feature . As for listening through the supplied earphones , forget it . Sangean should be ashamed to ship this product with the utter junk earphones that are supplied . Never have I heard tinnier sound , even for AM listening . Not not mention that the cord is annoyingly short . I immediatey invested another $ 35 in decent pair of Koss earbuds and stored the supplied earphones in the neareast trash bin . Now I happily and easily listen to AM and FM stations even over the roar of the lawnmower .

53130,2,"Home Theater Solution The reviews sounded too good to be true . The reviews are right on . This system is perfect for home theater . I have the latest Panasonic plasma . This receiver is the perfect compliment . Here is why ... I could only start with at 2.1 set up - L / C / R and no sub woofer . Great digital sound effects with a one button switch to stereo for easy comparison . Tons of input / output connectors . Unless you need HDMI , the available connectors are perfect . The speaker connectors are screw down / banana plug type for easy , secure connection . Lots of component video , S - VHS and RCA video inputs . Lots of analog audio connections AND two digital coax and one optical . I use the digital coax for my DVD / CD and for my cable box . Really easy set up . I could assign inputs to the various selections through the front of the receiver . The manual is written in easy to understand language with lots of pictures . Did I mention the sound . Frys offers Polk Audio R15 for an indecently low price . With this receiver the sound is rich - great bass and treble without any tweaking of levels . Adding a Cerwin Vega center channel brought out the digital sound effects and this has them all . Best of all , my fashion master wife pulled the receiver out of the box before I got home and pronounced it beautiful . It was the only low profile receiver I could find that fit in the armoire we use as an enterntainment station . The end result - I sat down and just watched Hellboy for the first time all over again in the middle of the installation . All for less than the cost of me and the Missus going to the movies for a few weekends .

53164,2,"Great size , great price , great performance ... I am a success coach and I record all my coaching calls as a standard practice . This recorder has performed fantastically in all situations . I get about 9 - 12 continuous hours of battery operation ( depending on battery quality ) and the unit captures voices flawlessly during my calls ( I have an adapter for the phone ) . I have used this in a seminar setting and have had great results . I highly recommend using rechargeable batteries ( always have one extra on hand ) when you are going to use the unit for extended periods of time . Recharge before your event each day and you wo n't miss a thing . The unit only uses one battery and it 's always a great idea to have a spare . The unit does not audibly warn when the battery is about to expire , so keeping a fresh charge should provide you with uninterrupted recordings . Each stop and restart begins a new file . For me that works great ! If you are looking for one continuous file , do not shut it off . You can also buy software that will let you merge the files for your later use .

53166,2,"Good basic player I decided to replace my iRiver 190 T after a 3rd party cable adapter malfunctioned and fused the pin connection to the USB cable together . I wanted USB 2.0 for the faster connection and a larger capacity , but still desired standard user replaceable batteries on a flash based player so I picked this up on sale . I may still search for a used iRiver 190 T after playing with the Lyra RD2315 .

53180,2,"I just love this system I was paranoid about having buyer 's remorse from this unit . For such a cheap price I was sure I would end up regretting the purchase . What is the tradeoff ? Shoot if know , but I have n't regretted buying it one bit . The receiver is perfect for home theater , particularly DD 5.1 shows . There is absolutely no discernable speaker hiss with digital content , which is important for TV watching that has a high range of both loud and silent moments . As for power , it 's not an even match with some of the more power hungry and expensive analog amplifiers out there , but it easily crosses the threshold of annoying the neighbors . Digital is something to get used to . On conventional receivers , you turn the sound up high and it becomes somewhat sloppy , or what some call "" warm "" . Not so with the digital Panny . It 's distortion free up to very high levels . I would n't call it bright , but the response is very linear and precise . I like hearing all the details in music and cinema , even at loud volume . Others don't . The weaknesses are very minor:-The FM tuner is nothing special.-It lacks fancy DSP modes of expensive receivers.-No fancy on screen display ( must do most of the tweaking with knobs)-It does not upconvert video.-The remote control is an el cheapo .

53193,2,"Amazing PDA , Great Features at a Great Price ! I have had my Axim x51v for about three months . I purchased it from Dell for $ 480 with aluminum hardcase , extra 1100mAh battery , and auto power cord . Strengths : Just about everything . The processor is absolutely incredible . I heard ( unconfirmed ) that the Intel 624 MHz PXA270 is faster than a 2GHz Pentium 3 ! It sure seems like it . This PDA blazes through movies , photos , games , word processing , and anything else I can throw at it . The other definite high point for this PDA is the screen . Once you see a VGA screen like this , you will be astounded at the difference it can make over a QVGA screen . I have to get about 4 inches from the screen to even see the pixels . The screen is crystal clear . The battery life is phenomenal , even with the standard low capacity battery . Playing a movie at full brightness and full volume will last about 2 hours , extended to about 4.5 hours on low brightness and headphones . Turned off with a 1 GB SD card drains the battery about 2 % per day . WiFi is amazing . It connects consistently and is moderately easy to set up . Once connected , it keeps the signal well and is , while not fast , reasonable for speedJust about everything on this PDA is almost perfect . Weaknesses : Not enough programs to start with , Windows Media Player 10 ( Download TCPMP , it 's way better)Problems : Do n't use Odyssey Client , it makes the PDA start up really slow . Also , in ActiveSync , On the PDA , select Menu , Add Server Source . On all of the screens , put random characters in each field , and deselect any check boxes that tell it what to synchronize . Then go to menu , schedule and select manual for both . Then go to menu , options , and delete the entry that you just added ( the one that has no boxes under it checked ) and delete it . It fixes a myriad of problems and makes the PDA run faster , and it still syncs automatically in the cradle . Conclusion : An awesome PDA that does just about everything . Combine it with a BT keyboard and perhaps even a BT mouse , and you have an unbeatable combination of power and portability . Everything works extremely well",439,1,0.0002816901408451006,0.0002816901408451006,0.0002816901408451006,0.04338107624412284,0.059870037000270375,0.0002816901408451006,0.036782900710500534,0.0002816901408451006,0.1199049221574706,0.0002816901408451006,0.0002816901408451006,0.0002816901408451006,0.11895854440932689,0.0002816901408451006,0.0002816901408451006,0.0002816901408451006,0.0002816901408451006,0.0002816901408451006,0.0002816901408451006,0.0002816901408451006,0.11151983533862685,0.0002816901408451006,0.11088404502353862,0.0002816901408451006,0.0002816901408451006,0.05828537926124168,0.0002816901408451006,0.0002816901408451006,0.04969273780137516,0.0002816901408451006,0.0002816901408451006,0.0002816901408451006,0.0002816901408451006,0.0002816901408451006,0.0002816901408451006,0.0002816901408451006,0.0002816901408451006,0.0002816901408451006,0.0002816901408451006,0.10907154444369097,0.0002816901408451006,0.028450719496063488,0.10458969891713821,0.0002816901408451006,0.0002816901408451006,0.0002816901408451006,0.03818602398536534,0.0002816901408451006,0.0002816901408451006,0.0002816901408451006,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
53201,2,"Great mouse , mediocre keyboard . I wanted a combo and this seems to be the best one on the market now days . The mouse is very good , a tad small , but still very comfortable . Not as good as Logitech � MX(tm)500 for my hand ( I 'd say I have a medium size hand ) , but still a very solid product . Side buttons are very useful . No need to install any additional drivers for XP if you are ok with the default behavior . Just plug it in and use . The keyboard is so - so . It is not bad , but just not very comfortable , especially compared to Microsoft keyboards . ( I use Microsoft 4000 for work and it really shines ) .

53244,2,"Higher Quality Ink - jet Printable DVD discs These Verbatim discs have the DataLife Plus layer of protection that will allow them to last 100 + years . I 'm a professional photographer and it 's crucial to store my client 's digital photos and artwork onto a disc that will remain stable in years to come . I 've tried many brands and types of discs and have lost data ( read errors ) many times but so far with the hundreds of Verbatim discs I 've burned so far , I have n't had a problem yet . The Kodak brand discs were also excellent , but Kodak discontinued making them . SONY also makes a good disc .

53293,2,"It;s my baby ! I got my mini about nine monthes ago right before they were discontinued ( which , in my opinion , was a big mistake on Apple 's part ) and I absolutely love it ! Mine is pink , and the color is so nice , the design sleek and seamless all around . It 's smooth metal casing is really nice and different . The clickwheel is smooth and I have had no problems with it . It holds a little less than 1,000 songs due to different formatting , but it 's still a good amount ; iTunes is easily understandable and functional as well . The ipod mini is approx . 1/2 of an inch think and slides into pockets easily , while not being as flimsy as the nano feels to me . The clickwheel is a great and fast way to scroll through hundreds of songs , raher than , as on my brother 's mp3 player , needing to press "" next "" everytime you change the song . The backlight is fine , and does it 's job ; my one complaint on that would be that , as I mainly use it on the bus at 6:00 am , it is quite bright and hurts my eyes . Another huge plus to owning a member of the ipiod "" family "" is the countless accesories that have become availible exclusively to them . I myself have a case , an iSkin which I have come to adore , high quality headphones and the iBass , which is another great speaker product for ipods . I 've actually invested waay more on accessorites for my mini than it cost itself , but that 's how much I love it!For having so many great features , this is priced very reasonably . Even when I got it and it was $ 200 , I still felt that it was well worth the money .

53299,2,"Satisfied I have always run all of my media through my pc and my former speaker set ( a Midiland 5.1 system ) was thoroughly aged and falling apart I decided it was time to upgrade . I wanted something that had incredible sound with both music and dvd 's . I shopped around and came to the conclusion I would aim for the form factor speakers . When considering this bose system , this MUST be taken into account . First off , this system is expensive . For just under 1000 dollars ( does n't 999 sound sooo much better than 1 g ? ) you get 5 bi - directional midrange speakers , the subwoofer unit , and speaker cable . At this price it is very disappointing that bose does not include some sort of receiver , but no matter this leaves room for the customer to customize his / her choice to suit any personal needs and/or budget . Bose includes 3 colors ( white , silver , black ) and all the speakers are well packaged and aesthetically pleasing with the exception of the sub unit ( a large rectangular box meant to save space but does not ) . What brought me to look into this system was the specific size of the speakers and there general attractiveness . For their size the bose do a very good job of reproducing any sound - granted they are paired with a competent receiver . Anyone who has any qualms about this system should first consider what they are running their sound through , without competent equipment these speakers will not be on par with what you heard in the store . Once I got the system home it was very easy to set up and install . Bose packages the speakers with clear instructions and all of the wires are meant to be hidden and include markings as to what speakers they belong to - a very handy feature especially when one is trying to hide this system . The only serious issue I have with this system ended up being with my receiver ( an Onkyo ) and not related at all with the speakers . Since I do run this through my computer ( presently a laptop ) I had a few troubles setting up a new sound card and getting it too mesh with my receiver , but when that was all said and done , I was extremely please with the system . With a bose the tweaking one needs to do is very minimal and thus why this deserves the higher price tag - its target audience is usually those more affluent and unable to spend hours tweaking individual speaker levels and sound ranges . My test soundtracks included : Gladiator , Matrix ( II or III ) , Snatch , and music tracks ranging from techno , rock , classical , and alternative . Everything sounded great with enough low , high , and midrange response . The second complaint I have with this system is not differentiating in the least between any of the satellites . I found myself turning the response on the center channel up so the front speakers were n't drowning out the voices . That was solved with a little tweaking so nothing major there . All in all this speaker system is a great investment in my mind satisfying all of my needs ( though draining my bank account ) and providing me with great surround sound . Good : Great range and volume of sound . Easy set - up . Well built speakers - aesthetically and physically . No interference or feedback . Bad : Subwoofer awkward , no dedicated center channel , pricey , no included receiver . For their size these speakers more than compete with any full - blown tower 5.1 system . Here is one satisfied customer",661,1,0.11692844805083498,0.08393536593240433,0.01765602050386936,0.01065193124072171,0.07490322156165263,0.00020833333333336154,0.010696807234580802,0.00020833333333336154,0.00020833333333336154,0.00020833333333336154,0.1640134639540124,0.00020833333333336154,0.00020833333333336154,0.00020833333333336154,0.03145833333333573,0.00020833333333336154,0.06884609414146171,0.07897738413352791,0.00020833333333336154,0.00020833333333336154,0.00020833333333336154,0.00020833333333336154,0.03125122460733777,0.00020833333333336154,0.00020833333333336154,0.05256437160397566,0.00020833333333336154,0.00020833333333336154,0.1239686773605672,0.00020833333333336154,0.00020833333333336154,0.00020833333333336154,0.00020833333333336154,0.00020833333333336154,0.00020833333333336154,0.0218168258852196,0.00020833333333336154,0.010624999999998188,0.00020833333333336154,0.06932406076017303,0.00020833333333336154,0.00020833333333336154,0.00020833333333336154,0.00020833333333336154,0.00020833333333336154,0.00020833333333336154,0.025507769696326354,0.00020833333333336154,0.00020833333333336154,0.00020833333333336154,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

53311,2,"Great speaker value --lower cost , higher performance I recently began upgrading my home audio by buying at Ebay 2 pairs of JBL E20s and 1 Pair E30s , an E25 center speaker and a Harmon Kardon AVR . I got the first pair of e20s a week ago and the 2nd pair of E20s and the E30 yesterday and the remaining stuff should be delivered by the weekend . The E20s and E30s are listed as "" Bookshelf Speakers . "" The E20s ARE bookshelf speakers . As I wrote in my review of the E20s , the E30s can only be thought of as bookshelf speakers if you last name is Kong and your first name is King ! The E20s are heavy at 7lbs each , not flimsy little boxes as some cheapo bookshelves are . The E30s are HEAVY . HEAVY ! 16 lbs each . ( That is what my 7 qt lodge cast iron dutch oven weighs ! ) They are 15 inches high and 12 inches deep . They need to be placed on small end tables or speaker stands 18 to 24 inches off the floor . I am very pleased with both the E20s and E30s . For small speakers , the E20s have some oomph and can be cranked up . The E30s have OOOMMPHHHH . They WANT to be cranked up . Yesterday I tried them out by listening to my mp3 files of the Animals Singles and Paul Revere and the Raiders Kicks . When cranked up , the E30s sound at least 1000 % better than the the E20s . I hooked them up to my vintage JVC AV receiver circa 1989 that has 80 watts front and 20 watts rear power . At a little over half volume my ears began to hurt . You can really feel the bass and the drums kick . I also listened to about 2 hours of The Doors via Rhapsody with the audio out from my computer to the audio in on my receiver . I have been listening to this music since it was first played on the airwaves back in the 60s . The E30s are simply incredible ! They brought some very familiar tunes to life and made them new and fresh . My biggest surprise with the E30s is that they sound very good at lower volumes , not as good as the E20s , but still very good . As I write , I am watching / listening to a DVD of Vivaldi 's 4 Seasons concertos performed by Herbert Von Karajan , the BPO and Anne - Sophie Mutter on fiddle and am running the E30s and E20s at about 15 % volume -- pretty low since the 4 speakers are sharing the front 80 watts of my receiver . Yet I can still HEAR everything at low volumes including the resonating violins and the harpsacord . Since we normally do not rock the house down all the time and we do often listen at lower levels , I am very pleased at how good they sound without having to blow out my eardrums . I bought the E30s for under $ 90 including s / h . Back in the early 80s or late 70s I spent more than four times this amount ( adjusted for inflation ) for 2 large , heavy Advent Loudspeakers with 8 "" woofers . The E30s clearly sound better than I ever remember the Advents sounding including better bass response , and I liked the Advents ! Over time , our audio choices have gotten better and cheaper . You still can spend mega bucks and buy a $ 10,000 McIntosh system ( or even drop that much on a turntable magnetic cartridge as I saw at one website ! ) It all depends on what your budget is .

Seems like a capable product even if I did n't use the 108Mbps feature . However , be sure to update the firmware or the AP might not work correctly . When I first received it , configuration was easy enough but it had trouble working with my Netgear and HP Centrino notebook . Both notebooks will get a signal and even connect be failed to obtain an IP address from my network 's DNS server . A firmware upgrade solved the problem and the AP now streams TV realibly from my living room to the kitchen . I noticed that there is are hordes of wireless APs around my house , I guess most neighbours are using some form of 802.11 wireless as well .

53332,2,"Best 5.8GHz I 've tried though still not as good as 900 MHz DSS The sound quality is pretty darn good , except that if you pace around while talking / listening , there are these annoying clicking / scratching sounds . They are quite , and , if you stand still they go away . I 've had other phones that click / scratch while pacing around , and they actually dropped some of the sound during the clicking - at least this phone does n't do that . My 900 MHz DSS Uniden did n't have these sounds ( while pacing or otherwise ) , and still had greater range . I do n't know why the new technology ca n't measure up . Still though , this is the best 5.8 I 've tried . ( Yet I 'd rather buy another 900MHz DSS if there were any on the market anymore . All of today 's 900MHz are analog instead of digital.)Another annoying thing is that you ca n't recharge the phone with the belt clip attached , so the clip goes on and off ( and on and off ) . ( Many ( cell ) phones have a charger that allows this.)The plastic is a bit cheap . Do n't drop this phone .

53343,2,"WOW I wondered what kind of mouse I would get for $ 60 . I kept thinking , what could be so special about it . Well , I do n't know where to begin .

I used a Microsoft Explorer mouse prior and thought I 'd never find a mouse that was as comforable to use and had all the extra buttons I needed . This mouse completely puts the Explorer to shame .

That 's not why I got it , although it does look pretty cool . As for gaming , I really did n't notice much improvment in my skill but it REALLY does feel better in your hand . The bottom of the mouse it curved in so you can grip it much easier . My only negative comment towards it is how cheesy the driver and gui is for it as it looks "" homemade"" . I would highly recommend this mouse for anyone who spends any time at all on a PC",224,1,0.0004255319148936465,0.0004255319148936465,0.0004255319148936465,0.06734940477871033,0.0004255319148936465,0.02236343585264857,0.04440408987810007,0.0004255319148936465,0.0004255319148936465,0.0004255319148936465,0.0004255319148936465,0.046618516542734446,0.31311507613824274,0.0004255319148936465,0.0004255319148936465,0.0004255319148936465,0.10024806646679033,0.0004255319148936465,0.021701675198664064,0.0004255319148936465,0.0004255319148936465,0.08592731998844953,0.18602398688124883,0.0004255319148936465,0.0004255319148936465,0.0004255319148936465,0.0004255319148936465,0.0004255319148936465,0.0004255319148936465,0.0004255319148936465,0.0004255319148936465,0.0004255319148936465,0.0004255319148936465,0.0004255319148936465,0.0004255319148936465,0.0004255319148936465,0.0004255319148936465,0.0004255319148936465,0.0004255319148936465,0.0004255319148936465,0.0004255319148936465,0.0004255319148936465,0.0004255319148936465,0.0004255319148936465,0.0004255319148936465,0.0004255319148936465,0.09522715167866512,0.0004255319148936465,0.0004255319148936465,0.0004255319148936465,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

53352,2,"Very good standard SD card at an excellent price ! I recently bought a new 6.0 megapixel digital camera ( Canon PowerShot S3 IS ) which came with an extremely small and practically useless 16 MB secure digital card so I bought a couple of these 1 GB PNY PSD1GRF3 secure digital cards since they were on sale for less than $ 20 apiece . These SD cards are made in Japan by Toshiba ( they are then rebranded and sold by PNY , Lexar , DaneElec , etc . ) and I have been very pleased with them so far . They work flawlessly with no write - speed delay in my new camera while shooting still pictures or while shooting video with stereo sound , and the card reader in my HP Pavilion M7480N Media Center PC ( running Windows XP Professional service pack 2 ) reads the pictures and video into my Adobe Photoshop Elements 4.0 and Premiere Elements 2.0 software programs with no problems . The only drawback is that the read - speed on these standard SD cards is a bit slow when compared to the newer and faster SD cards ... it takes several minutes to transfer all the pictures or video from a full 1 GB card onto my PC ... but I find this to be a small inconvenience rather than a big problem . So , if a little longer read time is not a problem for you , then save yourself some money and buy this card . Overall , a very good standard SD card at an excellent price !",271,1,0.00037735849056606526,0.08205898461433436,0.00037735849056606526,0.00037735849056606526,0.00037735849056606526,0.01940604435289341,0.00037735849056606526,0.00037735849056606526,0.00037735849056606526,0.00037735849056606526,0.00037735849056606526,0.00037735849056606526,0.00037735849056606526,0.00037735849056606526,0.019245283018866514,0.00037735849056606526,0.00037735849056606526,0.1155104349199277,0.0381132075471714,0.00037735849056606526,0.00037735849056606526,0.00037735849056606526,0.10473058528988502,0.00037735849056606526,0.060553561968828,0.00037735849056606526,0.00037735849056606526,0.00037735849056606526,0.022159545893675626,0.019272397834110132,0.00037735849056606526,0.00037735849056606526,0.04144569987953473,0.00037735849056606526,0.00037735849056606526,0.00037735849056606526,0.08494569312490889,0.00037735849056606526,0.05292768422673935,0.0425587636780309,0.00037735849056606526,0.00037735849056606526,0.04277478213309795,0.00037735849056606526,0.00037735849056606526,0.0856108803746156,0.15585626246413412,0.00037735849056606526,0.00037735849056606526,0.00037735849056606526,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0

The player , radio ... can not be more than 4 "" high , 2.5 "" wide and .75 "" thick ; larger and you may not be able to zip closed the speaker case , which is necessary . My items just do fit .

53398,2,"Perfect for your laptop I 'm a Creative fan so these are the first Logitech speakers I ever bought and I was pleasantly surprised . I was looking for a set of speakers for my laptop but since the portable models are more expensive ( and probably will not sound as good since being portable means no sub - woofer ) I decided for this not - as - portable model . Well , these are perfect to keep on your desktop ( though the ideal placement of any sub - woofer is on the floor close to a corner ) , as it has a small sized sub - woofer all controls in one the speakers .

53402,2,"Does the job I purchased this dashmount so I could swap the GPS between vehicles without having to install a permanent mount . I do n't know what the "" feet "" of the base is made of , but it is basically like a rubber version of a lead blanket - it is heavy yet is very pliable . This is useful since my dash ( a 2004 F-250 ) has an uneven surface . I can press and mold the feet to put the base in a certain position and under most circumstances it 'll stay there . Occasionally , on long or "" bouncy "" trips , it 'll creep out of position a couple inches and I 'll have to move it back . I 've seen some comments complaining of that - but I do n't see it as a problem since common sense says it wo n't stay perfectly still since it is n't bolted in place . Overall this mount has worked very well . My wife is going on a business trip next week and will be borrowing the GPS - I do n't recommend she take the mount though - since the thing must way at least a couple pounds - too bulky and heavy to put in a suit case in my opinion",223,1,0.0005714285714286314,0.18738130481662157,0.0005714285714286314,0.07729201233739293,0.0005714285714286314,0.0005714285714286314,0.0005714285714286314,0.0005714285714286314,0.03547188287585283,0.0005714285714286314,0.0005714285714286314,0.02855831666019067,0.1247486164329982,0.0005714285714286314,0.0005714285714286314,0.0005714285714286314,0.04458481877986869,0.0005714285714286314,0.0005714285714286314,0.0005714285714286314,0.0005714285714286314,0.0005714285714286314,0.07289366434520597,0.0005714285714286314,0.0005714285714286314,0.0005714285714286314,0.0005714285714286314,0.0005714285714286314,0.0005714285714286314,0.0005714285714286314,0.0005714285714286314,0.0005714285714286314,0.0005714285714286314,0.0005714285714286314,0.0005714285714286314,0.0005714285714286314,0.0005714285714286314,0.0005714285714286314,0.0005714285714286314,0.0005714285714286314,0.0005714285714286314,0.0005714285714286314,0.03229676162214425,0.0005714285714286314,0.14653063906030195,0.2273848402122776,0.0005714285714286314,0.0005714285714286314,0.0005714285714286314,0.0005714285714286314,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0

53432,2,"My First MP3 Player~~Like it very much ! Let 's just say I am 39 and holding and have wanted an MP3 for years . My birthday was last week and I bought myslef the pink 4 GB Nano . It is easy to use , but I have to agree it takes some time on itunes to import CD 's , the ipod updates fast but the CD import is slow . The sound quality is good . I like that it is small and lightweight . The screen is bright and easy to read ... even with not so young eyes . I looked at other brands but am glad I went with the leader . I did n't need or want to watch movies on a tiny screen ... just tunes . I 'm sure 1000 songs will hold me . I looked all over at prices and Amazon wins ! The free shipping is a great bonus also . The case may look delicate but it feels very sturdy to me , I have had it in my pocket and it is just fine . Would highly recommend this MP3 . It is cute to boot !

53488,2,"No MP3 support but very high quality device I was mislead with Amazon review which said it supports conversion to MP3 format with the software supplied , it does not . The help quite clearly states "" You can not convert a file into an MP3 file "" . It will convert to .wav then you can use a 3rd party program to go to MP3.If it had MP3 support ( at least conversion on the PC from the Sony proprietary format which is .msv ) I would have given it 5 stars due to the good software supplied and the amazing sound quality possible . It you record in full quality mode ( 1.25 hours with built in 32meg memory ) and listen to it again with good headphones it does sound amazing . The Voice Up ( so you hear each person in a conversation ) works very well as do other nice features . But it is let down with the software supplied not performing MP3 conversion . Going to .wav then .mp3 with another program is a pain and simply converting to .wav to get away from proprietary .msv takes up too much space . But I would buy one again , as it is very easy to use , small , and very high quality .

53493,2,"You will need your own charger I bought this mouse and have used it for over a year now . The nice part about this mouse is the range and the fact that when it works , it works beautifully . When it does n't work , it is erratic and locks up . Turn it on and off and while the LED will light up , it will still not work well . This is the hint that the battery is low . The mouse comes with two rechargable NiMH AAA batteries . These are 650mAh batteries and are not the best . I bought 4 1000mAh AccuPower NiMH batteries . I keep 2 in the charger . These batteries work great and when fully charged will give me a month of use at about 8 hours a day . But as soon the mouse starts to get erratic , you have to swap the batteries . Do this and you will really like this mouse . Another nice feature for this mouse is the range . You can use your laptop as a DVD player connected to your TV and sitting out of the way . The mouse makes a nice remote control",205,1,0.00045454545454548555,0.18061267769307351,0.00045454545454548555,0.06799008104505043,0.0312907196288272,0.00045454545454548555,0.00045454545454548555,0.00045454545454548555,0.00045454545454548555,0.00045454545454548555,0.00045454545454548555,0.00045454545454548555,0.09529101235843804,0.00045454545454548555,0.00045454545454548555,0.00045454545454548555,0.00045454545454548555,0.0835305660391972,0.00045454545454548555,0.00045454545454548555,0.00045454545454548555,0.00045454545454548555,0.3775560091823201,0.03446771731376098,0.00045454545454548555,0.00045454545454548555,0.00045454545454548555,0.00045454545454548555,0.02989455239420881,0.00045454545454548555,0.00045454545454548555,0.00045454545454548555,0.00045454545454548555,0.00045454545454548555,0.00045454545454548555,0.00045454545454548555,0.00045454545454548555,0.00045454545454548555,0.00045454545454548555,0.08073030070875882,0.00045454545454548555,0.00045454545454548555,0.00045454545454548555,0.00045454545454548555,0.00045454545454548555,0.00045454545454548555,0.00045454545454548555,0.00045454545454548555,0.00045454545454548555,0.00045454545454548555,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
53494,2,Almost like prints from the photo shop This is a great printer . I have used it several times and it makes great pictures . I had some pictures taken at a low resolution and the print still turned out looking great . Tried this on a regular printer and the print did n't look near as great . A great feature is proof sheet print of the pictures you have . You can also add a border to your pictures which makes things nice for postcards . Colors are great and vivid . Also the prints look like that purchased from a photo shop . I have not tried printing to non Epson paper so I ca n't say how prints would look . I know that Epson printers look the best printed on Epson paper .,138,1,0.3067058840327729,0.0005882352941176844,0.0005882352941176844,0.0005882352941176844,0.2058790600740834,0.0005882352941176844,0.0005882352941176844,0.0005882352941176844,0.0005882352941176844,0.0005882352941176844,0.04303890565014196,0.0005882352941176844,0.20737723337789662,0.0005882352941176844,0.0005882352941176844,0.0005882352941176844,0.0005882352941176844,0.0005882352941176844,0.0005882352941176844,0.0005882352941176844,0.0005882352941176844,0.0005882352941176844,0.0005882352941176844,0.0005882352941176844,0.0005882352941176844,0.0005882352941176844,0.0005882352941176844,0.0005882352941176844,0.0005882352941176844,0.12038315334129676,0.0005882352941176844,0.0005882352941176844,0.04951999908898255,0.0005882352941176844,0.0005882352941176844,0.0005882352941176844,0.0005882352941176844,0.0005882352941176844,0.0005882352941176844,0.0005882352941176844,0.0005882352941176844,0.0005882352941176844,0.0005882352941176844,0.0005882352941176844,0.041801646787765295,0.0005882352941176844,0.0005882352941176844,0.0005882352941176844,0.0005882352941176844,0.0005882352941176844,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

53512,2,"The little details Ok , so I upgraded form a 30 inch LCD to a 50 "" Plasma screen , all the sales guys kept trying to get me to buy a power center . I came home did some research and chose this one , if it did n't improve sound or picture at least i knew that the equipment was protected from power surges . I hooked everything up last light and turns it one . OMG ! ! ! ! amazing , my Yamaha receiver and Wharfdale Diamonds 8.2 no longer sounded muddy but insted bright and even toned , the kick from the sub was tight no sloppy and precise , it turned a good system into an eye opener . The Sony progressive scan and LG plasma now are like looking at real people no a screen , the HD stiff is simply the best , digital cable it good and the dvd 's are quite near HD . All in all I would highly reccomend this to anyone . The blue light is quite bright but i placed a piece of blue painters tape over it and it is no longer a problem . the voltage meter light is adjustable and not an issue .

I borrowed one of these Logic3 amplified Ipod speaker systems for a weekend camping trip and was impressed with the sound and portability . I decided to buy one of my own after looked at several other makes and models all of which were more money . Plenty of connectivity along with base adapters to hold most Ipod models securely .

53518,2,"Invent it ! Iron - on transfers While thinking of ideas for my church 's 75th anniversary celebration , I decided to make T - shirts and sweatshirts using iron - on transfers and my ink jet printer . I chose the "" invent it ! "" brand from Hammermill papers because it was the most cost - effective ( cheapest ) . I created the design on my computer and tried it out on the transfer paper . The results were outstanding for a do - it - yourself project . I followed the instructions included with the transfers and it was a piece of cake . One thing that I did find out - keep the transfers dry after they have been printed . One got wet in the rain and it spotted very badly wherever a rain drop came in contact .

53545,2,"Apple 30 "" Cinema Display and PNY 6600GT I received it today , and it 's a monster . If you 've seen one in a store , it looks twice as big on your desk . Until a few hours ago , I was running two 20 "" aluminum cinema displays on a PNY 6600GT . After doing online research about using the 30 "" display under Windows XP , I found that the "" functional "" cheap solution being used is in fact the PNY 6600GT ( Verto 128 MB DDR3 with two DVI connectors ) . Considering that the other two most noted solutions , QuadroFX 4000 AGP or Parhelia DL256 PCI , are going for $ 600 + on ebay , I was willing to give my old beater a try . Besides , I did n't feel like buying another AGP card with PCIE taking over the world , or sacrificing the only PCI slot in my Shuttle XPC ( SB75G2).To my great relief , the monitor worked on the card right away , even showing me the POST and Windows start - up screen ( it did for the 20 "" displays , too ) . But to my absolute delight , the card is actually running both the 30 "" and a 20 "" in 32-bit color . The 20 "" looks absurdly small next to the 30 "" , like I did n't water it enough or something . The 30 "" is enormous enough that I think it might be better were it curved ! Maybe I 'm just sitting too close . The only problem with the 6600GT is that the DVI jacks are so near each other that I had to take the plastic housing off of the 20 "" plug to fit it below the 30 "" . I 'm not a gamer , so I ca n't say whether the card performs well for that . It feels as zippy as with the 20 "" on regular windowing tasks . I use Eclipse , Flash , Photoshop , etc . , but no video editing or 3D stuff . The screen had a slight warm cast that I did n't like . Nvidia 's control panel let me adjust it manually , and now my 30 "" and 20 "" look almost identical . My biggest fear was of course dead pixels . By the good grace of lucky ducks , this is the third panel I 've gotten from Apple with no dead pixels . Brightness is uniform but for a very very subtle drop in the far lower left and right edges . It 's not apparent unless you put white there and actively look for it . In any case , I bought it to get more programming panels on the screen at once , and it does a fine job at that . I 'm using the 20 "" for browsing and , alas , a few panels that STILL do n't fit . Apple , where 's 3840 x 2400 ? ? I strip one star cuz it 's crazy expensive .",530,1,0.12283698564801906,0.0002020202020202228,0.0002020202020202228,0.049032075888625674,0.0002020202020202228,0.0002020202020202228,0.0002020202020202228,0.0002020202020202228,0.05915263030333038,0.0002020202020202228,0.0002020202020202228,0.010743314873845548,0.12365446081867165,0.0002020202020202228,0.030505050505051846,0.0002020202020202228,0.09037058571545747,0.0002020202020202228,0.1517117550562392,0.0002020202020202228,0.0002020202020202228,0.0002020202020202228,0.0002020202020202228,0.02755056269930164,0.010055196876682654,0.0002020202020202228,0.028044577608794138,0.0002020202020202228,0.0002020202020202228,0.0002020202020202228,0.0002020202020202228,0.0002020202020202228,0.0288807760162769,0.0002020202020202228,0.0002020202020202228,0.010729556973776441,0.0002020202020202228,0.0002020202020202228,0.013208171869268625,0.0268612273451228,0.018067199934542207,0.0002020202020202228,0.012022301169758965,0.0002020202020202228,0.03011169015724849,0.05526751416514283,0.09513376031423686,0.0002020202020202228,0.0002020202020202228,0.0002020202020202228,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0

53549,2,"Good product within its limits If you understand this product 's limits before you buy it , you 'll be happy . It shows topographical contours , rivers and most streams for the entire United States . In addition to that , it shows roads that were in existance 10 - 20 years ago . These major roads are also named . The limit is that newer roads do n't show up . It also does n't support auto - routing , even if your GPS does . Garmin sells other products that are tailored for road navigation but you have to do some independant research or logical deduction to figure out that this package is n't suited for it . The product support could be better . Neither the manual nor web site tell you how to load all 3 CDs on your computer so you do n't have to swap CDs when transitioning between zones . The company 's web site does n't give a good explanation of what the software can and ca n't do . You'll be disappointed if your expectations are n't grounded in reality . Garmin could help alleviate this problem by making this information readily available",203,1,0.0005405405405406034,0.0005405405405406034,0.03343198385371705,0.029439687983917395,0.0005405405405406034,0.0005405405405406034,0.027567567567568837,0.0005405405405406034,0.0005405405405406034,0.0005405405405406034,0.11143356064516181,0.0005405405405406034,0.0005405405405406034,0.0005405405405406034,0.0005405405405406034,0.0005405405405406034,0.14235690079455302,0.11631162886242709,0.02756756756756894,0.0005405405405406034,0.0005405405405406034,0.0005405405405406034,0.16959872446851015,0.0005405405405406034,0.08657234244026972,0.0005405405405406034,0.0005405405405406034,0.0005405405405406034,0.0005405405405406034,0.0005405405405406034,0.0005405405405406034,0.0005405405405406034,0.0005405405405406034,0.0005405405405406034,0.0005405405405406034,0.0005405405405406034,0.0005405405405406034,0.0005405405405406034,0.0005405405405406034,0.0005405405405406034,0.1278176665092618,0.0005405405405406034,0.0005405405405406034,0.0005405405405406034,0.0005405405405406034,0.10682128822596057,0.0005405405405406034,0.0005405405405406034,0.0005405405405406034,0.0005405405405406034,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

53562,2,"SanDisk Is Reliable This card has been working great for me so far after over a month of heavy use . 512 MB is more than enough space for anyone with a 5 MB or less camera , assuming you transfer photos off your camera fairly regularly and are not shooting hundreds of photos at a time . With the 1200x1600p setting I use on my camera most often , this card holds over 400 photos , and it will hold even more for those using a more email - friendly setting .

53594,2,"Big Work Horse , Colors Just Right Having owned a 1280 for a year and a half thus far , I can say that this printer is for somone who wants a reliable and problem free large format printer that produces on target results . The drivers at least for Mac OS X are easy to understand and reliable . The ability to manage the printer such as doing a nozzle check and a head clean right from the application that is going to be printing , is a vey nice touch as well . However , it is the colors that this printer gets high reviews from me . By using mat or glossy photo paper and making the proper print settings , one can get nice rich colors that are on cue . Thus this printer makes good for doing proofs . As an artist and Graphic Designer , having this quality is a blessing since this print cost $ 400 at the time of parchase . Compare that to profesional quality workhorses going from $ 2000 on up . Also being able to print up to 13 x 19 save me loads of time since that cuts down on the number of trips to my local print service to have them do my print outs on there large format printers . The only minuses are that one needs a generous amout of desktop realestate to acomadate the 1280 as it is almost twice the size of a normal 8 1/2 x 11 printer . Also one needs be prepared to shell out some payolla as the ink cartriges can get pricey . But what inkjet dosen't have that problem ? Anyway that little expences is nullified by savings of not having to go to my print service so often . So any one looking for a good large format printer that produces some good printouts and not have to pay an arm and a leg for it , the 1280 is a very good cadadate for that job .

53602,2,"Fire and forget This was a breeze to setup , even with WPA2 to ensure privacy . I also hooked up an Xbox360 and it has never failed in since I bought it about 6 month ago . Much better value then your average gaming adaptor since it has multiple ports so you can hook up all your gizmos at the entertainment center rather then buying a wireless adaptor for each ( i.e. Tivo , PS2 , etc ... )I love it , and for the price , you could not beat it .",94,1,0.0025000000000001193,0.0025000000000001193,0.0025000000000001193,0.0025000000000001193,0.0025000000000001193,0.0025000000000001193,0.0025000000000001193,0.0025000000000001193,0.0025000000000001193,0.0025000000000001193,0.0025000000000001193,0.0025000000000001193,0.0025000000000001193,0.0025000000000001193,0.12750000000000403,0.0025000000000001193,0.0025000000000001193,0.147662165042634,0.0025000000000001193,0.0025000000000001193,0.0025000000000001193,0.0025000000000001193,0.0025000000000001193,0.0025000000000001193,0.0025000000000001193,0.172707549523577,0.0025000000000001193,0.0025000000000001193,0.0025000000000001193,0.0025000000000001193,0.0025000000000001193,0.0025000000000001193,0.0025000000000001193,0.0025000000000001193,0.14824590978865254,0.0025000000000001193,0.0025000000000001193,0.0025000000000001193,0.0025000000000001193,0.0025000000000001193,0.29138437564512726,0.0025000000000001193,0.0025000000000001193,0.0025000000000001193,0.0025000000000001193,0.0025000000000001193,0.0025000000000001193,0.0025000000000001193,0.0025000000000001193,0.0025000000000001193,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
53604,2,"A little pricy , but it was worth it . This is my first time ever buying a really expensive MP3 player . I bought it three weeks ago . If I had n't seen the Creative Zen Vision : M , I probably would have bought the Sandisk Sansa E260 . I love being able to bring my cartoon / tv shows over to a friends house so we can watch them on the tv . There is one problem I 've had with it . I 'm not sure if anyone else has had this , but there is some slight static noise that happens once in a while when I 'm listening to music . I do n't think it 's the MP3s , because I 've never ran into the problem with my other MP3 players .

53605,2,"Do n't overlook this player Earlier this week I received the factory referbished Samsung HD841 . I have had a few days to use it and compare it to my other players , mainly my Philips 642 , which have been excellent players for me . This Model does well . I do n't understand why this model has such a rough reveiw . Note , this model has the DVI output , If your TV has an HDMI port , you will want to check out the Samsung HD 850 ( identical otherwise ) . First , this model has component , composite and S - video hook ups , as well as the DVI port ( still have to run seperate sound out with DVI ) . Also , this model does feature digital coax sound out and optical sound out as well for systems that can handle 5.1 THX . Many upconvert models do not have the digital outs on lower priced models . The picture quality is great , at 480p comparable with my Philips . Again , The upconvert works well out the DVI hook up to my TV , but to be honest , it is hard to tell any difference between it and a good 480p progressive scan player , at least on my tv which is a 23 "" 720p LCD . Menus also are a bit difficult to figure out at first as well . The user manual is less than impressive at explaining thing , in fact , it does not have an index . But , it the main thing is that the player is does perform well , and is a name brand product from samsung ( I have had some offbrand experience and have had perfomace problems ) . THis player also appears to have DivX available on it , not noted in the product discription , so that was a suprise as well . This will allow the use of MP4 movie files . The remote again is bigger and at first more difficult than my other players , but after a day or so it actually is better because many of the features are available to change at the push of a button instread of going through the menus . In all , I will continue to explore this new player , but in all it seems to be a quality product that has received some bad flack . So give it a chane , the prices are good currently , quality has been good , and it is a Samsung . Note to the technosavy : I have not had luck using the component upconvert code that is available on other web sites , so I am using my DVI input for upconvert . Also , the new Blue ray ( HD 1080p ) DVD players are out , so if you have the expensive hi res tvs that can handle this , you might want to wait and save till you can get the new DVD players . Note 2 : the factory referbished models come with a DVI cable , a 20 - 30 dollar value that many do n't come with",540,1,0.0002325581395349038,0.06171943250093748,0.05766735884760622,0.09046820501519023,0.0002325581395349038,0.0002325581395349038,0.0002325581395349038,0.0002325581395349038,0.0002325581395349038,0.0002325581395349038,0.04376573350270666,0.0235206951926201,0.0002325581395349038,0.0002325581395349038,0.0002325581395349038,0.0002325581395349038,0.12480942055801313,0.07208100730118502,0.023422196911781143,0.0002325581395349038,0.018549385967463593,0.0002325581395349038,0.0002325581395349038,0.02189361005539427,0.0002325581395349038,0.01766113621961666,0.0002325581395349038,0.0002325581395349038,0.056129959433474555,0.026070662899436096,0.0002325581395349038,0.0002325581395349038,0.0002325581395349038,0.0002325581395349038,0.04093810028925392,0.0002325581395349038,0.0002325581395349038,0.0002325581395349038,0.057848869508399826,0.18664737772164047,0.0002325581395349038,0.0002325581395349038,0.0002325581395349038,0.0002325581395349038,0.0002325581395349038,0.02014272829654402,0.04922225931361982,0.0002325581395349038,0.0002325581395349038,0.0002325581395349038,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0
53609,2,"Very pleased This unit works very well and we are very pleased with it . Nice construction , good sound quality on both ends . We 're concerned about battery life as in # of recharges before performance decreases , but no indication right now that is an issue . I would have give the product 5 stars if it had been cheaper . This class of device is overpriced in general . Amazon 's price was very good , but overall still seems over priced . I would definately buy another from Amazon as these are 25 % more at other places .",104,1,0.000952380952381,0.11052360738869942,0.25791574477035395,0.000952380952381,0.000952380952381,0.000952380952381,0.000952380952381,0.000952380952381,0.000952380952381,0.000952380952381,0.044881611774053566,0.000952380952381,0.000952380952381,0.000952380952381,0.000952380952381,0.000952380952381,0.000952380952381,0.11648216861649009,0.000952380952381,0.000952380952381,0.000952380952381,0.000952380952381,0.14763264331976175,0.000952380952381,0.000952380952381,0.000952380952381,0.000952380952381,0.000952380952381,0.0521695534139746,0.18182324214524395,0.000952380952381,0.000952380952381,0.000952380952381,0.000952380952381,0.000952380952381,0.000952380952381,0.000952380952381,0.000952380952381,0.04857142857142083,0.000952380952381,0.000952380952381,0.000952380952381,0.000952380952381,0.000952380952381,0.000952380952381,0.000952380952381,0.000952380952381,0.000952380952381,0.000952380952381,0.000952380952381,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1
53626,2,Unexpected Awesomeness I am a audiophile and am very picky when it comes to buying my toys . I bought these by accident when i was acually trying to buy the hd650 's it was too late to cancell my order and since it was half the price i decided to try them out . I first hooked them up to my denon amp and listened to some cds and they sounded awesome . i could hear things in songs i have never heard before . I then hooked them up to my cheapy portable philips cd player just to see what it would sound like . to my surprise it sounded just as good as hooking them up to my denon amp . There was plenty of bass and highs and mids came out very good . the only draw back is that it is open and it bugs people that are sitting close to you . I am glad i got these instead of the 650 's cause my friend owned the 650 's and if you do n't have a amp hooked up to it your out of luck,192,1,0.38201706301135235,0.05071874433988236,0.0007142857142857688,0.0007142857142857688,0.0007142857142857688,0.0007142857142857688,0.0007142857142857688,0.0007142857142857688,0.0007142857142857688,0.0007142857142857688,0.0007142857142857688,0.0007142857142857688,0.0007142857142857688,0.0007142857142857688,0.07214285714286132,0.0007142857142857688,0.0007142857142857688,0.3742805354704614,0.0007142857142857688,0.0007142857142857688,0.0007142857142857688,0.0007142857142857688,0.0007142857142857688,0.0007142857142857688,0.0007142857142857688,0.0007142857142857688,0.0007142857142857688,0.0007142857142857688,0.04143318737755743,0.0007142857142857688,0.0007142857142857688,0.0007142857142857688,0.0007142857142857688,0.0007142857142857688,0.0007142857142857688,0.0007142857142857688,0.0007142857142857688,0.0007142857142857688,0.0007142857142857688,0.0479790412293114,0.0007142857142857688,0.0007142857142857688,0.0007142857142857688,0.0007142857142857688,0.0007142857142857688,0.0007142857142857688,0.0007142857142857688,0.0007142857142857688,0.0007142857142857688,0.0007142857142857688,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
53634,2,"Linksys PAP2 I am going to strictly comment on the Linksys PAP2 . A lot of the reviews on here have been for the Vonage service . The Linksys PAP2 is NOT THE Vonage service , but one of many adapters you can use . I am extreamly satisfied with my Linksys PAP2 . It is small , light weight , and perfect for those who need to travel . The voice quality is excellent and people say I do not sound like I am talking over VOIP . There is no line noise , static , popping , etc . I am giving this product 4 stars . Why ? Because there is only ONE ethernet port . If you have a router , just connect the PAP2 to one of your available ethernet ports and you are good to go . If you do not have a router , consider getting another Vonage phone adapter with built in 4-port router .

53680,2,"My last "" jump drive "" I had a small 512 Sandisk a while back , so when I saw a review for the Titanium 2 GB Cruzer in a popular computer mag , I decided to upgrade from my Lexar 1 GB . So far , I 'm very impressed . Just did a 1.26 GB transfer that took 140 seconds . I was a big leery of the included software , but was pleased to see that if I did n't care for it , it was easily removed . I have not had an issue with either the software or the drive , and am very impressed with the design of the retractable interface that requires pressure to expose or retract . This is a very good drive , and contrary to the negative comments , I would encourage anyone looking for a fast , stylish , practical jump drive to seriously conside the Titanium Cruzer",159,1,0.0008333333333333907,0.0008333333333333907,0.0008333333333333907,0.0008333333333333907,0.0008333333333333907,0.04407255500374995,0.055884876614482354,0.0008333333333333907,0.04876886765502762,0.0008333333333333907,0.0008333333333333907,0.0008333333333333907,0.0008333333333333907,0.0008333333333333907,0.0008333333333333907,0.0008333333333333907,0.0008333333333333907,0.0008333333333333907,0.0008333333333333907,0.0008333333333333907,0.0008333333333333907,0.0008333333333333907,0.08440309277929942,0.0008333333333333907,0.04573672145840415,0.0008333333333333907,0.0008333333333333907,0.0008333333333333907,0.0008333333333333907,0.060559293982836666,0.0008333333333333907,0.0008333333333333907,0.0838982412432923,0.0008333333333333907,0.0008333333333333907,0.0008333333333333907,0.0008333333333333907,0.0008333333333333907,0.0008333333333333907,0.0008333333333333907,0.0008333333333333907,0.16750000000000934,0.0424999999999994,0.0008333333333333907,0.3333430179295633,0.0008333333333333907,0.0008333333333333907,0.0008333333333333907,0.0008333333333333907,0.0008333333333333907,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

53719,2,"Excellent value I 've gone through a ton of headphones in recent years . They 've included Koss "" The Plug , "" Sennheiser PX100 , Koss UR29 , Koss SportaPro and a few others . All had their strong and weak points . So far , this has been the closest I 've had to a good balance . For my tastes ( not necessarily anybody else 's ) , strong bass is one of the most important things . The PX100 felt very weak in this area , despite what everybody else seemed to say -- weaker than my old Sony MDR - NC20 ( which are still going strong after 6 years and remain my backup headphone of choice thanks to their decent sound and folding ability ) . I had problems keeping "" The Plug "" sealed in my ears , despite the "" hold the outer ear while the Plug seats "" advice . They 're also a very a bad choice for iPods because their very low impedance overdrives the amplifier circuit . The SportaPros had great bass , but leaked way too much sound . The UR29 had good bass and very good isolation , but were a little uncomfortable , warm , heavy and too bulky to use on the go . Going back a few years , I had a pair of AKG K240s that had disappointing bass . Ditto for a pair of Sennheiser HD-420s . The K26P seems to combine the better aspects of all these phones . The bass is among the strongest . When I listen to the 1812 Overture , the "" cannon blasts "" come through loud and clear , even at moderately low volumes , with no distortion at all . Isolation is n't as good as the UR29 , but not too bad . Certainly a lot more portable , easy to stow in my bag at all times . The PX100s fold smaller , but they 're a pain in the neck to stow in their hard case . The higher efficiency of the K26P means I can set my iPod at a lower volume . Instead of 55 - 60 % of max volume with the UR29 or the stock earbuds , I now run at 35 - 40 % comfortably . In terms of comfort , they 're comfortable enough for hours of wearing , after a couple of slight modifications . If they press too hard on your hears , first extend the headband all the way , then GENTLY straighten each half a little bit by gripping a couple of inches of steel band at a time and unbending it . After a few tries , it should be perfectly fitted to your head . Do n't bend too hard or grip the plastic parts or you can break the phones . Be patient . So it takes a couple of days of trial and error , but in the end , you get good - sounding phones that are wonderfully comfortable . You 'd be surprised how little pressure is needed to produce a good seal . You 'll know if you 've unbent too far because either the phones will slide down or you lose bass . Here 's an easy test : with a finger on each side , press the earcups harder onto your ears . If the bass does n't get stronger as you press ( the way it does with all open - air headphones ) , that 's as good a seal as you need . I hated the little , square foam pads on the plastic sliders and quickly peeled them off . All they seem to do is create two pressure points on top of the head . Other phones with similar headbands ( like the Koss SportaPro / PortaPro ) do n't use these pads , so I do n't think they 're really necessary . Better to let the headband rest directly on the scalp and distribute the pressure over the entire headband , and so far my suspicions seem to have been correct . It has been far more comfortable for me without the pads , especially after more than half an hour . In fact , without the pads , I barely feel the headband at all . Overall , I 'm satisified , especially at its low price point . I hope to use these for many years to come until either they break or something better comes along . By the way , do n't be put off by comments about the warranty being invalid in the US and Canada . Read the whole warranty sheet !

53723,2,"Inexpensive , Great Performer , Outstanding Value I initially purchased this model then returned it in favor of the Sony SRF - M37V because of its five one - button pre - sets which make it a no - brainer to use while exercising . However , the SRF-59 , perhaps because of its analog tuning , suffers less from co - channel and adjacent channel interference on FM . It 's audio is slightly brighter and more musical with a decent pair of headphones or earbuds than its digitally tuned cousin . With this in mind , I purchased another SRF-59 yesterday and spent all last evening listening to it . I literally could not make myself shut it off and go to bed I was having so much fun scanning the FM dial . There was a program which aired last night on a local channel which featured bass - heavy 12 "" remixes of eighties new wave hits with , blessfully , very limited commercial interruption . Over the course of a three hour listening session , I gradually cranked up the volume . As I was too lazy to fish out decent earbuds , it became apparent that with bass - heavy audio at very loud volumes the SRF-59 's tiny amplifier was insufficient to drive stock Walkman style headphones and peak audio was clipped which simply necessitated turning the volume down a tad to restore full musicality ( I understand that decent quality earbuds require less power to achieve the same level of high sound output , therefore there will be no audio clipping ) . Nevertheless , the sound quality from this bargain - priced Walkman through less than ordinary headphones was astounding . The party is literally in your head , and the soundstage ranges from ear to ear , which is somewhat disconcerting when it is located above your sinuses . I also made one pass through the AM band and there the SRF-59 was no slouch either . I hauled in 1200 WOAI San Antonio which is approximately 1000 miles from me . Though no true DX machine , after all how could it be , it is at the least a competent performer on the AM band as well ( I suspect early in the evening AM DXing conditions were as good as they have been in a long time ) . For more on this model and others visit Xin Feng 's website . I highly recommend this model for cheap thrills !",424,1,0.16304600730563787,0.16563798313351863,0.0811036399049784,0.07497483043663236,0.04165306238152963,0.0004347826086956898,0.0004347826086956898,0.0004347826086956898,0.0004347826086956898,0.0004347826086956898,0.12577524388583022,0.03544391622890595,0.0004347826086956898,0.0004347826086956898,0.0004347826086956898,0.0004347826086956898,0.0004347826086956898,0.0004347826086956898,0.0004347826086956898,0.0004347826086956898,0.0004347826086956898,0.0004347826086956898,0.0004347826086956898,0.0004347826086956898,0.0004347826086956898,0.0004347826086956898,0.0004347826086956898,0.0004347826086956898,0.1299229827128463,0.0004347826086956898,0.0004347826086956898,0.0004347826086956898,0.05869236264992568,0.0004347826086956898,0.06024288821222211,0.0004347826086956898,0.0004347826086956898,0.0004347826086956898,0.0004347826086956898,0.0004347826086956898,0.0004347826086956898,0.04655056140884119,0.0004347826086956898,0.0004347826086956898,0.0004347826086956898,0.0004347826086956898,0.0004347826086956898,0.0004347826086956898,0.0004347826086956898,0.0004347826086956898,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

53862,2,"Solid keyboard and mouse I 've used the keyboard / mouse for a little over a month now and have generally found it to do all I would wish . Of course , any wireless keyboard will at times not be as responsive as a wired keyboard / mouse setup , but this is more than offset by the lack of wires and the ability to pull the keyboard to wherever I wish . The only drawback , and it is minor , is getting used to the fact that there are no lights on the keyboard to indicate when CAPS LOCK or NUM LOCK is on . I have to look over at the wireless receiver for this . Additionally , it would be nice if there was an option for the keyboard to be backlit . Yes , it would draw down batteries more quickly , but as an option it would be user selected . All in all , a good wireless keyboard / mouse combination , and one I am quite glad I purchased .

I 'm watching ( and listening to ) "" Batman Begins "" ( In True HD sound ) on HD DVD and it is superb ! ! ! ! This is just awesome ! The stuff of fantasy . You only have to buy this / these cables once , so why not buy the BEST ? ! I highly recommend this move .",185,1,0.0006250000000000322,0.11013982791150097,0.0006250000000000322,0.0006250000000000322,0.0006250000000000322,0.0006250000000000322,0.0006250000000000322,0.0006250000000000322,0.034842610606771546,0.0006250000000000322,0.0006250000000000322,0.05879404924153724,0.0006250000000000322,0.0006250000000000322,0.0006250000000000322,0.0006250000000000322,0.0006250000000000322,0.3860723980098022,0.0006250000000000322,0.0006250000000000322,0.0006250000000000322,0.0006250000000000322,0.0006250000000000322,0.0006250000000000322,0.0006250000000000322,0.0006250000000000322,0.0006250000000000322,0.0006250000000000322,0.12332738436649907,0.03233895047356658,0.0006250000000000322,0.0006250000000000322,0.0006250000000000322,0.0006250000000000322,0.0006250000000000322,0.0006250000000000322,0.0006250000000000322,0.0006250000000000322,0.0006250000000000322,0.0808423146333154,0.0006250000000000322,0.0006250000000000322,0.0006250000000000322,0.0006250000000000322,0.14739246475700563,0.0006250000000000322,0.0006250000000000322,0.0006250000000000322,0.0006250000000000322,0.0006250000000000322,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0
53877,2,"Wireless on the Desktop I just recently move from dial - up to DSL . Going DSL was not enough ; I did not want to have cables running though the house so I started looking into going wireless . To make a long story short , after a little investigation I decided to make the leap into wireless technology . I purchased the WAP55AG router and the adapter cards , WMP55AG and WPC55AG.Once the WAP55AG router was installed and set up , the installation of the WMP55AG PCI Adapter on each of the desktops were simple . I had no difficulty setting up the hardware and software and with a few hours , I was on the net through the router . One desktop is running XP professional and the other desktops are running XP Home edition . The LinkSys Web site has all the documentation you need for installation and setup . There is a "" Knowledge Base "" page that covers a lot of the products and answers to a lot of questions about various products and configurations ; I found it to be very helpful . Pulled from LinkSys Web Site:----------------------------------------The Linksys Dual - Band Wireless A+G PCI Adapter installs in most desktops and lets you put your computer almost anywhere in the building , without the cost and hassle of running network cables . Now you do n't have to drill holes in your walls and climb through the attic or cellar to get connected to the network . Once you 're connected , you can keep in touch with your e - mail ; access the Internet , use instant messaging to chat with friends , and share files and other resources such as printers and network storage with other computers on the network . The Dual - Band Wireless A+G PCI Adapter connects you with Wireless - A ( 802.11a ) and Wireless - G ( draft 802.11 g ) networks at an incredible 54Mbps ! And for added versatility , it can also interoperate with all the 11Mbps Wireless - B ( 802.11b ) products found in homes , businesses , and public wireless hotspots around the country . And whichever mode you choose , your wireless communications are protected by up to 152-bit encryption , so your data stays secure . Features of the product:--------------------------------One adapter connects to either 2.4 GHz ( 802.11b or draft 802.11 g ) or 5 GHz ( 802.11a ) networksAdvanced security features with up to 152-Bit WEP encryptionDetailed monitoring and performance utilityIEEE 802.11a , 802.11b and draft 802.11 g compliant System Requirements ( Minimum):---------------------------------------------200MHz of Faster Processor64 MB RAMAvailable PCI SlotCD - ROM DriveWindows 98SE , Me , 2000 or X",455,1,0.0004761904761905168,0.14017924796943237,0.0004761904761905168,0.026483433741669685,0.0004761904761905168,0.0004761904761905168,0.07251553392788246,0.0004761904761905168,0.0004761904761905168,0.0004761904761905168,0.08733023970679231,0.0004761904761905168,0.0004761904761905168,0.0004761904761905168,0.09571428571429202,0.0004761904761905168,0.0004761904761905168,0.0004761904761905168,0.0004761904761905168,0.02880869864516902,0.0004761904761905168,0.0004761904761905168,0.11852406207006216,0.0004761904761905168,0.0004761904761905168,0.028860399076125202,0.0004761904761905168,0.0004761904761905168,0.0004761904761905168,0.0004761904761905168,0.0004761904761905168,0.0004761904761905168,0.0004761904761905168,0.0004761904761905168,0.04544368694982512,0.0004761904761905168,0.0004761904761905168,0.0004761904761905168,0.0004761904761905168,0.0004761904761905168,0.0004761904761905168,0.0004761904761905168,0.023554139194737683,0.0004761904761905168,0.3140148444325819,0.0004761904761905168,0.0004761904761905168,0.0004761904761905168,0.0004761904761905168,0.0004761904761905168,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

53904,2,"Driving worry free This is my second Escort Passport 8500 X50 . The first one is in another car . It saved me many times for getting caught though I 'm not maniac driver . The detection range is very good , it gives you plenty time to adjust your speed before you see the police car . I love the blue color and it only costs $ 30 more than red . The only problem that I have experienced on my first one is sometimes I got laser false warning signals , especially on raining day with defog is on . I heard someone mentioned that turbo charged car can causes X50 Pop and Laser false warning signals , and my first X50 is in my turbo charged car . I 'm not sure if Pop alerts were false but since it wo n't help much , I have it turned off .

53937,2,"Excellent webcam - no video lag - superior clarity I tried both Microsoft 's LifeCam VX-3000 and VX-6000 . Had 'em both home and ran trials with my Intel Pentium D Dual Core 3.00GHz CPU with 2 gigs of ram and , with both of those , the video lagged the audio ( distractingly so ) . Spent the better part of an hour on the phone with a friendly Microsoft customer service rep one evening ( got through on their toll free line)and he pointed me to new software for the VX-6000 . Downloaded the 50 meg plus file , installed it , but the VX-6000 still produced out - of - sync video vs. audio when I created a simple 640 by 480 video file for viewing on Media Player or editing in Windows Movie Maker . So , I talked to some technicians at our company and then talked to the webcam guru at the local assembler that built my , I believe , excellent computer . All recommended Logitech when buying webcams . I then marched back to Best Buy and traded my $ 99 Microsoft VX-6000 for a Logitech Quickcam Orbit MP for BB 's price of $ 139.95 . You can find this Logitech unit cheaper all over the place , including , of course , here at Amazon . The package I bought included an inexpensive headset , which I have n't used so far . Although I have n't tried the Orbit in a video phone call yet , from the moment I turned it on I had that satisfing good feeling that I bought a winner . Installed fairly easily with a couple of bumps . Got a "" USB composite device has not passed Windows Logo testing "" screen a couple of times .. BUT .. I received the SAME screen on , get this , the Microsoft cams ! I just continued installing and have not experienced system problems so far . The audio sync with video in making a recording is right on ( remember , that was primary reason for taking back the Microsoft cameras ) AND the picture clarity on my LCD flat panel monitor at the 640 webcam capture setting produced a gorgeous picture . Excellent detail and smoothness of video . Besides the superior audio sync with video , the Orbit MP is remarkably better than the VX-6000 and way above the $ 49 Microsoft VX-3000 in all other criteria too , in my opinion after comparison testing . The Orbit 's special effects are interesting and fun . The pan , tilt , etc . , excellent . The face tracking is vigorous and alive - fun to watch the little Orbit camera turn - but I have n't tested in actual live conferencing yet . All in all - for webcams , I 'm now saying what more experienced webcam users told me - head for Logitech . They 've certianly hooked me with their apparent superior performance . The Orbit MP is a keeper ! Not going to waste anymore time searching and testing . And , my advice to Microsoft , you 'd better talk to the outfit that bought your name for those Lifecams .

Its many pockets and nooks are ideal for carrying and organizing just about everything I need . As a chronically disorganized person , the bag helps me maintain some sense of organization and order in my belongings . The strap is nicely padded and it 's elastic , so shocks are well absorbed . A nice touch is a zippered ' cavity ' at the top , which is an ideal place to store a laptop charger . The build quality seems excellent so far - it looks to be a very durable product .

53996,2,"CANON 'S BEST VALUE FOR PHOTO PRINTING ... TRULY AMAZING I have the Canon MP500 printer and Canon Rebel XT camera - both capable of producing amazing results , but paper makes a HUUUUGE diference in photo printing . I have both the Canon Photo Plus Glossy and the Photo Pro papers . If you are looking to print out very impressive photos , then I would recommend getting the 8x10 Photo Plus Glossy - definitely nice enough to frame . And with Plus glossy , you 're definitely saving $ instead of paying $ $ $ to have professional photos done at a professional or retail store . And I even scanned a professional photo that I had done last year with my MP500 and printed using Plus Glossy , and the print is significantly better than the original . Pros : Best Value Canon has to offer . Great , great prints , my favorite paper overall . As good as Pro , and less expensive . About 55 cents per page in a 30 page pack of Pro compared to 40 cents per page in a 20 page pack of Plus . Cons : None at all so far . have not seen if photos last over time",211,1,0.00048780487804882624,0.051159587719465174,0.00048780487804882624,0.00048780487804882624,0.04839799720885385,0.00048780487804882624,0.12118075122011136,0.00048780487804882624,0.00048780487804882624,0.00048780487804882624,0.00048780487804882624,0.045919325842843424,0.00048780487804882624,0.00048780487804882624,0.00048780487804882624,0.00048780487804882624,0.00048780487804882624,0.04128223872300316,0.049207213670777517,0.00048780487804882624,0.00048780487804882624,0.00048780487804882624,0.00048780487804882624,0.11083325190476111,0.00048780487804882624,0.00048780487804882624,0.00048780487804882624,0.00048780487804882624,0.00048780487804882624,0.00048780487804882624,0.00048780487804882624,0.00048780487804882624,0.38982367602193824,0.00048780487804882624,0.00048780487804882624,0.00048780487804882624,0.1221959576882443,0.00048780487804882624,0.00048780487804882624,0.00048780487804882624,0.00048780487804882624,0.00048780487804882624,0.00048780487804882624,0.00048780487804882624,0.00048780487804882624,0.00048780487804882624,0.00048780487804882624,0.00048780487804882624,0.00048780487804882624,0.00048780487804882624,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

54066,3,"Thin Sheets That Curl and Buckle in the Oven - YUK ! I ordered 3 ( 2x ) sets of these so that I would have a full complement of 6 cookie sheets . When they arrived , I noted that they were a bit lighter than the commercial quality cookie sheets that I had used previously , but my thinking was that if they baked well , that was all that counted . I always bake with an Exopat silicone mat on my sheets . Upon the first use , when they were placed in the oven , the edges of the cookie sheets turned up about a quarter of an inch - an ominous sign that the sheets are too thin . The next thing I heard was the tap tap tap of sheets buckling in the oven . Lack of dimensional stability at 350 degrees F translates to poor heat conduction , and burned cookie bottoms . This symphony of metal buckling , courtesy of my new $ 15 cookie sheets . Even with the Exopat silicone sheets on them , the cookies were barely done when I decided to pull them from the oven to save the bottoms from getting burned - typical of cheap , thin cookie sheets that one knows one needs to "" double pan "" to prevent burning . What a wonderful situation Amazon has presented me with - $ 90 and a garbage can full of cookie sheets . Yes , into the garbage all six sheets went - no matter how costly , its even more so to live with poor quality baking implements and invent work - arounds to augment their performance . These are no better than inexpensive supermarket cookie sheets - actually they 're worse - with the price - point of supermarket wares , one can infer the quality that one is getting . I used to believe brands like Calphalon stood for quality , and this translated into some assurance that products bearing premium names would be of , at least , mezzanine quality . When I buy on the web and can not better scrutinize the items I 'm choosing , I tend to favor trusted brands . As it turns out , these sheets did not have the Calphalon name on them anywhere - Calphalon apparently made the decision to buy up a bunch of cheap -Made in China- cookie sheets and sell them at a premium price by leveraging the Calphalon brand . With the holiday baking season upon us , what do I plan to replace them with ? The Vollrath cookie sheets ( not non - stick , but I use silicone mats , so do I care ? ) recommended in Cooks Illustrated magazine . They 're in stock at Chef Resource - their price everywhere is $ 19 but most vendors are out of them . They 're due to arrive via UPS day after tomorrow - Tuesday , 10/17 . Holiday baking is much too sacred a tradition to be left in the hands of Calphalon , apparently . If I could give them no stars or provide an icon of 6 sheets going into the trash , I would so rate them .",547,0,0.3011289099874196,0.0003030303030303312,0.1568551397848483,0.023489696873908443,0.0003030303030303312,0.0003030303030303312,0.0003030303030303312,0.0003030303030303312,0.0003030303030303312,0.0003030303030303312,0.0003030303030303312,0.04145948805311395,0.04872005032299653,0.0003030303030303312,0.0003030303030303312,0.0003030303030303312,0.0003030303030303312,0.08616000925197843,0.0003030303030303312,0.0003030303030303312,0.0003030303030303312,0.0003030303030303312,0.0003030303030303312,0.0003030303030303312,0.0003030303030303312,0.0003030303030303312,0.0003030303030303312,0.0003030303030303312,0.01816360028823606,0.037717366659660294,0.0003030303030303312,0.0003030303030303312,0.0489365631909049,0.0003030303030303312,0.0003030303030303312,0.0169040474204638,0.0003030303030303312,0.0003030303030303312,0.0003030303030303312,0.0003030303030303312,0.07126250128281268,0.0003030303030303312,0.0003030303030303312,0.0003030303030303312,0.06248672816838908,0.0003030303030303312,0.07550377750314595,0.0003030303030303312,0.0003030303030303312,0.0003030303030303312,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0
54074,3,"Save your money I bought this to replace my old Mouli grater which finally bit the dust . Big mistake . It is sturdy and reasonably well designed , but the grating surfaces barely work at all , or at least mine did n't . To get it to grate cheese takes a long time and a lot of muscle , so much so that you are likely to start wondering how badly you really want the grated cheese . I tried the grater drum on reasonably fresh Parmesan and later tried the shredder drum on Jarlsberg . Neither drum worked satisfactorily . That may be because it is made in China where hard western - style cheese is nearly unknown . Yeah I know it says MIU France but the box clearly says "" Made in China "" .

It did n't kill the mixer , but the motor became very hot ! I will never use it again . I also have the roto slicer / shredder , fruit / veggie strainer , food grinder and sausage stuffer attachments ... none of these have even made my stand mixer very warm . --That tells me the pasta maker attachment is a bad product . I am thankful that my model is 525 watts ... I could only imagine what would have happened if I had a classic 300 watt model!My best advice is to pick up an inexpensive pasta machine or an Emperia hand crank pasta machine .

I wrote the company to complain and they said they would replace it if I mailed it in , but with the weight of the set ( because it really is a heavy - duty set of flatware ) it would have cost me a fortune to ship it to them and then all I would have gotten in return was another set of flatware that would probably look the same way in a short period of time .

54300,3,"Horrible tasting ice cream that costs more than premium I bought this item on sale at Shopko , where it will be returned today . I froze the gel disk as instructed , bought all the ingredients listed in the recipe booklet for vanilla ice cream , cooled the ingredients after mixing as instructed . After 45 minutes of mixing I ended up with ice cream soup . You could let this thing run forever and never end up with ice cream that is set up enough to eat . I put it in a container in the freezer . The next morning I had an ice cream brick . Not to be deterred I microwaved it for 15 seconds until it was soft enough to actually remove with my metal ice cream scoop . This stuff gets harder than cement ! After all this work the ice cream had a bad plastic - like aftertaste . I had to throw it all out . If this is n't enough to deter you keep in mind that the "" heavy cream "" called for in most of the recipes listed in the booklet costs a pretty hefty price . I paid $ 2.50 for the heavy cream listed to make 1.5 quarts of ice cream . That price does n't even include the other ingredients listed .

While removing an old sofa to make way for new furniture , the delivery men stained the new carpet . I whipped out our new Atlantis , filled the rinse tank and popped in the soap cartridge . With manual in hand , I tried to quickly clean the carpet as the new furniture was making its way up the stairs ... The unit did not dispense soapy water , the hand - held wand leaked , and finally I discovered that the body of the until was leaking all over my carpet , creating a soggy new stain .

54315,3,"Bad Unit Wish I had heeded the advice of most of the reviewers before I purchased this . I went ahead and purchased this because it was replacing a Braun coffee maker that we had had for 10 - 15 years . After it got the new plastic taste out of it , it made good coffee . Even without the Brita Filter . Just like all the reviewers indicated , the carafe leaked and spilled badly unless you poured very slowly and carefully . Unfortunately , it has quit working after only 2 1/2 months . The seller , Etronics , is declining to do anything about it saying it is now outside of their 30 return period . That will be the last thing I buy through them . Like uhh , since they sell Braun , one would think they would have some recourse through Braun and try to help their customers . So , here I am between the proverbial rock and a hard place , try to find a Braun warranty center and wait for it to get repaired or replaced , or just bite the bullet an go buy another . ( want to bet it wo n't be a Braun ? ) Additionally , what do we do for coffee in the mean time ? Such are the hazards of purchasing an electric appliance on the internet",234,0,0.22822989337450472,0.0940042710130551,0.0005000000000000362,0.05145116946500193,0.0005000000000000362,0.0005000000000000362,0.0005000000000000362,0.0005000000000000362,0.0005000000000000362,0.0005000000000000362,0.0005000000000000362,0.0005000000000000362,0.18148702501872113,0.0005000000000000362,0.0005000000000000362,0.0005000000000000362,0.07388204263708106,0.1153992871435993,0.025470093271566456,0.0005000000000000362,0.0005000000000000362,0.0005000000000000362,0.04832626774945811,0.0005000000000000362,0.0005000000000000362,0.0005000000000000362,0.0005000000000000362,0.0005000000000000362,0.0005000000000000362,0.0005000000000000362,0.0005000000000000362,0.0005000000000000362,0.0005000000000000362,0.0005000000000000362,0.0005000000000000362,0.0005000000000000362,0.0005000000000000362,0.0005000000000000362,0.0005000000000000362,0.0853060659313948,0.032079553204986566,0.0005000000000000362,0.04486433119062943,0.0005000000000000362,0.0005000000000000362,0.0005000000000000362,0.0005000000000000362,0.0005000000000000362,0.0005000000000000362,0.0005000000000000362,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
54332,3,"Reliability is the Issue Unfortunately , I 've ordered more than my share of FoodSaver products , having bought into the philosophy of vacuum storage , despite reading ample warnings from discontented consumers . What many of them claim is very much to the point : plastic containers frequently develop cracks and loss of vacuum . I 've had many of their marinators and storage canisters prove defective after less than 10 uses . It seems to be related to the material properties and container size characteristics . The smaller containers seem to last longer . Those with thick walls relative to the specified volume or reinforcing structures seem to last just a bit longer . In plain language , the plastic containers are unreliable . FoodSaver should develop materials and designs that can handle the stress of the vacuum cycling placed on them , or quit the the business . Since their products have been on the market for many years , I can only assume they are more interested in recruiting new customers than satisfying existing customers . If you like filling out warranty forms every few weeks , more power to you . Bottle sealers are equally worthless . Every one that I bought lost vacuum in short order . In one case , a defective seal resulted in a spill of cooking oil that damaged a nylon tent and other camping gear . FoodSaver has done a good job with certain items in their product line . The vacuum unit is well designed and performs reliably , as long as the instuctions are followed . The bagging system is unassailable , even though the cost of the bags and rolls is quite high ( read Consumer Reports reviews ) . And , to be fair , their Universal lids are excellent .

54348,3,Great Value BUT ! ! ! The 17 piece set is a great value but quality of the stainless steel is poor . The mirror finish does n't last long when you begin cooking on or even boiling water . The bond use to stick the bottom plate to the bottom of the pan is odd . When 1st heated it makes a few popping sounds . I did n't expect a great quailty product due to the cost of the set . Finding everything that I needed and used was more important . The set does heat evenly and cook well it 's just overall spotting and stains are an eye sore .

54350,3,"Pretty , but not very functional I like the Calphalon Contemporary line a great deal , and so I was pleased to find the steamer insert that fit my pan . But my first attempt to use it was a failure -- the small steamer holes ( and not very many of them ) are easily covered by the food to be steamed , leaving the insert to function like a double boiler . After working for close to an hour to steam summer squash ( which should take 20 minutes at most ) , I gave up and dumped the squash into the steaming water and boiled it . I 'm sure that some foods will steam in this pan , but items that lay flat like sliced vegetables will be a problem",134,0,0.32249657639447765,0.00086956521739136,0.00086956521739136,0.00086956521739136,0.1384295031186751,0.00086956521739136,0.00086956521739136,0.00086956521739136,0.00086956521739136,0.00086956521739136,0.00086956521739136,0.00086956521739136,0.00086956521739136,0.00086956521739136,0.00086956521739136,0.00086956521739136,0.00086956521739136,0.00086956521739136,0.0878260869565263,0.00086956521739136,0.00086956521739136,0.00086956521739136,0.00086956521739136,0.04519087683370577,0.044472279045197224,0.00086956521739136,0.00086956521739136,0.00086956521739136,0.00086956521739136,0.00086956521739136,0.00086956521739136,0.00086956521739136,0.00086956521739136,0.00086956521739136,0.00086956521739136,0.00086956521739136,0.00086956521739136,0.00086956521739136,0.00086956521739136,0.00086956521739136,0.00086956521739136,0.00086956521739136,0.059525745960911064,0.00086956521739136,0.00086956521739136,0.00086956521739136,0.26466762734267857,0.00086956521739136,0.00086956521739136,0.00086956521739136,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

The design is beautiful and the mixer is probably good for non - artisan breads , but should you have any problems with it , you 'll have to stay on the vendor to get any kind of response . I am still waiting for a refund on the product after 2 weeks . The last message I got was that "" it may take a bit longer . "" So be sure this is what you want before you buy it . Returning it is not easy . And getapc.com charges a $ 60 reshelving fee on top of the shipping you 'll have to pay to send it back . My markeplace experience has been very frustrating .

54451,3,"bad quality - a review after long term use I brought T - fal pans from my local Sam 's Club wearhouse , and initially , the pans worked great . this is my review after about 1.5 years of use:1 . the handle on the lid ( plastic ) broke after about a year . 2 . the non stick coating began to crack from regular use in about about 6 month , and it got so bad that i tossed the pan out in about a year and half . 3 . the handle broke twice on me and for both time i super glued them back on . on the third time , i just tossed them out and got an expensive Anolon titanium non - stick set . 4 . the pan is not made of aluminum and there are "" hot / cold "" spots on the pan . the hot / cold spot is caused by uneven distribution of heat . a good pan , generally with copper or aluminum core will evenly distribute heat . this pan does not . bottom line : do not use this pan in the oven eventhough the instruction said up to 400 degrees . the handle will and did crack on me for 3 times with occasional oven use.the pan is thin , and does not distribute heat well . and the worst : the non - stick coating is a joke . i found out that it 's actually cheaper to get a expensive set and use it for like 10 years instead of getting a cheap set for a third of the price and replace it every 2 years or less . not recommended .",290,0,0.059901743717026446,0.0002898550724637864,0.015236655842606998,0.04567380163843601,0.0002898550724637864,0.0002898550724637864,0.0002898550724637864,0.0002898550724637864,0.0002898550724637864,0.0002898550724637864,0.0002898550724637864,0.02034216179944509,0.0002898550724637864,0.0002898550724637864,0.014782608366773458,0.0002898550724637864,0.14403651440253218,0.0002898550724637864,0.0002898550724637864,0.0002898550724637864,0.0002898550724637864,0.0002898550724637864,0.0002898550724637864,0.032670827943276616,0.0002898550724637864,0.04677836042915822,0.0002898550724637864,0.0002898550724637864,0.0002898550724637864,0.0550843035531414,0.0002898550724637864,0.0002898550724637864,0.0002898550724637864,0.0002898550724637864,0.0002898550724637864,0.0002898550724637864,0.0002898550724637864,0.0002898550724637864,0.0002898550724637864,0.020691262171464976,0.08752291274944426,0.0002898550724637864,0.032365574128131874,0.0002898550724637864,0.1865619590455588,0.0002898550724637864,0.2279165316043075,0.0002898550724637864,0.0002898550724637864,0.0002898550724637864,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0

54510,3,"Pricey for an item that 's $ 19 , is n't it ? Recommended : No . The product is not very durableGood things : All in all , this caddy is great because it 's versatile . It 's huge and tall enough so a 12.5 "" round cake that 's about 5 inches high can fit in easily . The locking mechanism is also pretty neat . There 's 3 of them so it makes it very easy to carry without any fuss of the cake dropping on the floor . The handle of the carrier also gives a comfortable grip . Carrier is also see through so you 'll notice if the decorations have been messed up during the transporting process . NOT so Good things : NOT very durable . Locking mechanism that holds the base of the carrier may crack making it non portable . This product is susceptible to breakage perhaps because certain stores just have had these items on their shelf for a long time-- that 's only my assumption . Plastic should not crack unless it 's placed in extreme temperatures or is abused . Should the temperature in the fridge crack a plastic ?

When we bought our cabin I could n't stand to give one up and felt too cheap to buy another one ( they are pricey ) for carpet I 'm on five or six times a year so I bought this . At first I was thrilled . It was wonderful . After using it a few times however it has completely lost suction . Keep in mind this is being used in a second home with no kids , pets or real dirt . I would doubt that it 's on except that it 's noisy and takes off without me . I have bought new filters and looked for blockages but nothing has worked . Also the "" dirt container "" is sometimes hard to remove and put back . Feels like it 's catching on something . What a waste of money . Even in my college days I 've never had a worse vacuum .

54647,3,"works so so , company has exaggerated performance claims The Breville chiller works so so based on the 6 minute claim the company states . To get it cold like in your refrigerator it took more like 14 - 15 minutes -- still faster than a fridge though . Also , the description is sort of deceptive since it says new freezer gel packs , "" no messy ice "" . I thought you just use these freezer packs and that s it -- note you still need access to a freezer to freeze the gel packs before using . Also , you still need to add water and the freezer packs do n't really last that long . If you want to chill more than 1 bottle , I ended having to use good old ice cubes since the freezer packs were spent . Its a bit messy trying to chill anything other than wine bottles since a typical drink can / bottle will be submerged under the water bath and the only way to retrieve it is to dunk your hand in the cold water . Also , if you are chilling allot of beverages , there is no way to pour out the excess water as the ice melts -- they should put a drain spout at the bottom -- I had to unplug the unit and dump the excess water over the sink . It does work being faster than your fridge or freezer , but the companies performance claims are a bit exaggerated",258,0,0.3554205167753178,0.09045026448408408,0.051949536699813434,0.00046511627906979197,0.00046511627906979197,0.020377616430299353,0.00046511627906979197,0.00046511627906979197,0.00046511627906979197,0.00046511627906979197,0.00046511627906979197,0.00046511627906979197,0.00046511627906979197,0.00046511627906979197,0.00046511627906979197,0.00046511627906979197,0.0614324342331008,0.00046511627906979197,0.023720930232558418,0.00046511627906979197,0.00046511627906979197,0.00046511627906979197,0.05057730436525089,0.00046511627906979197,0.00046511627906979197,0.00046511627906979197,0.00046511627906979197,0.00046511627906979197,0.00046511627906979197,0.039463778293709395,0.00046511627906979197,0.00046511627906979197,0.00046511627906979197,0.00046511627906979197,0.00046511627906979197,0.00046511627906979197,0.00046511627906979197,0.00046511627906979197,0.00046511627906979197,0.00046511627906979197,0.00046511627906979197,0.00046511627906979197,0.12715297547626334,0.00046511627906979197,0.00046511627906979197,0.0997898349624153,0.061525273163465316,0.00046511627906979197,0.00046511627906979197,0.00046511627906979197,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0

54695,3,"Great Pasta takes practice . Bought the Machine , and got the correct flour . Made up the dough , and that was a success . Followed the instructions , used the vice to hold the machine to the table , then started off by cleaning the machine with a small piece of dough to get rid of machine oil . All that worked well . Then I started to make pasta . Making the sheets was fine , but as soon as I cut them into noodles it all went wrong . They started to stick together . My wife and I ended up having to work together , flouring the noodles as they came out of the machine to stop them sticking . But the pasta was delicious . I guess it just takes a bit of practice . In future I will leave the dough longer in the fridge to "" rest "" before rolling it , and have a mini - production line ready to catch and flour the cut noodles . The machine works great , I have no problems with it . It is cheap , it may fall apart , but for this price who really cares?I ca n't wait to try making my own pasta tricolore .

Also the ' dribble - proof ' design means that the mug has a very deep lip , and even when it is full you have to tip it far up and into your field of view to get the liquid flowing",142,0,0.0008695652173913848,0.0008695652173913848,0.0008695652173913848,0.0008695652173913848,0.0008695652173913848,0.0008695652173913848,0.0008695652173913848,0.06704942368975221,0.17878723677962963,0.0008695652173913848,0.0008695652173913848,0.0008695652173913848,0.0008695652173913848,0.0008695652173913848,0.0008695652173913848,0.0008695652173913848,0.18992931916494954,0.0008695652173913848,0.0008695652173913848,0.10046667164705157,0.0008695652173913848,0.0008695652173913848,0.0008695652173913848,0.044761955932316425,0.04476804820966685,0.04448372244325412,0.04618596711295175,0.0008695652173913848,0.0008695652173913848,0.0008695652173913848,0.0008695652173913848,0.0008695652173913848,0.13460363722140686,0.0008695652173913848,0.0008695652173913848,0.0008695652173913848,0.0008695652173913848,0.0008695652173913848,0.0008695652173913848,0.0008695652173913848,0.0008695652173913848,0.0008695652173913848,0.0008695652173913848,0.0008695652173913848,0.0008695652173913848,0.0008695652173913848,0.11418140910336574,0.0008695652173913848,0.0008695652173913848,0.0008695652173913848,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1

54711,3,"Incredibly Annoying ! ! ! I have never written an online review for a product before , but I am so annoyed by this dumb sifter that I just had to . I am not a "" speed "" baker of any sort , but I have four kids and do like to make birthday cakes , muffins , cookies , etc . My old sifter was so old it was getting flecks of rust into the flour , so I started looking for a new one . I chose this one after reading all the online reviews , and even though I saw that a few people found it slow , I was not prepared for how slow it really is ! I just sifted 3 + cups of confectioner 's sugar for cake frosting and it took over five minutes . As another reviewer said , in order to make it go faster I shook more vigorously and then had to keep changing hands because they got tired . ( I have never ever been tired out from BAKING before , fer ' pete 's sake ! ! ! ) I 'm not convinced that the people who designed this product have ever actually USED a sifter . I 'm stuck with the thing now , I suppose , so I 'll learn to just go slower . But it is literally about one tenth the speed of my old sifter - which was just your typical grocery store thing with a crank on one side . The one thing I really like is the caps for both ends - an innovation I 'm surprised nobody else has come up with . But that does n't redeem the product for me . In fact , if I can put my hands on another one of those old - fashioned ones ( at a thrift store , maybe ) I 'll snap it up and put this new one in the Goodwill bin .",335,0,0.04034603056751893,0.08149008289129775,0.0003703703703704078,0.0003703703703704078,0.0003703703703704078,0.040603101298213796,0.0003703703703704078,0.0003703703703704078,0.0003703703703704078,0.0003703703703704078,0.060394135670325616,0.0003703703703704078,0.4287419285453792,0.0003703703703704078,0.0003703703703704078,0.0003703703703704078,0.0003703703703704078,0.0003703703703704078,0.01888888888888983,0.0003703703703704078,0.0003703703703704078,0.0003703703703704078,0.0003703703703704078,0.08039279048719429,0.0003703703703704078,0.0003703703703704078,0.0003703703703704078,0.0003703703703704078,0.0003703703703704078,0.0003703703703704078,0.0003703703703704078,0.0003703703703704078,0.0003703703703704078,0.0003703703703704078,0.0003703703703704078,0.0003703703703704078,0.05622713395620988,0.0003703703703704078,0.0003703703703704078,0.08326630142049667,0.0003703703703704078,0.0003703703703704078,0.0003703703703704078,0.0003703703703704078,0.09483479145965779,0.0003703703703704078,0.0003703703703704078,0.0003703703703704078,0.0003703703703704078,0.0003703703703704078,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

54745,3,"broke after 5 uses This blender is very weak . It has a small blade that can not pull down anything of substance and I had to stir even soft fruit in liquid or it would never get cut up -- just the bottom part of the mix spins around . I used this blender four times since August 2006 ( when I bought it ) to make ' smoothies ' , always with poor results . As the other reviewer said , the fruit stays lumpy . The little blades are n't strong enough . Yesterday I wanted to liquify some cooked potatoes for soup . Of course they are thick and starchy , but after the usual ' stirring ' to get them to move through the blender , the speed buttons started to vibrate and I could smell the unit getting hot . I was n't overworking it -- mainly pulsing and then running it for about 30 seconds . All of a sudden , it would n't work any more . It just burned out . If you actually cook and expect a blender to blend things , do n't buy this blender . I 'm going to see if Amazon will take it back . ( Note : after I wrote this , I was told by Amazon that I had to get in touch with the manufacturer , which I could do because it was within 90 days of purchase . However , the company wants me to mail in the plug and $ 5 for ' shipping ' to get a replacement , which obviously I do n't want . Why would I want to pay $ 5 more for a product that did n't work the first time ? Why would I want the product again at all ? Amazon would have taken it back , but they wanted it returned in the box , which I threw out . I 'm even more dissatisfied with this product now than when I wrote this review originally . Maybe I can make it into an interesting planter and sell it at a craft fair . . .",364,0,0.00037735849056607366,0.00037735849056607366,0.0362045575043545,0.00037735849056607366,0.00037735849056607366,0.00037735849056607366,0.00037735849056607366,0.00037735849056607366,0.00037735849056607366,0.00037735849056607366,0.0661295837738531,0.00037735849056607366,0.09131815702874668,0.00037735849056607366,0.01924528301886694,0.00037735849056607366,0.00037735849056607366,0.19738103647045602,0.019120771885654194,0.00037735849056607366,0.00037735849056607366,0.00037735849056607366,0.030308276341413136,0.00037735849056607366,0.022790605202460176,0.00037735849056607366,0.00037735849056607366,0.00037735849056607366,0.00037735849056607366,0.00037735849056607366,0.00037735849056607366,0.00037735849056607366,0.00037735849056607366,0.00037735849056607366,0.00037735849056607366,0.00037735849056607366,0.00037735849056607366,0.00037735849056607366,0.10125010834610296,0.00037735849056607366,0.00037735849056607366,0.00037735849056607366,0.029364873574592745,0.00037735849056607366,0.21425615245976196,0.15829097175222687,0.00037735849056607366,0.00037735849056607366,0.00037735849056607366,0.00037735849056607366,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0

54768,3,"Good while it lasts I have purchased this item twice . The first barely made it through a grill season and the second proved even less hearty .

54792,3,"Broke Three In Quick Succession I bought three of these when I saw them in a local store , thinking them a great deal . They LOOK like the equivalent of the Henckels , solid and sturdy , at one - fifth the price . Looks can be deceiving . They are suitable for paper , skin , aluminum foil , etc . , but do not try them on anything more substantial , like chicken leg bones . I broke these on items that I routinely cut through with my Henckels and Wusthof shears . The cost of sending them back under warranty was about the purchase cost , so I tossed out all three pairs . Sorry , Chicago Cutlery , but if you are selling office scissors , label them that way . I expect kitchen shears to be a LOT tougher , so I ca n't mark these more than one star . Chicago Cutlery makes a pair of scissors called the Insignia series , for only about $ 2 - 3 more .

( I believe this one was a gift to me ) Do yourselfs a favor and spend the extra cash on a metal version or even glass if this exists , obviously the motor does n't last long and the plastic parts break to fast according to other reviews I 've read .",226,0,0.0004255319148936603,0.033817762392438035,0.0004255319148936603,0.02304331901228933,0.1482426226817783,0.02313800436565542,0.0004255319148936603,0.0004255319148936603,0.02319569947890344,0.0004255319148936603,0.0004255319148936603,0.0004255319148936603,0.19247178586708547,0.0004255319148936603,0.021702127659574487,0.0004255319148936603,0.0004255319148936603,0.03164731759299006,0.02170212765957483,0.0004255319148936603,0.0004255319148936603,0.0004255319148936603,0.02630237816011594,0.0004255319148936603,0.0004255319148936603,0.0004255319148936603,0.0004255319148936603,0.0004255319148936603,0.0004255319148936603,0.0004255319148936603,0.0004255319148936603,0.0004255319148936603,0.0004255319148936603,0.0004255319148936603,0.0004255319148936603,0.0004255319148936603,0.0004255319148936603,0.0004255319148936603,0.0004255319148936603,0.16912075142370916,0.11460598262057184,0.0004255319148936603,0.021707722221079754,0.0004255319148936603,0.07983710105756249,0.0004255319148936603,0.054571680785393234,0.0004255319148936603,0.0004255319148936603,0.0004255319148936603,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0

54832,3,NOT HAPPY I would have to say that amazon gave me a good deal and immediate delivery . Unfortunatly i had to return this item . I have nt been satisfied because the heating element heats up on the top rather than where it has to heat up . After ironing I could still see a lot of creases . They do nt mention about the base being a wood plank either . I have used a Simplicity machine earlier and hence i know the quality of steam press but this machine is a waste of time and money . I would rather buy a normal iron to this or pay extra and buy a better one .

54836,3,"Beautiful item but not functional I researched a lot before buying this slow cooker . I have a Nesco roaster that I love and use often . I needed a large slow cooker . I started researching . Started out with the all clad but everyone said it got really hot . I wanted a good one . The Cuisinart had good ratings elsewhere and I thought well even it cooks faster that is fine . I will just watch it until I get used to it and go from there . Every dish I have watched .. they all cooked in LESS than half the allotted time . Today I made a crock pot mac and cheese casserole and it burned within ONE HOUR . Way too hot . I called Cuisinart several times and they said I may have a defective unit . Well I doubt it . I just think it runs hot . I really was dismayed because I love the size and the design of this cooker . Really was not up to par with Cuisinart products that I know and love . Let me also say that I am a good cook . I feel that I know my way around any appliance . I was not happy that I was not going to be able to leave this cooker all day but I was ok to give it a try . It is not at all what I expected . I read the other reviews here and wish I would have taken heed of them . I had read good reviews elsewhere and saw two articles in magazines on this cooker being the best . If you are going to spend 100 bucks on a slow cooker , stop , get one of the higher end rival ones with a timer and then get a nesco roaster . You can cook anything all summer without heating up your kitchen .",327,0,0.00026666666666670305,0.03550962566287674,0.00026666666666670305,0.00026666666666670305,0.00026666666666670305,0.00026666666666670305,0.00026666666666670305,0.00026666666666670305,0.023384416987377397,0.00026666666666670305,0.00026666666666670305,0.014428675202613987,0.23288879741055063,0.00026666666666670305,0.02693310413798626,0.00026666666666670305,0.00026666666666670305,0.00026666666666670305,0.013600000000000254,0.022507789844909424,0.00026666666666670305,0.1598404328464591,0.03386855864597766,0.00026666666666670305,0.015830976291450766,0.0515296664454882,0.00026666666666670305,0.00026666666666670305,0.00026666666666670305,0.00026666666666670305,0.00026666666666670305,0.00026666666666670305,0.00026666666666670305,0.00026666666666670305,0.00026666666666670305,0.00026666666666670305,0.00026666666666670305,0.00026666666666670305,0.07389374144290035,0.023119649209496638,0.00026666666666670305,0.00026666666666670305,0.07985772167197383,0.00026666666666670305,0.18347351086660443,0.00026666666666670305,0.00026666666666670305,0.00026666666666670305,0.00026666666666670305,0.00026666666666670305,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

But when I tried to email customer service it was to complicated to let them know . I also read there warranty and it appears your grills should be covered under one year . But of course it adds at there discretion . I am still deciding which to get but cuisinart has a 3 year warranty,83,0,0.0013333333333334127,0.0013333333333334127,0.06694238574646438,0.0013333333333334127,0.0013333333333334127,0.0680000000000016,0.0013333333333334127,0.0013333333333334127,0.0013333333333334127,0.0013333333333334127,0.0013333333333334127,0.0013333333333334127,0.43616299422730814,0.0013333333333334127,0.06800000000000148,0.0013333333333334127,0.0013333333333334127,0.09210994565908559,0.0013333333333334127,0.0013333333333334127,0.0013333333333334127,0.0013333333333334127,0.0013333333333334127,0.08626033327974236,0.0013333333333334127,0.0013333333333334127,0.0013333333333334127,0.0013333333333334127,0.0013333333333334127,0.0013333333333334127,0.0013333333333334127,0.0013333333333334127,0.0013333333333334127,0.0013333333333334127,0.0013333333333334127,0.0013333333333334127,0.0013333333333334127,0.0013333333333334127,0.0013333333333334127,0.0013333333333334127,0.0013333333333334127,0.0013333333333334127,0.0013333333333334127,0.0013333333333334127,0.1251910077540598,0.0013333333333334127,0.0013333333333334127,0.0013333333333334127,0.0013333333333334127,0.0013333333333334127,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
54860,3,"Why should anyone want a waffle baker that works ? The waffle baker ( formerly waffle iron ) works great . Make that ' worked great . ' For an entire month , then it died .

The latest is the honchos see no reason to hurry ( ! ) our replacement . Customer service is hoping -- not guaranteeing , not promising , but hoping -- we will get our replacement in mid - January . If , and it is a very big ' if ' , we get our replacement in January , that will make the score 5 to 1 against us . For six months they will have had our money , and for one month of the six we will have had a functioning waffle baker . It would seem that it is difficult to do much worse than buy a waffle baker that dies after a month with no replacement on the horizon .

54893,3,"Quality of This Product Does Not Match Cuisinart 's Reputation Cuisinart is one manufacturer that has capitalized on its brand name and produced this inferior product . My criticisms of this machine : 1 . Its heavy and relatively large . It is awkward to place in and remove from a cabinet , and so it remains on the counter top where it takes up precious real estate with its large footprint . 2 . It 's slow . With its weight , you would think the grinder would have a powerful motor that would quickly grind coffee . It does not . It takes a very long time to grind the coffee.3 . The grind is uneven and actually clumps . The grind is fine at the bottom and course and clumpy at the top . The finely ground coffee sticks to the bottom of the bowl below the blade . I must use a finger to remove the ground coffee or pound the bowel against the palm of my other hand . Pulsing makes no difference . Grinding a full bowl improves the performance somewhat . Yet , grinding beans for up to minute still does not produce a grind fine enough for even a cone filter . Espresso is out of the question . 4 . I invariably spill ground coffee on the counter top no matter how carefully I remove the lid . Although the grinder looks cool with its stainless steel finish and it has a larger bowl than most blade grinders , those two alone do not even come close to overcoming its other deficiencies . Surely there must be better blade coffee grinders on the market",283,0,0.4205120028873321,0.2516525548839958,0.046588919915163146,0.00048780487804881865,0.026722014290355655,0.00048780487804881865,0.027276087333277965,0.00048780487804881865,0.00048780487804881865,0.00048780487804881865,0.07065901684474749,0.00048780487804881865,0.00048780487804881865,0.00048780487804881865,0.00048780487804881865,0.00048780487804881865,0.00048780487804881865,0.00048780487804881865,0.00048780487804881865,0.00048780487804881865,0.00048780487804881865,0.030304044715845545,0.00048780487804881865,0.00048780487804881865,0.00048780487804881865,0.00048780487804881865,0.00048780487804881865,0.00048780487804881865,0.02830215332980752,0.00048780487804881865,0.00048780487804881865,0.00048780487804881865,0.00048780487804881865,0.00048780487804881865,0.00048780487804881865,0.00048780487804881865,0.00048780487804881865,0.00048780487804881865,0.0779832057994733,0.00048780487804881865,0.00048780487804881865,0.00048780487804881865,0.00048780487804881865,0.00048780487804881865,0.00048780487804881865,0.00048780487804881865,0.00048780487804881865,0.00048780487804881865,0.00048780487804881865,0.00048780487804881865,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The first problem is with the size of the muffin cups -- they are significantly more shallow than in a typical mini - muffin pan . 2 . The silicone warped from the heat while in the oven , spilling the meager contents of the tiny cups over the edges , making flat , crooked , ugly muffins.3 . The silicone did not release the muffins easily . I did spray it with nonstick spray before filling , and allowed the muffins to cool completely before I tried to get them out . I did n't even bother to try and wash it , so I do n't have any comment about the ease of washing . I wo n't be wasting any more time and ingredients in it , so I threw it away .

54917,3,"poor color transfer on cups I expected the dishes to be more substantial . The plates are very light and thin , more like melamine in feel . The colors on the dinner plates and bowls are like in the pictures seen on the internet so they are what I expected . Very disappointed with the cups- I bought two sets , and only 1 of the 8 cups had ALMOST the same color intensity as the dinner plates - the others were so faded ( kinda like when your color cartridge in your computer is outta ink ) they looked like , either rejects , or they had gone through a heavy load dishwash 100 time",117,0,0.001000000000000056,0.134151048582471,0.05118175535035733,0.001000000000000056,0.001000000000000056,0.001000000000000056,0.05149622948866312,0.001000000000000056,0.22628564199902032,0.001000000000000056,0.001000000000000056,0.001000000000000056,0.001000000000000056,0.001000000000000056,0.001000000000000056,0.001000000000000056,0.001000000000000056,0.25421104088850643,0.001000000000000056,0.001000000000000056,0.001000000000000056,0.001000000000000056,0.001000000000000056,0.001000000000000056,0.001000000000000056,0.001000000000000056,0.001000000000000056,0.001000000000000056,0.001000000000000056,0.23867428369097954,0.001000000000000056,0.001000000000000056,0.001000000000000056,0.001000000000000056,0.001000000000000056,0.001000000000000056,0.001000000000000056,0.001000000000000056,0.001000000000000056,0.001000000000000056,0.001000000000000056,0.001000000000000056,0.001000000000000056,0.001000000000000056,0.001000000000000056,0.001000000000000056,0.001000000000000056,0.001000000000000056,0.001000000000000056,0.001000000000000056,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1

54949,3,"I 'm so disappointed For fifteen years I 've talked about getting a good stand mixer and my sweet husband went out and bought me this one . He bought it on sale at Cosco last Spring , then stored it until we moved back to the States from Europe and gave it to me as a housewarming gift in Nov. I 've used it a few times but the paddle and whisk do n't reach the bottom of the bowl and the screw meant for adjustment will NOT tighten any further . I ca n't get into the bowl at all while it is in the upward position ... to scape or to add ingredients . I like to make crepes , which calls for adding sifted flour gradually over eggs while beating . It 's impossible with this machine . I get a gluey mass at the bottom of the bowl , unmixed ... and the batter is full of lumps . If I want to scape the bowl , ( which is frequently necessary since the paddle or whisk does n't reach all the way to the sides of the bowl ) I have to stop the machine and lower the bowl each time , and even then , with the paddle or whisk attached , it 's not easy to reach the sides of the bowl towards the back . You ca n't turn the bowl without removing it from the stand completely . You have to yank on the bowl and lift at the same time to remove it from the stand . This takes a fair amount of force to maneuver . It 's impossible to remove the paddle or whisk without first letting it drop completely into the batter . The speeds are not variable enough .

54995,3,"Scary to open I bought this set of knives 2 years ago . I have not experienced the rust or pock marks that other reviewers have , and I have been pleased with the way my knives have stayed sharp even with a LOT of use . The purpose for my buying this set was because of the locking feature . I have little children at home and wanted to make the knives inaccessable to them . Unfortunately the locking mechanism is a little too hard to open for me . Mine gets stuck on lock and then I ca n't get it open without pulling on it with great force . And when you are pulling on something full of sharp knives , that is a little uncomfortable to say the least . I have worried more than once that the force I have had to use to open it would cause the knives to all fly out when it came free . They never have , but it is unnerving . I tried to contact Cuisinart about it , to no avail . No complaints on the knives , and I love that there are extra slots in the block for expanding the set , which I have . But do n't buy the product strictly for the locking feature , it is not worth it",228,0,0.0005263157894737201,0.0005263157894737201,0.0005263157894737201,0.0005263157894737201,0.0005263157894737201,0.0005263157894737201,0.0005263157894737201,0.0005263157894737201,0.0005263157894737201,0.0005263157894737201,0.04234421871112694,0.0005263157894737201,0.09201238792257184,0.0005263157894737201,0.031019644242111014,0.0005263157894737201,0.0005263157894737201,0.07456039166212738,0.0005263157894737201,0.0005263157894737201,0.0005263157894737201,0.0005263157894737201,0.0005263157894737201,0.0005263157894737201,0.05335255150916453,0.2559200549762616,0.0005263157894737201,0.0005263157894737201,0.0005263157894737201,0.0005263157894737201,0.0005263157894737201,0.0005263157894737201,0.05459009293797542,0.0005263157894737201,0.11536106597633887,0.0005263157894737201,0.0005263157894737201,0.0005263157894737201,0.0005263157894737201,0.13478539083105318,0.06464992621510103,0.0005263157894737201,0.0005263157894737201,0.0005263157894737201,0.0005263157894737201,0.0005263157894737201,0.06087795922669297,0.0005263157894737201,0.0005263157894737201,0.0005263157894737201,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

55010,3,"Excellent Product and Transaction The KitchenAid KFPW760 is exactly as advertised . It has three nested work bowls . The inner , smallest one takes a special blade ( a smaller version of the standard processor blade ) . It 's perfect for pulverizing / mixing small quantities of things . Pulling the used bowl out leaves the next one ready for use without having to stop and clean something . The same is true for the next one until you reach the largest , 12 cup bowl . A number of blades come in a well designed transparent and strong storage box ( finally , a way to keep everything together ) . The unit even has with a fruit juicer accessory that replaces the bowl . It 's the kind with the rotating hub ( two hub sizes are included , one for lemons and a larger one for oranges , etc ) . While it seems to work , it 's not as convenient as a low cost dedicated version such as the Black and Decker , but what the heck , it 's worth trying . The motor is quiet and you get a real feeling of professionalism when using it . At first I was disappointed that there were n't any fancy front panel switch options , but after thinking about it , you only need the provided On , Off and Pulse . Would I buy it again ? Absolutely . Would I buy it again from Amazon ? Again , absolutely .

55019,3,"Excellent kid 's game As a mathematician , game theorist , and proud Chi Omicron Chi ( XOX , aka "" Xocks "" ) brother , I have always been interested in this the simplest of m , n , k games , i.e. games in which players alternate placing markers on an m x n board with each player trying to place k of his or her markers in a row . As every game theorist knows , perfect tic - tac - toe play by both players results in a tie game every time , with neither player achieving victory . The clever child will figure this out on her own , as I did at an early age , and I lost interest in playing tic - tac - toe before I turned five . I never lost interest , however , in studying tic - tac - toe and similar games , which began my pursuit of mathematics and game theory , and partly accounts for my joining Chi Omicron Chi as a college freshman . As part of our initiation , pledges had to play a modified form of tic - tac - toe with vodka - filled shot glasses for markers . Each player had five glasses , and as he placed his marker , he would empty his glass . The loser would drink the remaining shot glasses . Most of us knew how to play perfect games of tic - tac - toe , so really the point of the game , as with most fraternity games , was to see who could best hold his liquor . I do remember one unfortunate pledge , Bob , who never figured out how to play perfect tic - tac - toe and nearly drank himself into catatonia . All these thoughts came rushing , so to speak , back to me when I saw the "" Shot Glasses Tic - Tac - Toe "" available for so reasonable a price at about a dollar per component . I have a four - year - old son who has yet to perfect his tic - tac - toe game , so I bought this set to educate him . We play the same way I did in the Xocks fraternity house . Of course I do n't give him pure vodka in his shot glasses ; he only weighs 35 lbs . As 35 lbs represents approximately a fifth of my own weight , I dilute his vodka in a 1-to-4 dilution with orange juice . I know what you 're thinking : what happens when he loses and must finish off the remaining shot glasses , including mine ? I am nothing if not fair , so when he loses , I give him an equivalent amount of diluted vodka to however much pure vodka I have remaining in my shot glasses . Since I , knowing how to play perfect tic - tac - toe , never lose to my son , the reverse problem , my having to drink his remaining shots , never occurs . My son loses more often than not , and he usually ends up walking into walls , falling down , and later becoming violently sick . You would think all this negative reinforcement would promote rapid and forceful mastery of tic - tac - toe , but his cognitive development must be lacking . I can only surmise that the time delay between his losing tic - tac - toe games and the negative effects of alcohol poisoning inhibits his forming the negatively reinforcing connections . He still loves to play , however , but his game , if anything , seems to be getting worse , almost as if he is trying to lose",640,1,0.000266666666666702,0.000266666666666702,0.000266666666666702,0.000266666666666702,0.000266666666666702,0.000266666666666702,0.014440286892326805,0.000266666666666702,0.18086135195022648,0.000266666666666702,0.000266666666666702,0.000266666666666702,0.11838296988582553,0.000266666666666702,0.000266666666666702,0.000266666666666702,0.000266666666666702,0.020285563117224965,0.000266666666666702,0.017926206717338113,0.000266666666666702,0.000266666666666702,0.000266666666666702,0.000266666666666702,0.000266666666666702,0.010299998411481718,0.016344649552269046,0.000266666666666702,0.000266666666666702,0.000266666666666702,0.000266666666666702,0.000266666666666702,0.04263391537241732,0.000266666666666702,0.000266666666666702,0.000266666666666702,0.000266666666666702,0.000266666666666702,0.000266666666666702,0.0497503202249999,0.10576919669788644,0.0580177367433343,0.000266666666666702,0.20373273222077615,0.000266666666666702,0.000266666666666702,0.1516884055472253,0.000266666666666702,0.000266666666666702,0.000266666666666702,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0

55049,3,"Skip cheap imitators with fancy gadgets When we got married 7 years ago , we were given a hand mixer of another brand ( Sunbeam , I think ) that had seven ( or was it nine ? ) speeds and lots of different attachments ( dough hook , wisk , etc . , none of wich worked well ) . I have a hard time remembering exact spefications because it died after 6 months , and I had n't even mixed anything heavy with it ! I always mixed most of my flour into things by hand to try to spare the motor ( my mom had burnt through several mixers).So we went to the store , and for $ 30 we could get another cheap brand with many speeds and fancy gadgets ( several brands and models available ) , or we could get this Kitchenaid with one set of beaters and three speeds . I chose this simple Kitchaid and have never been sorry . This little hand mixer takes it all -- even stiff cookie dough like roll - out sugar cookies . And it mixes every last bit of the flour in . Beaters do n't clog , dough mixes up smooth . I plan on someday getting a bigger kitchenaid , but so far have n't needed it .

55058,3,"Excellent for Large Portions I did not find a problem with the balance , as previously mentioned by another reviewer . The only thing a potential buyer needs to be aware of is , that if they are planning on tossing their food , they had better be strong because this unit is heavy ! Other than that , it proves to be very useful for large portions . It heats quickly , heats evenly , holds the heat and leaves plenty of room to stir . Yes , it does heat evenly and allows the heat to drift up the sides . The purpose of a stirfry pan is to allow heat to move the sides of the pan to allow food touching the sides of the pan to cook as well . Now keep in mind , there is nt a perfect stirfry pan out on the market if you are cooking on a traditional gas top , flat top or coil range .

55062,3,"Some Le Creuset Products need "" Seasoning . "" Le Creuset 's grills , woks , and frying pans come with a textured black enamel that needs to be "" Seasoned "" like tradiitonal cast iron . There are instructions in the product pamphlet as to how to do this . Basically after removing the stickers using a warm water and soap soak and drying the pan , the pan is coated with a thin layer of vegetable oil with a paper towel and heated at medium heat until the oil smokes . Let the pan cool , remove the oil with a paper towel , and repeat two or three times . A surface "" patina "" builds up that is quite non - stick . From now on the pan can be cleaned with a moist towel . In the case of burned - on food , a brief soak in soapy water works well . As the pan is used the patina continues to build . Le Creuset 's omelete pans do come with silverstone non - stick if you like non - stick . The textured enamel works well and is stable at higher heats than non - stick coating . I own a Le Creuset Wok , a square grill pan , and three frying pans with this textured finish and I find that they work fine after being seasoned this way . I also own a Le Creuset Omlete pan that has a good non - stick coating . This pan work fine for delicate foods like egg and pancake preparations . The textured finish pans work well for grilling meats , stir fries , and other hardier preparations . If you use good non - scratch silicone or nylon tools in your Le Creuset wares and a small amout of PAM or a little oil spread with a paper towel you will have no problems .",323,1,0.07042400309375035,0.10033056232001253,0.0003571428571428795,0.0003571428571428795,0.0003571428571428795,0.0003571428571428795,0.018214408000298644,0.0003571428571428795,0.0003571428571428795,0.0003571428571428795,0.05432861055284069,0.0003571428571428795,0.0003571428571428795,0.0003571428571428795,0.0003571428571428795,0.0003571428571428795,0.0003571428571428795,0.0003571428571428795,0.0003571428571428795,0.0003571428571428795,0.0003571428571428795,0.0003571428571428795,0.0003571428571428795,0.0003571428571428795,0.0003571428571428795,0.0003571428571428795,0.020961392907041288,0.0003571428571428795,0.0003571428571428795,0.07553355004425831,0.0003571428571428795,0.0003571428571428795,0.0003571428571428795,0.0003571428571428795,0.0003571428571428795,0.018244032523199172,0.0003571428571428795,0.0003571428571428795,0.09441292921688116,0.0003571428571428795,0.0003571428571428795,0.0003571428571428795,0.0461413835942448,0.0003571428571428795,0.256398953030907,0.026145229141085625,0.20529351700405105,0.0003571428571428795,0.0003571428571428795,0.0003571428571428795,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0
55064,3,Sharp blade disc storage I am glad that I finally have a storage unit to hold my sharp Cuisinart Blades . I have three little kids and the thought of them getting their little hands on them always had me worried . The only design flaw is that it can be difficult to open and then lock back into place . I knew this going into my purchase and decided to take the chance as the flaw was better then not having to worry about my children . Hopefully Cuisinart is aware of the design flaw and working to fix it,101,1,0.0009523809523810346,0.18869732893420915,0.0009523809523810346,0.0009523809523810346,0.0009523809523810346,0.05350298606617193,0.0009523809523810346,0.0009523809523810346,0.10468686950498238,0.0009523809523810346,0.0009523809523810346,0.0009523809523810346,0.0009523809523810346,0.0009523809523810346,0.0009523809523810346,0.0009523809523810346,0.0009523809523810346,0.0009523809523810346,0.0009523809523810346,0.0009523809523810346,0.0009523809523810346,0.0009523809523810346,0.10153888534562706,0.0009523809523810346,0.0009523809523810346,0.08997729153888158,0.0009523809523810346,0.0009523809523810346,0.0009523809523810346,0.0009523809523810346,0.0009523809523810346,0.0009523809523810346,0.0009523809523810346,0.0009523809523810346,0.09516159463314418,0.0009523809523810346,0.0009523809523810346,0.0009523809523810346,0.0009523809523810346,0.0009523809523810346,0.0009523809523810346,0.0009523809523810346,0.0009523809523810346,0.0009523809523810346,0.16233935078427475,0.1640956931927055,0.0009523809523810346,0.0009523809523810346,0.0009523809523810346,0.0009523809523810346,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,1

55079,3,"All - Clad 16-Quart Stainless Stockpot Ok , this is obviously not the same as the traditional All Clad stockpots , if it was it would be more then triple the price of this one . It is part of the disk bottom collection , however it is still top quality stainless steel and very well made . I certainly would not consider it secondary . It is a little lighter in weight than the traditional All Clad but it is not a light weight pot by any means . It is great for sauce , soup , stew , etc . You will love it and you ca n't beat the price . It is very easy to clean . A+ Keep an eye out , there is always some kind of rebate or gift with most cooking purchases both on Amazon and in department and cooking stores . I actually got this stock pot free when I purchased my All - Clad Roti Pan set which also came with a rack and turkey lifters in Filene 's . I would have bought it anyway , it is an excellent stockpot and the price ca n't be beat . Tip : If you should get something stuck to the stainless steel use a product called "" Bar Keepers Friend "" to clean it . Most supermarkets have it and Kitchen Etc . and Bed , Bath and Beyond carry it too . The container ( like a Comet can ) is gold with blue and white writing . All Clad recommends it for cleaning stainless steel and it works like a dream and is very inexpensive .",278,1,0.12428609482195649,0.11964329625700136,0.02287628158883155,0.0004878048780488368,0.08436716059153518,0.0004878048780488368,0.0004878048780488368,0.0004878048780488368,0.02753101351153128,0.0004878048780488368,0.039422264381590855,0.0004878048780488368,0.0004878048780488368,0.0004878048780488368,0.0004878048780488368,0.0004878048780488368,0.0004878048780488368,0.19518921286077295,0.0004878048780488368,0.027024361563918502,0.0004878048780488368,0.0004878048780488368,0.0004878048780488368,0.0004878048780488368,0.02552464624977268,0.059851739624264134,0.0004878048780488368,0.0004878048780488368,0.0004878048780488368,0.0004878048780488368,0.0004878048780488368,0.0004878048780488368,0.0004878048780488368,0.0004878048780488368,0.0004878048780488368,0.04983783520529251,0.02769317218582592,0.0004878048780488368,0.05076174181085375,0.04392505691065261,0.0004878048780488368,0.0004878048780488368,0.0004878048780488368,0.0004878048780488368,0.0004878048780488368,0.0004878048780488368,0.08499295170449096,0.0004878048780488368,0.0004878048780488368,0.0004878048780488368,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

55134,3,"highly functional , a couple of drawbacks . First , the good stuff : this peeler is sharp , requires little effort in peeling away even the toughest skins and seems quite durable . I like having it , but I 'm also holding on to my cheap little Oxo peeler for a couple of reasons : first , the Rosle produces very thick peels , which is a bit wasteful . Second , I tend to be a switch hitter in terms of peeling direction and really like having a peeler that can either peel toward me or away from me . The Rosle peels in only one direction and thus sells both a right - handed and left - handed peeler . That said , I do appreciate its sold stainless steel construction , which will resist rust for many more years than lesser models",147,1,0.4338768474007147,0.0008695652173913656,0.0008695652173913656,0.0008695652173913656,0.0008695652173913656,0.0008695652173913656,0.0008695652173913656,0.0008695652173913656,0.0008695652173913656,0.0008695652173913656,0.0008695652173913656,0.0443478260869577,0.0008695652173913656,0.0008695652173913656,0.0008695652173913656,0.0008695652173913656,0.09270342914720281,0.0008695652173913656,0.0008695652173913656,0.0008695652173913656,0.0008695652173913656,0.0008695652173913656,0.0008695652173913656,0.0008695652173913656,0.0008695652173913656,0.0008695652173913656,0.0008695652173913656,0.0008695652173913656,0.0008695652173913656,0.0008695652173913656,0.0008695652173913656,0.0008695652173913656,0.1166836514700019,0.0008695652173913656,0.0008695652173913656,0.0008695652173913656,0.0008695652173913656,0.0008695652173913656,0.0008695652173913656,0.0008695652173913656,0.06758952329496785,0.0008695652173913656,0.0008695652173913656,0.0008695652173913656,0.12350706105727055,0.0839003571950556,0.0008695652173913656,0.0008695652173913656,0.0008695652173913656,0.0008695652173913656,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,1

55144,3,"Very Pleased So far I have made several different ice creams in my new machine . This is the first I 'd ever had and the hard part is making the different recipies and deciding what you like and what you do n't . The machine is very efficient . You just put the mixture in and it does all the work . You may want to check on your mixture a few times because some thicken earlier than others . You just stop it and give a taste to see if you like the consistency . I made one mistake of putting the mixture in before it was completely cooled and it did n't thicken and I wasted all of it , so be sure it is completely cool before you put it in the machine . The machine is a little noisy but I expected that after reading about it , not as bad as I thought it would be though .

55188,3,"Very convenient The only complaint from the other reviews that I can agree with is that the amount of froth on the milk is hard to control . I certainly do n't have any trouble getting hot milk . My taste in coffee is probably not very sophisticated , but this machine produces espresso and latte as good as I 've had in America . I've had my EspressoPro for 3 years and it 's still working well . When I first bought the machine , it did n't work , and the Capresso people were wonderful and immediately sent a new machine . Then there was a mixup over the color ( silver vs chrome ) , and again the Capresso people were wonderful and sent a new machine . Both times they sent me a machine immediately , with packaging to send my old machine back , so I had a new machine within two days of calling them . I always use Espressione coffee pods , and filtered water . That 's just what is most convenient for me . I 've never actually cleaned the machine 's innards , and I have n't noticed any degradation in performance over the years . The milk attachment is very convenient . We wash ours about once a week , although we do have to wash the little siphon / nozzle thing every day . It 's about as much work as a stainless jug I guess , with the advantage that you 're not wasting milk every time you make a latte . The downside to the milk attachment is that I have n't found a way to get a lot of froth out of it . It 's got a little knob on top that is supposed to control the amount of froth . It does a good job of controlling the temperature of the frothed milk , but no matter what I do , I almost always end up with around 1/2 inch of froth on my latte . Occasionally I end up with a lot more or almost none , but I have no idea why . That 's my biggest complaint . The bit where the coffee comes out into your cup ( you can see my level of sophistication there ) has two holes , so it can pour into two cups at once . This is worthless . The coffee never comes out evenly , and if you use pods you can only make a single shot at a time anyway . The end result of the two holes is that whenever I make an espresso , some of it dribbles down the side of the cup instead of going in . It 's also a bit short for any latte glass I 've ever found , and you have to tilt the glass to get it under . Despite the fact that the EspressoPro does n't look particularly tough ( it 's mostly plastic , and not really heavy plastic at that ) , Mine is still going strong after three years . Much to the dismay of my grandparents , three years is considered long enough to classify something as "" durable "" thesedays . So there you go . I 'm sure there are machines that make better espresso , but for convenience , I have n't seen any machines that can touch this one for less than twice the price . There are a couple of things I 'd like to change ( milk froth control and height of coffee dispenser ) , but I would still recommend it",611,1,0.3030570925981995,0.09000853901259566,0.011060498444810433,0.014194558637714554,0.10070755333275523,0.00017699115044249544,0.00017699115044249544,0.00017699115044249544,0.00942430968636643,0.00017699115044249544,0.00017699115044249544,0.027080701399270705,0.15399641193325894,0.00017699115044249544,0.00017699115044249544,0.00017699115044249544,0.02968195559956038,0.00017699115044249544,0.00017699115044249544,0.024391157881728246,0.00017699115044249544,0.00017699115044249544,0.00017699115044249544,0.00017699115044249544,0.00017699115044249544,0.015950581324462938,0.00017699115044249544,0.00017699115044249544,0.03019054417420044,0.00017699115044249544,0.00017699115044249544,0.00017699115044249544,0.00017699115044249544,0.00017699115044249544,0.00017699115044249544,0.00017699115044249544,0.00017699115044249544,0.00017699115044249544,0.00017699115044249544,0.03885998842176495,0.08009084687310866,0.00017699115044249544,0.031606982696656655,0.00017699115044249544,0.033680578868501405,0.00017699115044249544,0.00017699115044249544,0.00017699115044249544,0.00017699115044249544,0.00017699115044249544,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

55245,3,"Worth the Money , Just for the Fun ! I purchased the Mix It In on 9/8/06 and used it the next day . I never got soft serve . I froze the bowl again , this time in my upright freezer , and made the mix the day before and refrigerated it for 15 hours . Today , I made soft serve ! ! ! ! ! ! It is n't perfect but I 'm well on my way . I have been making the low fat version but I think the regualar version will be excellent . To make this machine work for you here are some pointers:1 . If you do n't have an upright or chest freezer , put the bowl in the back of your regular freezer . 2 . Freeze the bowl for as long as possible beyond the suggested 12 hours . 3 .

55288,3,"In love I LOVE this set . This was the first "" real "" cookware I 've ever bought . My husband and I did months of research before purchasing this set . We 've had it now for about 2 months and I ca n't express how much we 've enjoyed it . I 've read several reviews that say food sticks and so on , but I think that perhaps those people think that because it looks similar to non stick , it is . It 's not ! Think of it like this : It cooks like stainless steel and cleans up like non stick ( maybe even better ! ) . We almost went with the All Clad , but we just could n't get over how uncomfortable the handles were . Since I have n't cooked with All Clad , I ca n't compare the Calphalon One to it , but I will say they heat evenly and cook evenly . Clean up is SUPER easy ! Just this morning I made bacon and french toast . I looked at the pans and thought "" There is no way I 'll ever get this clean ! "" I poured some Bar Keeper 's friend on it and went to work with my Scotch Brite pad and within MINUTES it was spotless !

55300,3,"Wow ! This stuff is good ! I had never tried yogurt cheese before , but I was intrigued by the idea . Making the yogurt cheese was simple with this device - just fill with yogurt and leave it in the fridge . The product seems sturdy and was easy to clean . We grow our own raspberries , and I have been eating them with ice cream . Last night I tried eating them with non - fat yogurt cheese sweetened with a bit of sugar . It was delicious and much healthier ! Yogurt cheese is a good source of calcium and protein - half a cup has 85 calories , 10 grams protein , 10 grams carbohydrate , and 235 mg calcium . It would be great for layering with fruit in parfaits",137,1,0.0008695652173913539,0.0008695652173913539,0.0008695652173913539,0.08940557459733238,0.08311983602326402,0.0008695652173913539,0.0008695652173913539,0.0008695652173913539,0.0008695652173913539,0.0008695652173913539,0.04934867405618964,0.0008695652173913539,0.10191726310125124,0.0008695652173913539,0.04434760683205256,0.0008695652173913539,0.08147308613489576,0.0008695652173913539,0.0008695652173913539,0.18848901327699666,0.0008695652173913539,0.0008695652173913539,0.0008695652173913539,0.0008695652173913539,0.0008695652173913539,0.0008695652173913539,0.0008695652173913539,0.0008695652173913539,0.0008695652173913539,0.0008695652173913539,0.0008695652173913539,0.0008695652173913539,0.0008695652173913539,0.0008695652173913539,0.0008695652173913539,0.0008695652173913539,0.0008695652173913539,0.0008695652173913539,0.05013430324917933,0.11392117382685338,0.0008695652173913539,0.0008695652173913539,0.0008695652173913539,0.0008695652173913539,0.16306086020633104,0.0008695652173913539,0.0008695652173913539,0.0008695652173913539,0.0008695652173913539,0.0008695652173913539,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

55332,3,"I can finally make proper pancakes I 'm glad I bought this griddle ! I 've been stuck with teflon - coated nonstick pans for a while , and when I saw such great deals on cast iron pans , I had to buy a few . I ordered the griddle , the ~10 "" Logic grill pan , and the ~10 "" skillet . Thankfully all three qualified for free Super Saver shipping , because the cost to ship was more than the cost of the pans themselves ! The order was placed late Monday night , and I was promised that my pans would ship by the following Monday . By Wednesday the griddle had arrived , and the grill pan showed up on Friday . Way to go , UPS ! It turns out that its good to get these things early , because it takes a few days to get the "" natural finish "" pans properly seasoned . I think most of the complaints found in user reviews of cast iron cookware could have been avoided entirely had the reviewers simply taken the time to season their pans properly . Food wo n't stick to a cast iron pan if you 've taken the time to season it until it 's black and almost totally non - stick . It takes some time and paitence , but it 's the same way with a good wok : you get out of it what you put into it , and this certainly reflects in one 's cooking . Iif you 're going to buy one of these pans , DO YOUR HOMEWORK ! Ask Google about cast iron seasoning tips and instructions and you too can have an awesome cast iron pan . If you want to save some time , just buy the Logic line of pans , because saving the effort of seasoning is probably worth the massive price increase ( the logic griddle is nearly double the price of the original ) . Keep in mind that you will eventually have to re - season the pan , but hopefully not for a while ( we 'll see how the grill pan turns out).I agree with some of the other reviews , the handle could stand to be made a little longer . I am a pretty physically fit chef , and I still find the griddle to be pretty hefty . A little extra ease of carrying a heavy piece of what 's usually very hot iron would be great . I 've found that grabbing it with a folded cotton ( natural fibers do n't melt ! ) towl helps , or if you 're serious about using cast iron ( and you like to sear meat on it ) you should invest in a pair of welder 's gloves or something equally thick and heavy and fireproof . This morning I pulled the griddle out of the oven where it had spent the past few days being alternately heated , rubbed down with peanut oil , and cooled ; and I heated it up and made pancakes . You have not LIVED until you eat pancakes cooked on a hot cast iron surface . Teflon - coated pans simply can not compare . I ca n't wait to try making grilled - cheese sandwiches , omelettes , and hashed browns on this griddle . With any luck , this will be the last griddle I ever need to buy ( and hopefully the griddle my grandchildren wo n't have to buy )",602,1,0.1709482409336741,0.08440472022357892,0.00019230769230771266,0.025157497654018656,0.018159024069952595,0.00019230769230771266,0.00019230769230771266,0.00019230769230771266,0.00019230769230771266,0.00019230769230771266,0.00019230769230771266,0.00019230769230771266,0.00019230769230771266,0.00019230769230771266,0.010052714442128585,0.00019230769230771266,0.015480060653644807,0.10224655477042802,0.00019230769230771266,0.00019230769230771266,0.00019230769230771266,0.00019230769230771266,0.00019230769230771266,0.00019230769230771266,0.012622587307133806,0.00019230769230771266,0.09208566768829601,0.00019230769230771266,0.00019230769230771266,0.00019230769230771266,0.00019230769230771266,0.00019230769230771266,0.06505861120777812,0.00019230769230771266,0.00019230769230771266,0.04743234065126344,0.00019230769230771266,0.00019230769230771266,0.011597217570811112,0.033070522837259766,0.06925599193818022,0.00019230769230771266,0.023031787153002678,0.00019230769230771266,0.13231811147375167,0.00019230769230771266,0.0807321955789431,0.00019230769230771266,0.00019230769230771266,0.00019230769230771266,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0

55342,3,"Whips like a pro ! ! ! I learned a long time ago , if you go KitchenAid , you go for life . They make the highest quality , longest life products I have ever seen . This hand mixer is the third of its kind I 've owned . I 've had two of the Braun models and they died out after about a year of average use . I finally got the KitchenAid and it has been going strong for a few years now . I really like having the ability to go down to the bottom of a large pot , a full 8 "" . Even though it is of substantial weight , it fits your hand like a glove . I found it far superior to the Braun , as a matter of fact , it does n't even compare . The plastic cup with lid makes an excellent accessory since you can mix and store without wasting time . The chopper is the most efficient I have seen , does a better job that a food processor . I especially like the multi - speed dial . It goes from 1 to 9 so it has the power you need , when you need it . Egg white or whip cream does n't even challenge it , the whipping attachment makes sure of that . This baby handles like a pro . There are times when you do n't need the big mixer and the immersion blender really fills in nicely . You wo n't be disappointed with the quality , power or its sleek look",273,1,0.27627178705124356,0.0003174603174603394,0.038030580339310775,0.0003174603174603394,0.0003174603174603394,0.0003174603174603394,0.0003174603174603394,0.0374195101451657,0.0003174603174603394,0.0003174603174603394,0.0003174603174603394,0.0003174603174603394,0.2657906366135411,0.0003174603174603394,0.0003174603174603394,0.0003174603174603394,0.10161828676825607,0.0003174603174603394,0.0003174603174603394,0.025611205652028877,0.0003174603174603394,0.0003174603174603394,0.02829352051704326,0.0003174603174603394,0.0003174603174603394,0.0003174603174603394,0.0003174603174603394,0.0003174603174603394,0.0003174603174603394,0.0003174603174603394,0.0003174603174603394,0.0003174603174603394,0.0003174603174603394,0.0003174603174603394,0.0003174603174603394,0.016686698867180202,0.0003174603174603394,0.0003174603174603394,0.02639974167380991,0.08131465910114813,0.050784364444251044,0.03971551676352842,0.0003174603174603394,0.0003174603174603394,0.0003174603174603394,0.0003174603174603394,0.0003174603174603394,0.0003174603174603394,0.0003174603174603394,0.0003174603174603394,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
55355,3,"So why did I absolutely love this pan ? Well , "" um "" My dad has my first Calphalon pan . He stole it from me . ha , ha ... He loves it to cook my mom breakfast . So , I needed a new one . This pan has a triple - coated nonstick interior - nothing sticks , it just slips around . Trust me , this is important when frying eggs . There is also a certain sound that seems to be unique to these pans . The food not only cooks well , it sounds good while it is cooking . Yeah , that sounds strange , but you will see what I mean . These pans just have a touch of class to them that is unequalled . The tri - ply stainless construction includes an aluminum core . It is meticulously crafted and the pan sits flat and does n't move , even on the flat cooktops . The heat distribution is great . Flared Rim and sloped sides perfect for omelets or saut ing Stay Cool Handle - very impressive , did n't even get warm100 % dishwasher safeThis pan is also oven safe to 450 degrees , however they do n't recommend you use this for broiler use as it will damage the nonstick surface of the pan . I was skeptical because on a flat cooking surface , many pans will actually start spinning . This pan just sat there and that was impressive . The base is completely flat and that is the beauty . You would be amazed at how many pans are not completely flat . Covered by a lifetime Warranty so they will repair or replace any item that is found to be defective . The Nonstick Calphalon Cookware is a real favorite for frying because nothing sticks !

55357,3,"Excellent product for whole grain bread and muffins If you like to bake this is a nice product to have in your arsenal of tools . I bake whole grain muffins and breads every week and find this pan to be extremely useful . The breads that I have made released easily after they had cooled . I find it best to place this pan on a cooling rack for about an hour before removing the bread from the pans . If you do this it releases completely . If the bread is still warm when you try to remove it , it might not come out in one piece . I have found that it is best to put this pan on a half sheet pan prior to filling it with dough or batter . If you try to carry it to the oven without a pan underneath it , it is not very steady . If you do n't have other silicone bakeware you are unfamiliar with the nicest feature of this product . You can squish it up in a ball to store it , and bounces back to its original shape when you need it . My only complaint about this pan is that the bread does not brown as well on the bottom as sides as it does in a metal pan . But , being able to make 6 medium sized loaves at one time more than makes up for decrease in browning .",250,1,0.0005405405405405624,0.25197551355219283,0.0005405405405405624,0.09518789123375136,0.0005405405405405624,0.0005405405405405624,0.0005405405405405624,0.0005405405405405624,0.0005405405405405624,0.0005405405405405624,0.0985565994193494,0.0005405405405405624,0.0005405405405405624,0.0005405405405405624,0.054407571481779195,0.0005405405405405624,0.0005405405405405624,0.0005405405405405624,0.0005405405405405624,0.0005405405405405624,0.0005405405405405624,0.0005405405405405624,0.0005405405405405624,0.0005405405405405624,0.0005405405405405624,0.0005405405405405624,0.0005405405405405624,0.0005405405405405624,0.0005405405405405624,0.0005405405405405624,0.0005405405405405624,0.0005405405405405624,0.0005405405405405624,0.0005405405405405624,0.0005405405405405624,0.0005405405405405624,0.0005405405405405624,0.0005405405405405624,0.08812967708777718,0.1115026628852345,0.0005405405405405624,0.0005405405405405624,0.0005405405405405624,0.0005405405405405624,0.0005405405405405624,0.0005405405405405624,0.2769968410966713,0.0005405405405405624,0.0005405405405405624,0.0005405405405405624,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
55360,3,"Perfect little kitchen helper I bought a dozen of these from another retailer ( at half price ) and I love them ! They are perfect for everything that requires a small size container . I use the cups to beat two eggs , melt butter , heat up baby food ( never heat food in any plastic ) , to serve ketchup or other condiments , store a small amount of leftovers , etc .

55362,3,"Lovely Little Bowls For Great Price * * * * * I bought two sets of four bowls to complement my nice set of everyday dishes for times when you want just a little bit of something --- like a little yogurt , or some granola , some fresh raspberries --- and we use them all the time . I agree with a previous reviewer that they would be wonderful for food prep . They are not thin , as a previous reviewer has noted . They are not thick or bulky either , though , just perfect . They seem like they will last a long time and wear quite well . They almost look , well ... elegant , which seems kind of cool for just Pyrex and for the price . The bowls come well - packaged , and although the price is very low , they definitely do n't seem cheaply made . I have n't seen them in stores , either .

55370,3,"So far I am very pleased ! ! ! Had this on my Amazon wish list , but then came across it for the same price at a Target store and bought it ( sorry Amazon ) . And I really am pleased so far . My toddler has allergies and his allergist had recommended an air purifier for his room . We did lots of research in looking for the right one that was still affordable . I really like that this one has washable filters . Lots of $ $ $ savings there . Since getting this , my son has had fewer runny noses and no severe allergy symptons . We 've even been able to drop two of his three allergy meds - - not sure yet though if this is due to the seasons , or perhaps we were possibly over - medicating him before , or if this thing really does work that kind of miracle . Either way , fewer snotty noses makes me happy . In regard to the concerns over noise , this one is fairly quiet . I keep it on low pretty much all the time and it is hardly noticeable . My son has no problem sleeping with it running in the same room . The oscillating feature is nice and it has a small nightlight on it that comes in handy .

55371,3,"Excellent Little Heater I bought this heater three years ago based on the good reviews and cheap price . I expected it to get me through that winter only . I have used this thing just about daily for the past three years , heat in fall / winter and fan in summer . It still works quite well and seems ready for the upcoming winter . The only problem I am beginning to notice now is that the on / off / heat control wheel is starting to become loose . Otherwise it does a great job for the intended task and has already lasted longer than anticipated . The thermostat on it is finicky and takes a little playing around with it to do basically what you want but the heat does cycle on / off more or less appropriately . I 'd give 5 stars if the thermostat was perfect but it is what it is and that is good enough . I just bought two more , my old one will go to the garage for duty there until it eventually fails .

The thermometer seems stable , I never have a problem with it getting too hot in the winter , and it manages to heat my efficiency apartment very well . The cord is ' regular ' length so it 's not tiny and I do n't need an extension cord . Over all on a students budget I 've definitely found a winner",117,1,0.0009090909090909486,0.26675181108384277,0.0009090909090909486,0.0009090909090909486,0.0009090909090909486,0.0009090909090909486,0.0009090909090909486,0.0009090909090909486,0.0009090909090909486,0.0009090909090909486,0.0009090909090909486,0.0009090909090909486,0.33517908997905627,0.0009090909090909486,0.0009090909090909486,0.0009090909090909486,0.0009090909090909486,0.0009090909090909486,0.09181818181818445,0.06821644532379056,0.0009090909090909486,0.0009090909090909486,0.07082366962106305,0.0009090909090909486,0.0009090909090909486,0.0009090909090909486,0.0009090909090909486,0.0009090909090909486,0.0009090909090909486,0.052498357170915756,0.0009090909090909486,0.0009090909090909486,0.0009090909090909486,0.0009090909090909486,0.0009090909090909486,0.0009090909090909486,0.0009090909090909486,0.0009090909090909486,0.0009090909090909486,0.0009090909090909486,0.0009090909090909486,0.0009090909090909486,0.07562153591223655,0.0009090909090909486,0.0009090909090909486,0.0009090909090909486,0.0009090909090909486,0.0009090909090909486,0.0009090909090909486,0.0009090909090909486,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1
55373,3,"Great press and fantastic accessories ! I 've had another press for many years , but I could n't get to it and had cravings for some Spritz cookies . So ... I went out and bought this cookie press and to my amazement was very impressed with all the additional accessories it came with . The press worked beautifully ( I 've only used the small barrel so far . ) I was concerned that it was battery operated , my last one was a plug in model . But it is nice not to be limited to working near a plug . We had no problems with the unit , it worked quite nicely . I 'm looking forward to trying out some of the accessory attachments in the future .

55376,3,"So Delish ! ! ! This product works wonders ! I am big into making my own flavors , and making healthier than store bought versions . This machine is great for that ! It is n't loud at all , definately a big upgrade from the salt and ice mixer I used to have that could wake up the dead . The fact that you just pop your ingredients in the canister and stick it in is amazing , no messy clean up whatsoever , or need for trips to the store for ice / salt . The only slight disadvantage is that if you want to add toppings that spread throughout , you need to add it after its almost at icecream consistency and for that you have to pop off the top ( there s no slide window to add through while its mixing ) . But even doing that extra step is simple after 30 min 's of churning . Soft ice cream DEFINATELY never takes longer than 45 , usually 37 - 40 , and hard is about 45 - 48 min . Buy it and Enjoy ! !",194,1,0.0005882352941177123,0.13826571571845203,0.0005882352941177123,0.0005882352941177123,0.08717454584941116,0.0005882352941177123,0.030000000000001234,0.0005882352941177123,0.0005882352941177123,0.0005882352941177123,0.03517887877496883,0.0005882352941177123,0.0005882352941177123,0.0005882352941177123,0.0005882352941177123,0.0005882352941177123,0.056219606068171626,0.15964475433494843,0.029976635837864397,0.0005882352941177123,0.0005882352941177123,0.0005882352941177123,0.0005882352941177123,0.0005882352941177123,0.0005882352941177123,0.0005882352941177123,0.0005882352941177123,0.0005882352941177123,0.0005882352941177123,0.08172047519664181,0.0005882352941177123,0.0005882352941177123,0.0005882352941177123,0.0005882352941177123,0.0005882352941177123,0.0005882352941177123,0.0005882352941177123,0.0005882352941177123,0.0005882352941177123,0.23833508435350598,0.0005882352941177123,0.0005882352941177123,0.0005882352941177123,0.0005882352941177123,0.11995489210132605,0.0005882352941177123,0.0005882352941177123,0.0005882352941177123,0.0005882352941177123,0.0005882352941177123,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

55407,3,"Excellent pan and lifetime guarantee -- excellent buy ! I have a set of 16-year - old Farberware . I ordered this 3 qt . pan as a replacement -- the handle on my old 3 qt . cracked from where the screw hole is . After I received this beautiful pan , I noticed the limited lifetime guarantee , called the number , and a new handle for my old pan is in the mail to me as we speak . This 3 qt . pan is even nicer than the pans I bought almost 20 years ago and is higher than the old model with a nicer lid / rolled edges and nicer bottom -- and it really is beautiful -- very classic styling . Since I use them so often and new one 's so lovely , I will definitely keep the new one even though a replacement handle is on its way . I also have a 1 qt . , 2 qt . , 4 qt . pot , 4 qt . dutch oven , 10 "" skillet and little mini - skillet , all of which I use all the time ( I use at least one or more daily ) with no problems . Very nice , basic cookware at a reasonable , affordable price . I bought my cookware individually back when I could n't afford to buy an entire set . I loved the fact that you could buy a quality pan individually . BTW , I acquired one of my 4 qt . pots from my grandmother 's possessions after who knows how many decades of cooking and it 's still in excellent condition . Also have her double boiler pot . Even though the screws do loosen , I only have to tighten every few months at most and have never had a screw strip or lost a handle . I would always buy another Farberware if needed ( after seeing this new saucepan , would really like to buy a whole set of it , even though I do n't really need it !",356,1,0.00028985507246379,0.14078190344553532,0.01201666174063322,0.036829864602910725,0.00028985507246379,0.011937264856693379,0.00028985507246379,0.00028985507246379,0.00028985507246379,0.00028985507246379,0.00028985507246379,0.014782608695649794,0.00028985507246379,0.00028985507246379,0.00028985507246379,0.00028985507246379,0.06454610356923567,0.14493474255115457,0.014782608695651444,0.00028985507246379,0.00028985507246379,0.00028985507246379,0.00028985507246379,0.08993659151294457,0.00028985507246379,0.08307977120178628,0.03167526377364523,0.00028985507246379,0.00028985507246379,0.00028985507246379,0.00028985507246379,0.00028985507246379,0.00028985507246379,0.00028985507246379,0.00028985507246379,0.00028985507246379,0.00028985507246379,0.00028985507246379,0.09705433688900592,0.00028985507246379,0.0742270460537475,0.00028985507246379,0.029957242302178666,0.00028985507246379,0.00028985507246379,0.00028985507246379,0.1433130625729952,0.00028985507246379,0.00028985507246379,0.00028985507246379,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

55421,3,"Color is odd but it works fine . The Black plastic looks a little odd . It 's not glossy like the picture . It does n't look really clean even after you clean it is the only way I can discribe it . I bought 2 of these for the office to replace our old ones because we burnt a Pop Tart and the rest of the building was less that thrilled that the Fire Department had to respond . This one is suppose to shut down if something gets stuck in it . Good Idea . But , the instructions still say not to cook Pop Tarts unattended anyway . Now they tell us . There is a toaster with a Pop Tart Logo , the Toastmaster 2035 . If you want a laugh , read the review for that one . Bottom line , for the money , this toaster works great . I like the lift feature a lot .

55431,3,"Hands down this beats other manufactors Perhaps like you , I love silicone . You can do anything with silicone . You can fry , poach , make soups , and there is never a worry about heat . Le Crueset makes fine quality silicone utensils , but their wood is unfinished , so unless you keep them oiled , they will age and spilter . These you can remove the top if you like but the wooden handles are treated , and are water resistant . In addition to these being made for the long hall , their shape is unique . I like that the shape is slightly angled , this makes it easier to run along the edges of a bowl . I have been so happy with my purchase of these ! I ca n't say enough good things about them . I would recommend these over other manufactors , they are better made , and improve in others weaker areas .

55472,3,"Finally , I have a real coffee grinder ! After suffering for years with blade grinders and cheaper burr grinders , I decided to take the plunge and get the Capresso Infinity in brushed chrome . This grinder addresses all the problems I had with the lesser machines : it 's fairly quiet , free of static , grinds evenly , and is easy to clean ( although unless you use really oily beans , you should n't need to clean it very often ) . I do n't make espresso , but I 've used it to grind coffee for moka pots , French press , and drip coffeemakers , all with great success . Just a note on its construction : the difference between the chrome versions and the ABS plastic version is more than just the finish or a metal skin . The chrome versions have a "" zinc die - cast housing , "" weigh almost twice as much as the ABS plastic version , and are very stable . Also , as usual , Amazon has inflated the price to make it seem like they 're offering us a bargain when they 're not . The list price on the manufacturer 's website is $ 139.99 , not $ 190 .

55473,3,"At last ! A home - made pizza worth eating ! I was helped in choosing this pizza stone by the hundreds of online reviews and suggestions posted by people from all over . Well , they were all right . Excellent item . I bought two stones and used them simultaneously for the first two homemade pizzas of my life ... DELICIOUS ! As others have suggested , I never remove the stone from the oven , and lately I just placed a pan containing the dough for an olive focaccia and it came out perfectly done . I am convinced that the stone works its magic also when not used to bake directly on it . I am extremely happy so far and I 'd highly recommend this item .

55525,3,"Good knife for the money This was my first ' nice ' knife when I was taken in by the Santoku craze , and it was certainly a decent choice . The knife is sharp out of the box , reasonably well balanced , and has pretty good fit / finish . For the type of person who only buys things like veggies and boneless / skinless chicken , etc . , that are largely prepared , this knife will probably fit the bill and allow you finish up small amounts of prep work . The real drawback is the length . When you live in the South , you see vidalia onions that are 7 "" in diameter . This knife is a bit small to tackle the large veggies . And do n't even think about getting it near hard melons or bone - in meats . Since I got this knife , I 've expanded my collection quite a bit , even adding some real Japanese steel . But this little blade keeps a spot on my magnetic strip , where it comes out for small tasks or when my wife ca n't get me to relinquish the big blade . For most cooks , who need a real omni - tasker knife , I would look for a 9 - 10 "" chef 's knife rather than this .",233,1,0.2924118905076519,0.1569066678916371,0.0004651162790698013,0.022434275344916526,0.0004651162790698013,0.0004651162790698013,0.0004651162790698013,0.09342800208619668,0.0004651162790698013,0.0004651162790698013,0.0004651162790698013,0.0004651162790698013,0.0433463176542015,0.0004651162790698013,0.0004651162790698013,0.0004651162790698013,0.0004651162790698013,0.0004651162790698013,0.0004651162790698013,0.0004651162790698013,0.0004651162790698013,0.12004270324627421,0.0004651162790698013,0.04168814638796968,0.10439832176771359,0.0004651162790698013,0.03443295749312602,0.0004651162790698013,0.0004651162790698013,0.020214536574544608,0.0004651162790698013,0.0004651162790698013,0.0004651162790698013,0.0004651162790698013,0.0004651162790698013,0.024480497737159178,0.0004651162790698013,0.0004651162790698013,0.0004651162790698013,0.02854126470395662,0.0004651162790698013,0.0004651162790698013,0.0004651162790698013,0.0004651162790698013,0.0004651162790698013,0.0004651162790698013,0.0004651162790698013,0.0004651162790698013,0.0004651162790698013,0.0004651162790698013,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

55556,3,"Easy and Cool In The Kitchen We had been enjoying the whole experience of the Keurig B50 , when I got the email and blogsite updates over the past few months that Keurig was promoting a new and improved single - cup brewer . I confess - I coveted this new machine in a big way . So when we were the recipients of a bright shiny new B70 last week on our front stoop , it was very much like Christmas for me . My wife just smiled , and the kids gave out a sincere , "" Whoa , that 's cool ! "" at our new kitchen friend . Everything that we liked about the B50 is there for the B70 - with the addition of larger cup sizes and the overall look and feel . The coffee just tastes good , first and foremost . I 've tasted cups from other single - serve brewers , and most of them have been barely more appetizing than generic vending machine drop - the - cup coffee . From my first experience with the Keurig machines , however , I was amazed how good the brew tasted . The home brewers make a great cup of coffee without having to waste a pot , or lose the coffee all over the counter when the previous machine 's brew basket got finicky . The additional My K - cup attachments allow for grinding our own beans , too - so as a coffee snob , I 'm hooked . The Platinum B70 adds selection for cup size - right now , I think our best default size is 9.25 oz , filling out most travel mugs and our normal in - house mugs well without getting watery on the k - cups we 've tried so far . And it has a larger reservoir for water , meaning we can get more coffee for fewer refills in the kitchen sink . All of these things would be enough , right?But wow , it is just so cool looking . The blue LED lights that make the water glow on the left , and the blue LCD screen on the right that shows the clock , menu , cup selection , and the chrome fixtures - even the spring - loaded holder in the front top of the brewer - all of that combines to make it more than just a good coffee , taking us into the realm of a really cool experience . The kids oooo and aaahhh every time they walk into the evening kitchen , seeing Daddy 's glowing blue coffee brewer , just wanting to marvel in its glow .... okay , that 's a little too melodramatic , but only slightly . If you like coffee and spend more than $ 10 per day , or throw away more than a third of a pot of coffee each morning , or if you enjoy coffee but avoid making it at night because for just one cup that whole pot will go to waste - I think you owe it to yourself to try this brewer out . Not just in the store , but blue and glowing in your own kitchen . Trust me - "" Merry Christmas "" is a great feeling",559,1,0.2795430999518722,0.12078542429733798,0.0001754385964912447,0.03321600998046145,0.05554469628448029,0.021709084659024127,0.03714633454607373,0.0001754385964912447,0.009698968960953555,0.0001754385964912447,0.0001754385964912447,0.0001754385964912447,0.1084276343407241,0.0001754385964912447,0.0001754385964912447,0.0001754385964912447,0.0501784571219187,0.0001754385964912447,0.0001754385964912447,0.1457556088804431,0.0001754385964912447,0.0287567769136428,0.0001754385964912447,0.0001754385964912447,0.0001754385964912447,0.0001754385964912447,0.0001754385964912447,0.0001754385964912447,0.0001754385964912447,0.0001754385964912447,0.0001754385964912447,0.0001754385964912447,0.0001754385964912447,0.0001754385964912447,0.0166462335230396,0.0001754385964912447,0.0001754385964912447,0.0001754385964912447,0.0001754385964912447,0.04344553154830156,0.0001754385964912447,0.0001754385964912447,0.04283034951804194,0.0001754385964912447,0.0001754385964912447,0.0001754385964912447,0.0001754385964912447,0.0001754385964912447,0.0001754385964912447,0.0001754385964912447,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
55561,3,"Terrific I feel obligated to defend this terrific appliance against the "" misguided "" reviewer who likened it to a jack - hammer . That review gave me pause when I was considering ordering it . Fortunately I had faith in Amazon 's return policy and decided to give it a chance . It 's not at all too heavy or too large . I 'm 5 ' 3 "" with small hands and it fits in my hand perfectly . It really is ergonomically designed . The power button falls directly under your fingers when you hold it . You have no need to change your grip until you 're through blending -- which is next to no time . It blends thoroughly and efficiently . It does have enough weight to give you some control . You would n't want something this powerful to be too light -- it could just fly out of your grasp . This feels solid , is very attractive , and also appears to be very well made . I love it . If you think you might want an immersion blender ( and if you cook , you do ) you 'll love it too . It should be noted that this is also called an immersion blender . I was confused by the two designations -- hand blender / immersion blender .

55566,3,"Quite happy with ours I am surprised to see so many negative reviews . We 've had ours for five or six years , use it at least daily , and have been quite satisified with its performance . It generally toasts the bread evenly , and is consistent from batch to batch and from one day to the next . It does n't seem that slow to me , but my expectations may differ from yours . I agree the 2/4 slice switch is confusing , but we just leave it on the four - slice setting . I also agree it is a bit pricey , but most of our previous toasters only lasted a couple of years and did not perform as consistently . Perhaps Cuisinart has a quality control problem , but we would n't hesitate to buy another one .

55613,3,very good i bought this after reading many reviews and found that they were all in 2 catagories either you loved it or you hated it . i am no exception i really like it . it works like a dream on plush high pile carpets that you ca n't really run a regular vacuum cleaner over . i do n't have any trouble getting it to pick up dirt . the price was great ( less than $ 30 ) and bags and belts are easy to find and inexpensive . it could have a little more suction in the hose for attachments but it still picks up dirt well . the best use i get out of it is the roller brush . the roller is very strong and keeps going even when used on deep pile carpets,140,1,0.0008000000000000533,0.0008000000000000533,0.0008000000000000533,0.0008000000000000533,0.17919071743414025,0.04080000010792588,0.0008000000000000533,0.0008000000000000533,0.0008000000000000533,0.0008000000000000533,0.0008000000000000533,0.0008000000000000533,0.0008000000000000533,0.0008000000000000533,0.0008000000000000533,0.0008000000000000533,0.0008000000000000533,0.09150245382924795,0.04071718111183704,0.0008000000000000533,0.0008000000000000533,0.16892039679793502,0.0008000000000000533,0.0008000000000000533,0.0008000000000000533,0.0008000000000000533,0.0008000000000000533,0.0008000000000000533,0.0008000000000000533,0.0008000000000000533,0.0008000000000000533,0.0008000000000000533,0.18909817388174419,0.0008000000000000533,0.0008000000000000533,0.0008000000000000533,0.0008000000000000533,0.0008000000000000533,0.0008000000000000533,0.0008000000000000533,0.0008000000000000533,0.0008000000000000533,0.0008000000000000533,0.0008000000000000533,0.10414120220701142,0.0008000000000000533,0.15202987463015624,0.0008000000000000533,0.0008000000000000533,0.0008000000000000533,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0

55615,3,"Surprisingly good kitchen shears I used to sell cutlery and own a range of knives myself , so I have tried many cutlery products from many different brands . In 2003 , I bought these Calphalon Contemporary shears since I did not own a pair of shears . Before I purchased these , I tried a pair of Henckels Twinshear kitchen shears , and felt that they were not as strong and sharp as I would have liked . I was a little worried about the quality of these shears since they were made in China rather than in Germany or Japan , even though newer brands such as Calphalon and Furi are now making far better cutlery than has ever before been made in China . After over a year of using these , I am quite impressed with them . The handles are very comfortable , and the blades are stronger and sharper than the aforementioned Henckels shears . Most impressively , the blades show very little wear , despite the fact I have certainly used them quite often . Also , the handles on these are far better compared to those on the Calphalon Traditional and Stainless shears . In conclusion , I would definitely recommend these to anyone looking for a top - quality , reasonably priced set of kitchen shears",225,1,0.0005405405405406002,0.0005405405405406002,0.06843861267534554,0.0005405405405406002,0.0005405405405406002,0.0005405405405406002,0.0005405405405406002,0.0005405405405406002,0.0005405405405406002,0.0005405405405406002,0.04533531607406048,0.0005405405405406002,0.11334080746238626,0.0005405405405406002,0.0005405405405406002,0.0005405405405406002,0.0005405405405406002,0.07058737987090816,0.0005405405405406002,0.10368033650366454,0.0005405405405406002,0.3303876673057643,0.0005405405405406002,0.0005405405405406002,0.0005405405405406002,0.03186715428898715,0.0005405405405406002,0.0005405405405406002,0.0005405405405406002,0.0005405405405406002,0.0005405405405406002,0.0005405405405406002,0.06891317326018755,0.0005405405405406002,0.0005405405405406002,0.0005405405405406002,0.0005405405405406002,0.0005405405405406002,0.0005405405405406002,0.029818590670340976,0.0005405405405406002,0.026047341052122305,0.0005405405405406002,0.0005405405405406002,0.0005405405405406002,0.0005405405405406002,0.09050253975514916,0.0005405405405406002,0.0005405405405406002,0.0005405405405406002,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

It has a 2-minute auto shut - off switch , and a supposedly low - battery indication . Overall , this is a very good scale and I recommend it if you 're willing to put up with purchasing a lithium battery once in a while",214,1,0.05211638194527978,0.0006060606060606493,0.0006060606060606493,0.08079650239799512,0.0006060606060606493,0.0006060606060606493,0.0006060606060606493,0.0006060606060606493,0.15164730860498127,0.0006060606060606493,0.11769547782471358,0.08782443529747247,0.0006060606060606493,0.0006060606060606493,0.0006060606060606493,0.0006060606060606493,0.0006060606060606493,0.0006060606060606493,0.0006060606060606493,0.0006060606060606493,0.0006060606060606493,0.0006060606060606493,0.16520317596749876,0.0006060606060606493,0.0006060606060606493,0.0006060606060606493,0.0006060606060606493,0.0006060606060606493,0.0006060606060606493,0.07386990575667102,0.0006060606060606493,0.08459449365327176,0.13104088570464997,0.0006060606060606493,0.0006060606060606493,0.03096900860504024,0.0006060606060606493,0.0006060606060606493,0.0006060606060606493,0.0006060606060606493,0.0006060606060606493,0.0006060606060606493,0.0006060606060606493,0.0006060606060606493,0.0006060606060606493,0.0006060606060606493,0.0006060606060606493,0.0006060606060606493,0.0006060606060606493,0.0006060606060606493,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

55642,3,"So far , so good I purchased this product the day before going on vacation , so i did n't have much time to research . I 've owned it for 28 days , and it 's been working fine so far . I use small pellets , not flakes- so that 's all i can rate it for . It seems to work at the same times every day , and a uniform amount of food appears to drop . It is not quiet , so if it is used in a bedroom , make sure you adjust your feeding times as not to be disturbed while sleeping . I acually do n't mind knowing when it 's running , so if i 'm around I can check on it 's function . Time will tell if it 's a great product- but so far , so good . I must change my review- I too had one of the battery contacts break off , and the unit became unreliable . I 'd often have to remove and replace the batteries to get it to work again .

I have several sets , and many of them were quite exepensive , but i always seem to reach for these sheets . The only time we use another set is when we are washing these . They are very soft and stretchy ( not too stretchy)and wash up so nice(they hold the dryer warmth so well ) ! This set has been great during the summer and i think will also be great during the colder months with a heavier blanket .

55664,3,"Love the little packets ! I have made yogurt with a few tablespoons from the super market or with a previous batch , but sometimes I sweeten the whole batch with honey and forget to reserve some of the good stuff . I probably use these every other batch or so now . When I first started making yogurt , using these packets allowed me to vary the time and/or add powdered milk until I found my perfect batch ! I do n't add powdered milk - it makes it thicker but more tart and I prefer it a bit thinner after getting addicted to it in Europe last year .

55717,3,"Very Nicely - Built Aebleskiver Pan I 've been cooking aebleskivers for several years in an excellent no - name cast iron pan that I bought in Solvang ten years ago . It is very well broken in with a smooth non - stick patina in all seven indents . I want to teach my sons how to cook aebleskivers themselves because they will be out on their own soon , and it never hurts to be able to attract a woman who loves Danish delicacies ! Therefore , I have been looking to buy some additional aebleskiver pans and I was excited to see this new pan from Lodge , so I ordered one to give it a try . I like the design a lot and am impressed with how it heats up quickly and holds it 's temperature nicely . The first batch of aebleskivers had some sticking , but I expected that . I will need to use it a lot more before it has the same non - stick surfaces as my old pan ( no , it 's not for sale ! ) , but I can tell that this pan will get there with use . By the way , I 've found that there are many recipes for aebleskivers and several different techniques for cooking them . I 'm sure that they all will work well with some practice , but I 'll describe the one that I 've settled on , because it is so easy : Heat the pan at a medium - low setting . Take about two cups of prepared pancake mix ( I use Krusteaz Buttermilk ) and add a couple of teaspoons of sugar . Mix it in and stir in enough cold water to make the consistency about the same as you would for drop bisquits . Do n't overmix it and let it sit for awhile to rise a bit before you cook it . Put a little butter or margerine in each indent and add about a teaspoonful of batter to each indent ( If you 're new to aebleskivers , I recommend trying only three at once . ) I then drizzle a little butter on the edges of each indent . After about a minute , I use a knitting needle ( or chopstick ) to turn each aebleskiver one quarter turn . I add a little more butter and then turn them so the round side is up . I keep turning them with a spoon until they 're done . ( You 'll just have to break one of them open to check , because it 's dependent on your batter and temperature.)Once you get it down ( usually after a few rejects ) , serve them in threes on a small plate with thinned out raspberry jam and powdered sugar . Once you eat them , you 'll understand why people go through all this just to make a pancake that looks like a racquetball !",508,1,0.0002469135802469366,0.19206432839807733,0.0002469135802469366,0.0002469135802469366,0.0002469135802469366,0.0002469135802469366,0.0002469135802469366,0.0002469135802469366,0.03469907831912041,0.0002469135802469366,0.0002469135802469366,0.013247017527641717,0.2059352819345347,0.0002469135802469366,0.0002469135802469366,0.0002469135802469366,0.0002469135802469366,0.031956077827069426,0.0002469135802469366,0.04337294789778945,0.0002469135802469366,0.0002469135802469366,0.0002469135802469366,0.0002469135802469366,0.0002469135802469366,0.0002469135802469366,0.01955435701190934,0.0002469135802469366,0.0002469135802469366,0.03671976176357157,0.0002469135802469366,0.0002469135802469366,0.014770908416920697,0.0002469135802469366,0.0002469135802469366,0.012594096029237086,0.0002469135802469366,0.0002469135802469366,0.0002469135802469366,0.0002469135802469366,0.06933780672894128,0.0002469135802469366,0.017828344338447235,0.0002469135802469366,0.12556828666081446,0.0002469135802469366,0.17346281825703566,0.0002469135802469366,0.0002469135802469366,0.0002469135802469366,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0

55746,3,"Like having a coffe shop in your kitchen I first would like to say that if you are the occasional esspresso drinker , then this machine is to costly to use every once in a while go with a cheaper brand . Now for the rest of you that are die hard esspresso drinkers this is the machine for you . I moved from AK to NY a few months ago , while I lived in AK ( ALASKA ) there were coffe shops on every corner , to say the least I was addicted to mochas , and moving to NY they are few and far between . I was going into withdrawl . After doing some research I found this great machine . I wanted to use it for a while before writing a review about it . I love this machine . This machine is fast and the esspresso is great . I am a fan of regular esspresso as well and it comes out at a consistanly high quality , the Crema is perfect , however I found if you are using the single shot it does n't come out that great so always use the double shot . The machine heats up quickly and everything is provided for you , two cups , two saucers , a pitcher and a frothing attachment . I can see that this machine will pay for itself withing no time . I have owned cheaper models in the past and you can really tell the difference in the quality of the esspresso . I have not used the pod attachment so I ca n't comment on that . If you buy the machine in my opinion you wo nt be disappointed",292,1,0.0003448275862069416,0.0003448275862069416,0.06968820370058745,0.0003448275862069416,0.22851106811116248,0.018187931191623347,0.0003448275862069416,0.0003448275862069416,0.0003448275862069416,0.0003448275862069416,0.0003448275862069416,0.0003448275862069416,0.10950180307256618,0.0003448275862069416,0.0003448275862069416,0.0003448275862069416,0.0003448275862069416,0.042041148988290505,0.0003448275862069416,0.021017487287809715,0.0003448275862069416,0.0003448275862069416,0.0003448275862069416,0.02131486784569015,0.0003448275862069416,0.02562895967479453,0.0003448275862069416,0.0003448275862069416,0.017683420017498307,0.0003448275862069416,0.0003448275862069416,0.0003448275862069416,0.12588320855527507,0.0003448275862069416,0.0003448275862069416,0.0003448275862069416,0.0003448275862069416,0.0003448275862069416,0.0003448275862069416,0.0003448275862069416,0.024571164022149296,0.0003448275862069416,0.056724909360026964,0.066376155343685,0.049191095377251144,0.0003448275862069416,0.11160961193434675,0.0003448275862069416,0.0003448275862069416,0.0003448275862069416,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0
55760,3,"We made not only the right choice but the Best Choice ! For years we have used the Mr. Coffee Iced Tea makers and have purchased two of them . This time around we chose to get the Hamilton Beach 40911 2-qt Iced Tea Maker . Even though I / we have n't used the feature that allows you to place loose tea in the basket for brewing we totally like the Hamilton Beach method of brewing tea over the Mr. Coffee . First of all the taste ( using Luzianne Family Tea bags was superior to any tea we ever brewed using the Mr. Coffee makers . Also one very large drawback with the Mr. Coffee maker is that the basket , for the bags , sets inside the reservoir and maker and most every time you brew a pitcher and remove the basket you have leakage of tea down in the makers bottom which over time makes for a very ugly looking reservoir , where you put your clean water to brew your next pitcher . Because Hamilton Beach placed the basket directly inside the Pitcher itself there is never any tea that finds its way into the bottom of the tea maker . Also due to ridges in the bottom of the Mr. Coffee maker it 's usually almost impossible to totally clean the pitcher and restore it back to the clean condition at the time you first used it . This feature alone makes the Hamilton Beach a better buy over the Mr. Coffee but I thought , before my purchase , that surely the two would make equivalent tasting tea but using both Lipton and Luzianne Family Tea bags the Hamilton Beach not only brews the tea faster but the taste IS Better . On the Mr. Coffee the strength of the tea is controlled by a sliding knob on the front of the maker whereas with the Hamilton Beach it is three rigid clicks of control on the bottom of the basket ( mild , medium , strong ) , we usually use Medium . We enjoy "" Sweet - Tea "" being from the South and anyone that makes good sweet tea knows you sweeten it while it 's hot at the time of brewing . Our method is to first fill the pitcher to the line and fill the reservoir and refill the pitcher to the same water level and then add 2 1/4 to 2 1/2 cups of sugar and stir with a whisk until very well mixed . Once the tea is brewed you have to stir the tea again but you get perfect sweet tea every - time . If you enjoy tea , even if you never considered an electric tea maker , the Hamilton Beach will be one purchase decision you will not regret . Having two Mr. Coffee makers before this Hamilton Beach I do n't see myself ever purchasing another Mr. Coffee unless they make many changes to their product and even then taste is the final decision maker . I HIGHLY recommend the Hamilton Beach model and would gladly buy it again even if it was higher priced than the Mr. Coffee , it 's totally worth it",544,1,0.3277900654866294,0.00022471910112361224,0.00022471910112361224,0.061598252617460415,0.00022471910112361224,0.00022471910112361224,0.00022471910112361224,0.00022471910112361224,0.00022471910112361224,0.00022471910112361224,0.06198618927368898,0.018791990699630227,0.00022471910112361224,0.00022471910112361224,0.00022471910112361224,0.00022471910112361224,0.00022471910112361224,0.035191273533755396,0.00022471910112361224,0.00022471910112361224,0.00022471910112361224,0.00022471910112361224,0.00022471910112361224,0.00022471910112361224,0.00022471910112361224,0.00022471910112361224,0.00022471910112361224,0.00022471910112361224,0.00022471910112361224,0.00022471910112361224,0.00022471910112361224,0.12071669066272422,0.00022471910112361224,0.00022471910112361224,0.00022471910112361224,0.00022471910112361224,0.00022471910112361224,0.00022471910112361224,0.00022471910112361224,0.14168629052636633,0.018172100339040667,0.00022471910112361224,0.039410533698287224,0.00022471910112361224,0.00022471910112361224,0.060205138491470495,0.10568742972712587,0.00022471910112361224,0.00022471910112361224,0.00022471910112361224,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0
55764,3,Good all purpose turner Calling it short is a misnomer - it 's not that short - it 's an average size . It has a rather bulky handle that is comfortable to hold but difficult to store . The turner itself is a little on the thick side so lighter foods do n't always want to cooperate but I 'm pleased with it . I would n't buy a matching spoon becuase of the bulky handle - takes up too much room in my drawer,86,1,0.0013333333333333962,0.3149057378763184,0.0013333333333333962,0.0013333333333333962,0.0013333333333333962,0.0013333333333333962,0.0013333333333333962,0.0013333333333333962,0.0013333333333333962,0.0013333333333333962,0.0013333333333333962,0.0013333333333333962,0.0013333333333333962,0.0013333333333333962,0.0013333333333333962,0.0013333333333333962,0.26478049617699523,0.13788606583134236,0.0013333333333333962,0.0013333333333333962,0.0013333333333333962,0.0013333333333333962,0.0013333333333333962,0.0013333333333333962,0.0013333333333333962,0.22109436678200797,0.0013333333333333962,0.0013333333333333962,0.0013333333333333962,0.0013333333333333962,0.0013333333333333962,0.0013333333333333962,0.0013333333333333962,0.0013333333333333962,0.0013333333333333962,0.0013333333333333962,0.0013333333333333962,0.0013333333333333962,0.0013333333333333962,0.0013333333333333962,0.0013333333333333962,0.0013333333333333962,0.0013333333333333962,0.0013333333333333962,0.0013333333333333962,0.0013333333333333962,0.0013333333333333962,0.0013333333333333962,0.0013333333333333962,0.0013333333333333962,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
55772,3,"Fantastic idea , beautifully simple This is a fantastic idea for teaballs . Sleek and stylish , this set is also practical . The two teaballs are spring - loaded , and perfectly sized for a single cup of tea . Simply press the plunger , then stir the ball around in your loose tea container . Lift it out of the tea and shake the excess out to level the tea . Let go of the plunger , and the teaball closes securely . The long stem on the balls allow you to take the ball out of your cup ( or stir the tea as it 's brewing , if that 's your preference ) without having to lift a hot chain off of the side of your cup of hot water . Prior to this purchase , we used a tea ' spoon ' , which also spring - loaded shut . The problem with the spoon is that to fill it with tea , you have to hold it vertically in the container , which means you have few options - either close the spoon while the tea is still sticking out the sides , and fill your cup with loose tea , or try to shake the extra tea out after you pull the spoon of the container , and get tea all over your counter . Because of these teaballs ' design , they do n't share that problem . The tower has one interesting feature , but some shortcomings . The good design is that below where each teaball hangs , there is a significant ' bowl ' to catch any tea that might still be dripping . This has proven to be a very handy feature . The tower itself is n't very mobile , however . Due to how the hooks hold the teaball stems , it is seemingly impossible to move without one of the balls falling out . Also , when I got mine , the tower was visibly crooked , and I had to bend it back straight . That worked for me , but was quite hard , and I was worried I 'd break it . Oh , cleanup - cleanup is much easier than with the aforementioned spoon . The spoon hinges so that there is little clearance at the back of the utensil for washing out . These balls do n't share that problem at all . The plunger gives more than adequate clearance to simply turn the ball sideways and wash it out in the sink ( just make sure your sink 's filter is in!)All in all , I 'm pleased with the purchase . It 's such a fantastic idea that a few shortcomings do n't significantly mar how well the product works",472,1,0.00040000000000004285,0.16415316442774483,0.00040000000000004285,0.00040000000000004285,0.00040000000000004285,0.00040000000000004285,0.00040000000000004285,0.00040000000000004285,0.04144753098600429,0.00040000000000004285,0.017271348222181526,0.00040000000000004285,0.0850903235361016,0.00040000000000004285,0.00040000000000004285,0.00040000000000004285,0.00040000000000004285,0.00040000000000004285,0.00040000000000004285,0.20519351379017478,0.00040000000000004285,0.00040000000000004285,0.13695673750866486,0.00040000000000004285,0.00040000000000004285,0.022492466786205496,0.00040000000000004285,0.00040000000000004285,0.00040000000000004285,0.00040000000000004285,0.00040000000000004285,0.00040000000000004285,0.07742890814707767,0.00040000000000004285,0.00040000000000004285,0.00040000000000004285,0.00040000000000004285,0.00040000000000004285,0.00040000000000004285,0.00040000000000004285,0.00040000000000004285,0.00040000000000004285,0.07337934216891301,0.00040000000000004285,0.16058666442693018,0.00040000000000004285,0.00040000000000004285,0.00040000000000004285,0.00040000000000004285,0.00040000000000004285,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

This cake design is especially lovely when you dust the cake with powdered sugar and cinnamon ..............",112,1,0.0011764705882353606,0.26618191858960644,0.0011764705882353606,0.059999999999899654,0.0011764705882353606,0.0011764705882353606,0.0011764705882353606,0.0011764705882353606,0.059999999999998346,0.0011764705882353606,0.0011764705882353606,0.0011764705882353606,0.0011764705882353606,0.0011764705882353606,0.0011764705882353606,0.0011764705882353606,0.0011764705882353606,0.0011764705882353606,0.06000000000000243,0.0011764705882353606,0.0011764705882353606,0.0011764705882353606,0.0011764705882353606,0.0011764705882353606,0.0011764705882353606,0.0637993287430365,0.06008508106300921,0.0011764705882353606,0.0011764705882353606,0.0011764705882353606,0.0011764705882353606,0.0011764705882353606,0.0011764705882353606,0.0011764705882353606,0.0011764705882353606,0.0011764705882353606,0.0011764705882353606,0.0011764705882353606,0.0011764705882353606,0.0011764705882353606,0.0011764705882353606,0.0011764705882353606,0.07197508976003407,0.0011764705882353606,0.0011764705882353606,0.0011764705882353606,0.30854681713852844,0.0011764705882353606,0.0011764705882353606,0.0011764705882353606,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1
55799,3,"Ca n't be beat My husband drinks coffee continuously . Whenever we are in the car , I 'm always after him not to spill his coffee and I constantly have to clean up the inevitable spills . We could never find a good cup that would fit in the cup holder so the spills were always on the floor or in his lap . This cup does spill if it 's tipped over ( I do n't think any cup will ever be completely spill proof ) but it fits in the cup holder and therefore does n't spill as easily . I bought two , one for him and one for me ( I drink ice water and tea ) and they both fit together nicely side - by - side in our cars cup holder . They keep hot drinks hot and cold drinks cold for long periods of time . I have purchased loads of cups over the 34 years of our marriage and this has to be the best by far . I would highly recommend this item for everyone !",186,1,0.2079967042644304,0.0005882352941176817,0.0005882352941176817,0.0005882352941176817,0.0005882352941176817,0.0005882352941176817,0.0005882352941176817,0.0005882352941176817,0.0005882352941176817,0.0005882352941176817,0.0005882352941176817,0.05938176262085495,0.0005882352941176817,0.0005882352941176817,0.0005882352941176817,0.0005882352941176817,0.0005882352941176817,0.0005882352941176817,0.030000000000000176,0.2305808530974228,0.0005882352941176817,0.0005882352941176817,0.0005882352941176817,0.059353995234888955,0.0005882352941176817,0.0005882352941176817,0.0005882352941176817,0.0005882352941176817,0.0005882352941176817,0.0005882352941176817,0.0005882352941176817,0.0005882352941176817,0.060261320317149106,0.0005882352941176817,0.0005882352941176817,0.0005882352941176817,0.0005882352941176817,0.0005882352941176817,0.0005882352941176817,0.0524462392897595,0.0907668970222458,0.02667719582962359,0.1590056205589173,0.0005882352941176817,0.0005882352941176817,0.0005882352941176817,0.0005882352941176817,0.0005882352941176817,0.0005882352941176817,0.0005882352941176817,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

55834,3,"A great set , especially for the price ! I received this set as a wedding present and have loved using it over the past 4 months . I cook several times a week , mostly for husband and myself , and sometimes for guests . This set has been perfect for my needs , and has performed very well . I follow the care directions ( handwashing , no metal utensils ) and the non - stick coating has done very well . I love the glass lids and the cushy handles . The set includes , as pictured , 1- , 2- , and 3-quart covered saucepans , 6-quart covered stockpot , and 8- and 10-inch French skillets . The skillets do n't come with lids , but the two biggest pot lids work well . NOTE : The product descriptions mention an 11-inch saute pan ; this is NOT in my set and is not included according to product features listing or the picture shown . I did feel a need to buy a 12-inch skillet as the one addition to supplement this set .",188,1,0.0005555555555556072,0.10538192844142127,0.0005555555555556072,0.08056273596335793,0.0737946205747476,0.028571772534699908,0.0005555555555556072,0.0005555555555556072,0.0005555555555556072,0.0005555555555556072,0.08610157976440524,0.038753629413415445,0.0005555555555556072,0.0005555555555556072,0.0005555555555556072,0.0005555555555556072,0.0005555555555556072,0.045018919144627606,0.0005555555555556072,0.0005555555555556072,0.0005555555555556072,0.0005555555555556072,0.0005555555555556072,0.0005555555555556072,0.0005555555555556072,0.22088876007632655,0.06008586320356922,0.0005555555555556072,0.0005555555555556072,0.029627461181121747,0.0005555555555556072,0.0005555555555556072,0.0005555555555556072,0.0005555555555556072,0.0005555555555556072,0.0005555555555556072,0.0005555555555556072,0.0005555555555556072,0.0005555555555556072,0.0005555555555556072,0.0005555555555556072,0.0005555555555556072,0.03187079025938086,0.0005555555555556072,0.08334326996876663,0.0005555555555556072,0.0954431139186025,0.0005555555555556072,0.0005555555555556072,0.0005555555555556072,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0
55838,3,"Excellent waffles and easy to clean ! This is a wonderful appliance and at what a savings ! Mine arrived promptly and in "" shipped from the manufacturer "" condition . This is such an improvement over my old waffle maker ( no matter how much I greased it the waffles always stuck).The first time I tried it was on my new son - in - law and I was eager to make a good impression . A red light indicates the appliance is on and a green light tells you when it 's ready to cook . My first waffle came out beautifully and you - know - who ate it with great satisfaction and requested another . Then I screwed up . You see , if you do n't follow directions and forget to rotate the waffle maker your waffle splits in half and ca n't be put back together again ! Third time I did it right . Waffle grids slide out easily for cleaning in the dishwasher . Outside of stainless steel appliance my be cleaned with soap and water or glass cleaner if you prefer . Handle folds down and therefore the appliance stores easily . I was too busy to follow the gram instructions in the recipe booklet accompanying the waffle maker and too busy to beat egg whites separately . So I used my tried and true pancake recipe which turned out great . In the future I 'll be more creative!Highly recommended for waffle lovers",253,1,0.0005714285714286102,0.19750795245113312,0.0005714285714286102,0.0005714285714286102,0.07974109499507653,0.0005714285714286102,0.0005714285714286102,0.0005714285714286102,0.09637895601103613,0.0005714285714286102,0.0005714285714286102,0.08633362669429899,0.24188973307936038,0.0005714285714286102,0.02914224160045459,0.0005714285714286102,0.06520929430990463,0.0005714285714286102,0.0005714285714286102,0.0005714285714286102,0.0005714285714286102,0.0005714285714286102,0.0005714285714286102,0.0005714285714286102,0.0005714285714286102,0.0005714285714286102,0.0005714285714286102,0.0005714285714286102,0.0005714285714286102,0.0005714285714286102,0.0005714285714286102,0.0005714285714286102,0.0005714285714286102,0.0005714285714286102,0.0005714285714286102,0.0005714285714286102,0.0005714285714286102,0.0005714285714286102,0.0005714285714286102,0.0005714285714286102,0.0005714285714286102,0.02972894417563622,0.03298633662288464,0.0005714285714286102,0.0005714285714286102,0.0005714285714286102,0.11822467720307045,0.0005714285714286102,0.0005714285714286102,0.0005714285714286102,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

55849,3,"Your lodge will outlive you The effectiveness of this dutch oven lies in its design which served chuck wagons a century ago and campers today ! Cast Iron is ALWAYS a good value for the money and it 's indestructable ( I 'm still using my mother 's Lodge skillet that she got for a wedding gift in 1954 ) . This dutch oven , designed specifically for the camp or fireplace cook , goes from the fire to the table with ease . It stews and bakes beautifully - get a dutch oven cookbook and learn how to make campfire biscuits as well as those stews and chilis ! Also makes a fabulous wedding , shower , or housewarming gift . Forget expensive wedding registries - buy the bride a lodge dutch oven and skillet . She 'll hand them down to the next generation . Every camper can use this and so can every backyard griller .

55877,3,"works great After reading the reviews , I decided to try these , since I was n't too thrilled with either the cost or quality of the senseo pods . After getting my three sets in the mail , I went to my grocery store , bought the Starbucks Sumatra whole beans , ground them to expresso grind , and went to try the ecopads . I followed the instructions , put the ecopad in the machine ( perfect fit ) , hit the 8 oz button , and wa - la ! I would challenge anyone to tell the difference between the stuff you pay $ 3.50 a cup for at Starbucks . I 'm definately hooked . I ca n't see how other reviewers have had problems with these . They are easy to fill , and fit perfectly in the machine . They are a bit messy to clean up , but its a fair trade off for the awesome coffee and the cost savings over the pods or actually going to starbucks . I would estimate I will get 50 - 60 cups out of a $ 6 store bought bag of coffee . Basically , one heaping teaspoon fills up the ecopad perfectly . Also I would estimate getting hundreds of uses out of each ecopad - they seem very durable . I am looking forward to trying different coffee 's with these . Well worth the tiny investment",244,1,0.2404047529518121,0.0004651162790698059,0.06349718286529789,0.0004651162790698059,0.11309068662534977,0.0004651162790698059,0.0004651162790698059,0.0004651162790698059,0.0004651162790698059,0.0004651162790698059,0.0004651162790698059,0.0004651162790698059,0.0004651162790698059,0.0004651162790698059,0.0004651162790698059,0.0004651162790698059,0.0004651162790698059,0.22958289953022934,0.0004651162790698059,0.025749218976208046,0.0004651162790698059,0.0004651162790698059,0.0004651162790698059,0.0004651162790698059,0.0004651162790698059,0.0004651162790698059,0.0004651162790698059,0.0004651162790698059,0.0004651162790698059,0.06359069531423132,0.0004651162790698059,0.0004651162790698059,0.07421033974416903,0.0004651162790698059,0.0004651162790698059,0.0004651162790698059,0.0004651162790698059,0.0004651162790698059,0.0004651162790698059,0.09969653983826947,0.0004651162790698059,0.0004651162790698059,0.0004651162790698059,0.0004651162790698059,0.07110791671257091,0.0004651162790698059,0.0004651162790698059,0.0004651162790698059,0.0004651162790698059,0.0004651162790698059,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

55882,3,"Great Indoor Grill I have had my grill for a week , we 've cooked lean steaks on it , pork chops , and the other night we cooked hamburgers on it . This is my first indoor grill so when one review mentioned the "" George Foreman "" grill was a bit faster , I was amazed I thought the Delonghi cooked pretty fast ! ! Clean up was really easy and one MUST remember to preheat it . I gather some have not . And as to smoking I have n't had any but then I buy lean meats and put water in the bottom if I think the food will drip a lot of fat . Fat dripping into the large tray in the bottom is what burns and causes the smoke . I 've only used water once , with the hamburgers ( no smoking ) . This really is a great grill and large enough to be more than satisfying ( actual cooking space is 15""x11 "" ) . Ease and comfort of use is amazing .

55944,3,"Very good , but expect some hiccups getting started We needed a small countertop dishwasher for our rec room , and after a few months of use , I can say this one is working out very well . It shipped quickly , with no damage ( the box was pretty tattered , but the packing material and the actual dishwasher were fine ) . It 's large for a countertop device , certainly bigger than most microwaves . Be sure to measure your available space , especially clearance to any cabinets above your installation site . I hit some minor bumps getting it installed . The dishwasher hose nozzle is supposed to connect to your kitchen faucet using a threaded quick - connect coupler included in the box . The coupler is supposed to screw onto the end of the faucet , but the faucet on that sink was a removeable spray handle on a long hose . There 's no way for the included adapter to hook up to this , so I wound up having to install a new faucet ( this is n't as bad as it sounds , as we were planning to replace the old one anyway).I brought the quick connect adapter to the hardware store with me to be sure it would fit the threads on the new faucet . Everything seemed okay in the store , but when I got home and installed the new faucet , I had some trouble . It turns out that the included adapter is n't particularly good quality , and did n't fit the faucet threads tightly enough to stay in place once the water pressure was actually turned on . I blew the hose nozzle off the end of the new faucet a couple of times until I finally went back to the hardware store and picked up an off - the - shelf adapter . Fortunately , it looks like Danby is using all standard - sized parts , so I was able to replace the flaky adapter with a new one that works well for only a couple of dollars . Once I had the thing up and running , it was easy to load and use . The basket is built to hold four full place settings , but I find that with some creative jiggering I can get it to take in any odd collection of dishes , mugs , baby cups , storage containers and what have you . The basket insert is removeable , converting it to an all - glasses tray , which we found useful for party cleanup . The machine really heats the water , so dishes come out clean . Even sticky stuff like melted cheese usually cleans right up . I 've never had to use the heat - boost "" sanitize "" setting . It uses a very small amount of dishwasher soap and rinse fluid , and you want to be careful NOT to add too much . I made the mistake of overfilling the soap holder ( spilled a little too much , figured it would just rinse out , oops ) and wound up flooding my countertop in suds . This has only happened once and there was no damage . Call it a learning experience . I saw in some of the other reviews that the timer knob occasionally wo n't advance when you start running the machine , and this did happen to me once as well after I 'd had it for about two weeks . It has n't recurred since then , either becuase I 've been particularly careful to set the timer in the right start position , or the timer 's "" wearing in . ""Been using it steadily several times a week for a few months now , and after the initial hiccups , it 's been working fine . No complaints , and now I 'm looking for a Danby under - counter mini - refigerator to replace one in the same rec room . I 'd recommend this dishwasher , provided you do n't mind a little effort getting it dialed in",701,1,0.0763203191371645,0.22513168356124788,0.022585613492241117,0.01217765194766193,0.03919817565627669,0.00016393442622952676,0.00016393442622952676,0.00016393442622952676,0.00016393442622952676,0.00016393442622952676,0.00016393442622952676,0.00016393442622952676,0.060982326232139054,0.00016393442622952676,0.01655737704918008,0.00016393442622952676,0.04623739521588398,0.029577011697626176,0.00016393442622952676,0.010969676500060421,0.00016393442622952676,0.00016393442622952676,0.00016393442622952676,0.00016393442622952676,0.00016393442622952676,0.00016393442622952676,0.04915765305956375,0.00016393442622952676,0.00016393442622952676,0.03028471892910375,0.00016393442622952676,0.00016393442622952676,0.06858559477892949,0.00016393442622952676,0.00016393442622952676,0.008651159721437374,0.00016393442622952676,0.00016393442622952676,0.042999775855632805,0.03489447152541405,0.0409262843043365,0.00016393442622952676,0.07353244491209897,0.00016393442622952676,0.03813397113906412,0.00016393442622952676,0.06817866249805164,0.00016393442622952676,0.00016393442622952676,0.00016393442622952676,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0

55975,3,"A solid no - frills toaster oven We celebrated 45 years of marriage and a toaster oven has been a kitchen essential for all of those years . The Cuisinart TOB-50 is number 4 . It 's predecessor lasted for 24 years so it has high standards to meet and I 'm optimistist . We choose it for it 's simplicity , solid feel , and size hoping for reliability and ease of use . In it 's early months it is meeting our expectations . It is one of the most solid and basic that I 've seen on the market . The controls are solid and easy to use . It toasts evenly and you have the ability to control the darkness of the toast easily . My baking use has been limited but it does a good job of heating small portions that you do n't want to microwave . The door and the hinges are solid feeling .

56004,4,"Did we see the same movie ? Every review I 've read about this movie pops and fizzes with praise and I just do n't get it . No one speaks until practically 10 minutes into it , and by then you 're so confused by the random scenes thrown together and the cyrilic letters , it makes it hard to enjoy what comes next . If you like extremely BROAD slapstick humor and find that totally charming , then I guess I can see the appeal . Everyone talks about how this movie spawned so many catch phrases . I have to wonder what they could be : "" Damned Melon ! "" or "" I passed out when I broke my wrist , and when I woke up , the cast was already on ! "" ? ? ? I will say listening to the dubbed english and having the english subtitles on at the same time does add some humor , because they say completely different things , or omit speech altogether .

56007,4,"More "" Lost Cause "" Mythology It 's amazing how Hollywood and the publishing industry have bent their knees to Secession mythology , from Birth of a Nation to the present example of melodramatic falsification . This is a very dull , shapeless , stilted movie . I would n't bother to denounce it on artistic grounds , but since it is above all a piece of propaganda , I 'm compelled to condemn it as history . What it presents is the "" War between the States "" version of the Civil War , in which the gallant Southerners defend their homes , their beloved hills and dales , their cultured lives from the inexplicable invasion of the rude hordes of the North . There are only two Black characters , both sentimentally loyal to their Southernness and their masters ; otherwise , slavery is beside the point . The generalship of Lee and Jackson , of course , is idolized , while the Northern officers above the rank of colonel are portrayed as fools . The battle scenes are perfectly predictable ; guys charge on foot , other guys shoot , the fields are littered with bodies . Would n't a little exposition of the logistics of those battle been more interesting ? How real is it to show only one train , and that Southern , in a war won more by transportation than by musketry ? If you are a believer in the myth of the Lost Cause and the justice of Secession , if you have ever cottoned to the notion that the War was n't really about slavery , then I challenge you honor ! I defy you to read just one heavy , scholarly book , Arguing About Slavery by William Lee Miller , a professor at the University of Virginia . It retells the debates that occurred in the House of Representatives , over slavery , in the 1830s , twenty - five years before the election of Lincoln . The uncompromising sectional hatred expressed in those debates will surely convince you that the Civil War had deeper roots than you thought , and that slavery Was indeed the central issue for both sides , Blue and Grey",376,0,0.0005882352941177006,0.03288087643799464,0.0005882352941177006,0.0005882352941177006,0.0005882352941177006,0.0005882352941177006,0.03535087759138633,0.0005882352941177006,0.03071033569660486,0.0005882352941177006,0.0005882352941177006,0.0005882352941177006,0.0005882352941177006,0.0005882352941177006,0.029022299897357454,0.0005882352941177006,0.05030813348667802,0.0005882352941177006,0.0005882352941177006,0.030000233339915812,0.0005882352941177006,0.15368546809478498,0.0005882352941177006,0.0005882352941177006,0.0005882352941177006,0.0005882352941177006,0.0005882352941177006,0.0005882352941177006,0.0005882352941177006,0.0005882352941177006,0.0005882352941177006,0.20057110276787848,0.0005882352941177006,0.0005882352941177006,0.09697638682234502,0.030144251977579133,0.12590224780099912,0.0005882352941177006,0.0005882352941177006,0.0005882352941177006,0.09783025716709702,0.0005882352941177006,0.0005882352941177006,0.0648528230370241,0.0005882352941177006,0.0005882352941177006,0.0005882352941177006,0.0005882352941177006,0.0005882352941177006,0.0005882352941177006,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
56010,4,"movie reviews crossed : kitty foyle johnny belinda Editorial ReviewsAmazon.com essential videoAfter initially rejecting the role as too sentimental , Ginger Rogers found the title character of Kitty Foyle to be an Oscar winner and a career breakthrough . Released in 1940 , only a year after her nine - picture partnership with Fred Astaire ended , Kitty Foyle helped establish Rogers as a nonmusical box - office star . The film portrays a white - collar working girl who receives a warm and welcome marriage proposal from Mark ( James Craig ) , a kindly but humble doctor . As soon as she accepts , however , she receives a different proposition , this one from her former love , wealthy socialite Wyn ( Dennis Morgan ) , who plans to flee his life and his wife and asks Kitty to join him and live in unwedded bliss in South America . Kitty then recounts her life in flashback to help her choose which man to love . Rogers gives an appealing performance as the feisty yet vulnerable Kitty , who makes up in moxie what she lacks in social status . Did she really deserve the Best Actress Oscar over Bette Davis in The Letter , Joan Fontaine in Rebecca , Katharine Hepburn in The Philadelphia Story , and Martha Scott in Our Town ? Well , evidently Rogers had real - life moxie too . --David Horiuchi Product DescriptionKnown for light comedies and her partnership with Fred Astaire , Ginger Rogers stepped off the dance floor and into 1940 's Oscar spotlight with her Best Actress turn as Kitty , an indomitable working - class girl who endures the rejection of Philadelphia society , makes her own way as a single woman and ultimately chooses between an unmarried arrangement with Main Line scion Wynnewood Strafford VI ( Dennis Morgan ) or marriage to a struggling physician ( James Craig ) . Rogers ' deserved Academy Award confirmed she was more than a dance star - a fact humorously underscored when she returned to the studio and was greeted by staffers and actors in top hats and tails . Jane Wyman won the Best Actress Academy Award for her sensitive portrayal of Belinda , capturing the girl 's affecting isolation , awakening desire to learn and ultimate triumph . Directed by Jean Negulesco and co - starring Lew Ayres , Charles Bickford and Agnes Moorehead ( all four Oscar nominees * for their fine work ) , Johnny Belinda ( nominated for a total 11 Oscars including Best Picture ) blends atmosphere , nuance and high drama into a heartbreaking classi",443,0,0.0003448275862069286,0.0003448275862069286,0.0003448275862069286,0.0003448275862069286,0.0003448275862069286,0.0003448275862069286,0.0003448275862069286,0.24282344802806538,0.0003448275862069286,0.0003448275862069286,0.022907106700577856,0.0003448275862069286,0.0003448275862069286,0.0003448275862069286,0.0003448275862069286,0.0003448275862069286,0.0003448275862069286,0.0003448275862069286,0.0003448275862069286,0.0003448275862069286,0.06692700732181946,0.0003448275862069286,0.0003448275862069286,0.0003448275862069286,0.06005107955625297,0.057150885408710335,0.11457827347610969,0.0003448275862069286,0.0003448275862069286,0.07710979431510591,0.0003448275862069286,0.0003448275862069286,0.0003448275862069286,0.0003448275862069286,0.0003448275862069286,0.03037348054766084,0.0003448275862069286,0.0003448275862069286,0.03448232293306205,0.0003448275862069286,0.0003448275862069286,0.0003448275862069286,0.0003448275862069286,0.245466603336087,0.0003448275862069286,0.03468172251447826,0.0003448275862069286,0.0003448275862069286,0.0003448275862069286,0.0003448275862069286,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0
56011,4,"Is ' ' cringe - worthy ' ' a word ? I 'm surprised by all the praise this movie gets here at Amazon and beyond . There really was n't much here I liked . The soundtrack was the usual "" pap "" you 'd expect from a family friendly movie , though the sets were nice . It seems this movie was just miscast . Mel just does n't do comedy all that well , at least for a lead role . Jame Garner , the reason I bought this seems more like a bystander . And Jodie is Jodie and I never bought for a moment she was her character . Although the cast is a powerhouse ( on paper ) , sadly the chemistry never really works and the jokes are just cornball . An example : There was a sequence when Bret asks his friends ( who are standing behind him ) to whistle to reveal themselves to some bandits he was confronting ; which as it turns out they are unable to do . Instead Jodie and James , blow madly , just like the movie .

56034,4,"You 've Got to be Kidding Me While some movies require that you throw out your disbelief , I had a very hard time doing so with this movie . This movie was just plain stupid . They should have kept this film story in the states . Once everything moves over to Tokyo , the film plummets into inauthenticity the likes of which I have n't seen in a long time . I would have respected the film 1,000 times more had it ended when the main character goes to Japan . So let 's get this straight , Japanese high school students act like American high school students ? Lucas Black 's character is simply told to go to a Japanese high school where he will simply pick up the language and make do ? Everybody speaks English ? His father lives in a tiny apartment yet has a garage that 's about double the size of his apartment?I would have much preferred subtitles and a story that felt , looked and sounded more Japanese . Japanese students are among some of the most polite students you will ever meet . The Japanese culture is steeped and immersed in being respectful , polite and dutiful . Real Japanese high school students would be embarassed by the way their culture was represented here . Actually they probably would n't be embarassed , they would laugh at the film 's poor attempt in showing true or even remotely true Japanese culture . Japanese culture is not steeped in American hiphop and egocentric behavior and it 's a pity so many Americans will see this film and actually think that Japanese students are just like American students . There would be nothing further from the truth . Japanese students do not act , look or sound like what was filmed here . Not by a long shot . Given my dislike of how the Japanese culture was handled in this film , it left me finding the plot irrelevant . The plot was OK but it would have been much better if they had either stuck to a more authentic representation of Japanese culture or kept the story in the states .",371,0,0.00025641025641028146,0.00025641025641028146,0.04741403160161199,0.00025641025641028146,0.00025641025641028146,0.00025641025641028146,0.00025641025641028146,0.00025641025641028146,0.00025641025641028146,0.00025641025641028146,0.00025641025641028146,0.00025641025641028146,0.13412816349912493,0.00025641025641028146,0.00025641025641028146,0.00025641025641028146,0.00025641025641028146,0.00025641025641028146,0.00025641025641028146,0.00025641025641028146,0.16201455983322696,0.00025641025641028146,0.00025641025641028146,0.00025641025641028146,0.00025641025641028146,0.09895472580744531,0.00025641025641028146,0.00025641025641028146,0.01569975771292948,0.00025641025641028146,0.00025641025641028146,0.03998763938999701,0.04604753517108046,0.00025641025641028146,0.03355228955761599,0.013576321280911246,0.00025641025641028146,0.02596394098180858,0.00025641025641028146,0.00025641025641028146,0.00025641025641028146,0.013489327725341616,0.00025641025641028146,0.3425182161590612,0.00025641025641028146,0.0171663117926648,0.00025641025641028146,0.00025641025641028146,0.00025641025641028146,0.00025641025641028146,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0
56035,4,"Downright Abyssmal I 'm making an exception to my usual practice of not reviewing anything on amazon , due to the utter vileness of this movie . I saw it when it came out in theaters and hated it , and then a friend purchased the DVD and convinced me to give it a second chance ... all in all , this movie ended up taking about four hours of my life that I will never get back . The performances are thin and uneven , the plot is inconsistent , and the dialogue sounds like it was pulled from fortune cookies made by the cast of Friends . To be fair , this movie does face several major obstacles . It has the misfortune to depend on the "" acting "" of glorified Ken doll Freddie Prinze , Jr. and the vastly overrated Julia Stiles , and in addition to trying to rise above these challenges , it also attempts to survive the intrusion of Ashton Kutcher . It fails on all counts . I do not hate the whole romantic comedy genre ; nor do I hate the "" teen "" movie sub - genre , under which some would place "" Down to You .

56037,4,"Pretty Revealing This DVD exposes the Ultimate Warrior as 25 % postitive and 75 % negative . I do believe that Jim Hellwig does suffer from narcissm in relation to his ongoing identity crisis . Just another case of a wreslter who could n't seperate himself from the character , and even still till this day as he is retired give speaches to colleges . The only thing that bothers me is that Jim Hellwig was n't involved in this dvd to give his perspective and opinions . He was offered to participate and again offered to make his story heard before and after the fact . Jim Hellwig declined , used it as another opportunity to initiate a lawsuit . This guy did make an impact in the wrestling world , but it was too shortlived . Fans can chalk it up as a cool memory , but unfortunately not one linked with any high level of respect like we can with Flair , Piper , Hogan , and the most respected of all The Undertaker",177,0,0.0007692307692308386,0.0007692307692308386,0.0007692307692308386,0.0007692307692308386,0.0007692307692308386,0.0007692307692308386,0.039230769343261716,0.0007692307692308386,0.0007692307692308386,0.0007692307692308386,0.0007692307692308386,0.0007692307692308386,0.4130333764595985,0.0007692307692308386,0.0007692307692308386,0.0007692307692308386,0.05626714563369291,0.08511433116524623,0.0007692307692308386,0.0007692307692308386,0.0007692307692308386,0.0007692307692308386,0.0007692307692308386,0.0007692307692308386,0.0007692307692308386,0.04396202485283702,0.0007692307692308386,0.0007692307692308386,0.0007692307692308386,0.0007692307692308386,0.0007692307692308386,0.0007692307692308386,0.0007692307692308386,0.0007692307692308386,0.0007692307692308386,0.0007692307692308386,0.0007692307692308386,0.0007692307692308386,0.0007692307692308386,0.0007692307692308386,0.0007692307692308386,0.0007692307692308386,0.0007692307692308386,0.3285461986992068,0.0007692307692308386,0.0007692307692308386,0.0007692307692308386,0.0007692307692308386,0.0007692307692308386,0.0007692307692308386,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

56067,4,"Embarrasing to watch . I have to disagree with the reviews above and say that I watched this movie on dvd having watched it as a kid twenty years ago . Unfortunately I could n't find anything about this film I remember enjoying . It 's a cross between The Blob , The Thing and a really crap detective movie . Moriarty 's character is pretty smooth but the film culminates in a farce reminicent of an 80 's kiddy movie . This film is definetly not for intelligent adults and you 'll lose interest halfway through I guarantee it . No suspense , few laughs , and way to hokey to watch twice . If you love this movie you need to get out more .",127,0,0.0007142857142857567,0.0007142857142857567,0.0007142857142857567,0.0007142857142857567,0.0007142857142857567,0.0007142857142857567,0.0007142857142857567,0.0007142857142857567,0.0007142857142857567,0.0007142857142857567,0.0007142857142857567,0.0007142857142857567,0.0007142857142857567,0.0007142857142857567,0.0007142857142857567,0.0007142857142857567,0.0007142857142857567,0.1241991131832874,0.0007142857142857567,0.0007142857142857567,0.44337584937088403,0.10023897983623183,0.0007142857142857567,0.0007142857142857567,0.0007142857142857567,0.0007142857142857567,0.0007142857142857567,0.0007142857142857567,0.0007142857142857567,0.0007142857142857567,0.0007142857142857567,0.0007142857142857567,0.0007142857142857567,0.0007142857142857567,0.0007142857142857567,0.0007142857142857567,0.0007142857142857567,0.0007142857142857567,0.0007142857142857567,0.0007142857142857567,0.1046449868611106,0.0007142857142857567,0.0007142857142857567,0.19539821360562715,0.0007142857142857567,0.0007142857142857567,0.0007142857142857567,0.0007142857142857567,0.0007142857142857567,0.0007142857142857567,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

He has done such great B - movies as this , Q , and It 's Alive 3 : Island of the Alive . How awesome is he ? ? Anyways , I think that this movie was hilarious ! I think a lot of people take this movie too seriously , thinking that it is going to be your typical movie . But you should n't because not only is this a B - movie , but IT IS supposed to be funny . My favorite part is when "" the stuff "" started bubbeling out of the ground and that old hick guy just starts eating it . Who would do that ? ? I just started laughing by butt off when that happened . So if you watch this movie , just sit back and enjoy it for what it 's worth , do n't be too critical on it . What I learned from The Stuff : Dairy products are evil ! Especially if they come from with in the earth!If you like The Stuff , I recommend : Watching other B - movies , such as Island of the Alive 3 , Zombi 3 and 4 , etc",230,0,0.00047619047619051034,0.00047619047619051034,0.00047619047619051034,0.00047619047619051034,0.00047619047619051034,0.00047619047619051034,0.00047619047619051034,0.00047619047619051034,0.00047619047619051034,0.00047619047619051034,0.00047619047619051034,0.04718077765783732,0.00047619047619051034,0.00047619047619051034,0.00047619047619051034,0.00047619047619051034,0.00047619047619051034,0.00047619047619051034,0.00047619047619051034,0.00047619047619051034,0.6961520689575639,0.00047619047619051034,0.00047619047619051034,0.00047619047619051034,0.00047619047619051034,0.00047619047619051034,0.00047619047619051034,0.00047619047619051034,0.00047619047619051034,0.00047619047619051034,0.00047619047619051034,0.00047619047619051034,0.00047619047619051034,0.00047619047619051034,0.00047619047619051034,0.00047619047619051034,0.00047619047619051034,0.00047619047619051034,0.00047619047619051034,0.00047619047619051034,0.00047619047619051034,0.00047619047619051034,0.00047619047619051034,0.00047619047619051034,0.23428620100364472,0.00047619047619051034,0.00047619047619051034,0.00047619047619051034,0.00047619047619051034,0.00047619047619051034,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

56110,4,"Pul - eese . Why did they have to make this movie ? I have only one question about this movie . And that is , Why in the world did they change so many things that were in the book ? If you have n't read the book than you do n't know what I 'm talking about . But if you have , then you do . I ca n't even begin to explain how good of a movie this would 've been if it had been adapted correctly . Half the time while watching this , I felt as if I was watching Teletubies or something , the colors were so bright . If this movie had been placed in the correct time period with correct costumes , locations , characters , and details from the story , then EVERYONE would love it . Not just 5 year olds . It makes me so angry when I watch this movie . Yes , its funny and charming but it is so embarrassing . Everytime I loan someone the book , I have to explain to them that it is nothing like the movie at all . In fact , it is a hundred times better . More even . I am really disappointed . I just do n't get how Gail Carson Levine would agree to all the changes that were made . If someone ever gets the courage to adapt the book into another movie , than I suggest they do it right . And if they do , then I 'll be very thankful . I just do n't get it . The book is soooooooooooooooooooooooooo much better . You would n't believe how much better it is . I am truely ashamed that this movie is even related in any way to the book .

56137,4,"ugh This is an extremely dry anime . The manga version by Masamune Shirow is filled with bits of humor . Not so for the anime . The character Batou was especially funny in the manga , but , for reasons unknown , he is the driest character in the already humorless anime version . Expect long scenes filled with monotonous talking . These really make the movie crawl . One minute there 's action , next you 're listening to Matoko or Batou go on and on about existentialism . Seriously , these little talks , take up 3/4 of the movie . The visuals are awesome , no question about that . Even so , they do not fulfill the need for SOME kind of thread of a story . Altogether , not much actually , HAPPENS during the movie . If you must see it , rent it first to be sure you want it",158,0,0.0008000000000000447,0.05419066699102152,0.0008000000000000447,0.0008000000000000447,0.0008000000000000447,0.0008000000000000447,0.0008000000000000447,0.0008000000000000447,0.09474316485336873,0.0008000000000000447,0.0008000000000000447,0.0008000000000000447,0.0008000000000000447,0.0008000000000000447,0.0008000000000000447,0.0008000000000000447,0.0008000000000000447,0.0008000000000000447,0.0008000000000000447,0.0008000000000000447,0.2620832685467732,0.5521828996088347,0.0008000000000000447,0.0008000000000000447,0.0008000000000000447,0.0008000000000000447,0.0008000000000000447,0.0008000000000000447,0.0008000000000000447,0.0008000000000000447,0.0008000000000000447,0.0008000000000000447,0.0008000000000000447,0.0008000000000000447,0.0008000000000000447,0.0008000000000000447,0.0008000000000000447,0.0008000000000000447,0.0008000000000000447,0.0008000000000000447,0.0008000000000000447,0.0008000000000000447,0.0008000000000000447,0.0008000000000000447,0.0008000000000000447,0.0008000000000000447,0.0008000000000000447,0.0008000000000000447,0.0008000000000000447,0.0008000000000000447,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
56138,4,"What 's all the fuss about ? Before I review , I 'd like to clear something up : I am a very latecomer in seeing this movie . I was introduced to the Ghost in the Shell franchise through the new Anime series airing on Adult Swim , Ghost in the Shell : Standalone Complex . I absolutely love that show , and so I figured eventually I 'd have to get around to seeing the movie , which I knew full well shares no connection with the show . They 're both seperate interperetations of the comic series of the same name , ( which I have not read , so I do n't know which is more accurate ) but the TV series is exponentially better than this movie in almost every concievable way . There are many things I do n't like about this movie , the biggest being poor pacing . The plot for the movie is actually surprisingly straightforward once you cut away all the filler , but that 's the biggest problem . There 's not really enough story to last a full - length feature , because it seems almost like it was originally written with the intention of being a 30 minute short . And since they did n't have the budget to load the movie up with action scenes ( there are barely any , and they are n't very impressive for the most part ) they had to slow the story down with drawn out conversations that you wo n't understand more than 60 % of , and camera shots that last for what feels like minutes where we 're looking at either nothing , or a woman 's nipples . That 's not cinematic artistry , that 's being either lazy or perverted . The animation itself is n't even that good , especially considering that this is was a theatrical release from only 10 years ago . It 's choppy , and there 's not really a whole lot of detail ( except when it comes to women 's nipples ) . Looking at just the animation , if I did n't know better , I 'd have thought this movie was an OVA from the 1980's . The only thing I can really say I liked about this movie was that it was Ghost in the Shell . It 's probably kind of like how I did n't see the 1989 Batman movie until years after I 'd been spoiled by Batman the Animated Series , and could n't bring myself to like it for any reason other than that it was Batman . Everything about the TV series is superior to this movie : the animation , the stories , the character developement , the production values ... I could go on for an entire page about how much better the TV series is . In short , if you 're you 're at all interested in the GITS franchise , do yourself a favor and rent the DVDs of the TV show instead . You 'll find a lot to love , but I ca n't say the same about the movie . My dream is that someday Alex Proyas will give us a GITS movie that lives up to what I would hope for after watching Standalone Complex",565,0,0.00019230769230771142,0.00019230769230771142,0.00019230769230771142,0.00019230769230771142,0.00019230769230771142,0.00019230769230771142,0.00019230769230771142,0.00019230769230771142,0.00019230769230771142,0.00019230769230771142,0.00019230769230771142,0.00019230769230771142,0.00019230769230771142,0.00019230769230771142,0.00019230769230771142,0.00019230769230771142,0.00019230769230771142,0.00019230769230771142,0.01942195389346062,0.00019230769230771142,0.4472164524165833,0.20264066308606118,0.011484896905220419,0.11786437426184188,0.00019230769230771142,0.024349163368362455,0.00019230769230771142,0.00019230769230771142,0.00019230769230771142,0.014952166279952266,0.00019230769230771142,0.00019230769230771142,0.00019230769230771142,0.00019230769230771142,0.04755928191864803,0.00019230769230771142,0.039054089851356076,0.00019230769230771142,0.00019230769230771142,0.00019230769230771142,0.03950307804043979,0.00019230769230771142,0.00019230769230771142,0.00019230769230771142,0.028453879978073256,0.00019230769230771142,0.00019230769230771142,0.00019230769230771142,0.00019230769230771142,0.00019230769230771142,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

56155,4,"No Habeas , not much Corpus , and definitely not Delictus I hate lawyers . What is a lawyer , anyway ? Basically : it 's a telemarketer in a decent suit , a guy who would be hawking the latest Ronco Hair - in - a - Can super - duper late night special to folks in Akron over his plantronic headset , only he won the genetic lottery and got shot out of an upper - middle class womb . Shakespeare said it first and best : "" First , let 's kill all the lawyers ! "" . Former Enron uber - dealmaker John Wing put a little fast - times Houston spin on that one : "" get all the lawyers in a room --- and shoot ' em!---in the mouth , so you * ca n't * miss ! "" Exactly . Anyway , "" The Firm "" is a flick that purports to make the world of high - priced yappers jaw - rippingly exciting , so I was probably all amped up to despise it . But not really : back before I dug into a gig with the Dark Side in high finance , back when I was hefting a backpack over the sodden campus of my old alma mater , I briefly considered going into law : briefly , for about an hour . It was a desperate time , and I needed money . Why did I consider walking Hell 's Highway , if only for an instant ? Because John Grisham , boring lawyer - turned - ripping - potboiler - writer - turned - back - into - boring - lawyer , a kind of Tom Clancy for the paper - pusher and green - eyeshade set , made it all sound pretty damned funky ( and lucrative ! Hey , dig that BMW 7 series , baby , beep beep ! ) in his engrossing little novel "" The Firm "" : granted , I 've read better prose on the backs of cereal boxes , but it held my attention . I mean , seriously : you 're 19 , and the whole flying out on the corporate Lear to Grand Cayman and switching out briefcases full of cash sounds kinda cool . And strippers , man , plenty of strippers . Oh , and did someone mention a BMW?What 's the difference between a lawyer and a snake ? The snake at least has the decency to hiss before it sinks its fangs into your a * * . Now it 's true : Grisham writes like Kim Jong Il sings , but --- in "" The Firm "" , anyway --- he was a master craftsman at moving things along at a bristling pace , from the pedestrian --- hotshot Law School whiz kid gets picked up by a Memphis white - shoe law firm --- to the Pretty Damned Atrocious , all while keeping the pressure ratcheted up with a dense , suffocating sense of malice . Grisham , like Michael Crichton , is n't a prose genius : he 's not even mediocre . But he writes for film , and "" The Firm "" cried out for cinematic treatment . So it 's baffling that , with all the right Stuff --- Tom Cruise as winsome lead Mitch McDeere , Gene Hackman doing his chain - drinking Gene Hackman thang as the corrupt ( but ultimately worn - out and pathetic ) senior partner , and Sydney Pollack helming it up --- that the big - screen treatment of "" The Firm "" is such a yawner . Talk about contempt of court . Pollack takes all that intricately woven little Grisham - plot and barfs big ugly chunks of it up on the screen . At its guts , really , "" The Firm "" was really nothing more than the Big Career Nightmare : I 've bet the farm on this gig , I 'm getting big money , I 'm working like a fiend , my wife is having trouble remembering my name , and evidently I 'm not doing tax - deals for loaded clients --- I'm doing money laundering for The Mob . Pollack just mangles the whole thing , convolutes the simple , and renders up a flick that will have you checking your watch and yawning . Casting is part of the problem : Cruise does his thing , running around Memphis with his briefcase . Hackman drinks a lot and exudes pure Armani - clad sleaze : "" The Firm "" is all funny - wrinkles when he 's onscreen , but hey , a man can only do so much . Jeanne Tripplehorn ( Cruise 's squeeze ) , who plays Lara San Giacomo when she 's not playing Tripplehorn ( seriously , google the two of 'em : astounding ! ) is a bitter old battleaxe who made me want to stick forks in my eyes . Wilford Brimley is just plain wrong as The Firm 's security chief : too bald , too cracker , too rotund , too silly , too low - end , to do the role justice . Holly Hunter is even worse : Hunter is one of those eighties thangs who got pumped up as Something Sexy , which is baffling , given that she 's about 3'8 , and has all the sex appeal of an Oompah - Loompah . It does n't help that she 's a big , ugly Southern stereotype , the caricature most denizens of dumpy Michigan towns imagine Southerners to be . You want her to die : she does n't . Pollack wants us to think she 's clever and funny . She is n't . Ed Harris , I think , is in this movie . So is Hal Holbrook , which kinda ruins everything , because everytime Hal Holbrook is in a movie you know you 're dealing with a bunch of friggin ' crooks . Anyway , the coup de grace to the stupidity is the entrance , Deus Ex Machina , of Paul Sorvino ( Don Morolto --- what kind of Goombah name is dat , anyway ? Somebody call Tony Soprano ! ) , who takes this juggernaut of boredom from the merely stupid to the totally ridiculous . If you wanna see Tom Cruise running around Memphis with his briefcase for two hours , by all means belly up to the bar . Otherwise , case dismissed .

56157,4,"Confusing , too many characters , difficult to follow story line Simply put : the movie is boring . Clich � upon clich � is confirmed and story lines never come together .

56169,4,"contrived , implausible crime drama "" Four Brothers "" is yet another nail in the coffin of John Singleton 's increasingly moribund moviemaking career . The director - who burst upon the scene in 1991 with the vibrant and gritty "" Boyz n the Hood "" - has here mounted a film so burdened by implausibility and contrivance that it makes one wonder if the once - promising filmmaker will ever be able to get back on track again . The story , reeking of artificiality , features Mark Wahlberg , Tyrese Gibson , Andre Benjamin and Garrett Hedlund as four troubled young men raised by the same foster mother . When she is killed in a convenience store robbery , the quartet launches into action , seeking revenge against the perpetrators and becoming slowly convinced , through their investigation in the neighborhood , that the killing might not have been as random in nature as they had been initially led to believe . The main weakness of this film is that it gives us virtually no reason to care about any of the characters . By not showing us any scenes between the boys and their foster mother ( except for one embarrassingly bad Thanksgiving dinner fantasy sequence that looks as if it were conceived by a first - year film student ) , we are forced to take their relationship totally on faith , rendering the boys ' thirst for revenge arbitrary at worst and academic at best . The acting is uniformly flat , with the characters little more than wafer - thin stereotypes , and even the action scenes come across as surprisingly mundane and second - rate given the Singleton pedigree in this area . The boys ' running around from venue to venue in their Detroit neighborhood , brandishing guns in full view of the populace and screaming for information about their mother 's killer , is ludicrous on the face of it and often reduces the film to the level of cheap low comedy burlesque . With nary a single moment that rings believable or true , "" Four Brothers "" is by - the - book filmmaking from a director who has proven that he has the wherewithal and talent to do so much more .",384,0,0.00038461538461542993,0.00038461538461542993,0.00038461538461542993,0.00038461538461542993,0.00038461538461542993,0.00038461538461542993,0.00038461538461542993,0.15554712735904816,0.00038461538461542993,0.00038461538461542993,0.00038461538461542993,0.00038461538461542993,0.00038461538461542993,0.00038461538461542993,0.019615384603043497,0.00038461538461542993,0.00038461538461542993,0.00038461538461542993,0.00038461538461542993,0.00038461538461542993,0.11299396963738745,0.08213926765624441,0.00038461538461542993,0.00038461538461542993,0.00038461538461542993,0.00038461538461542993,0.022405731119074235,0.00038461538461542993,0.00038461538461542993,0.00038461538461542993,0.00038461538461542993,0.00038461538461542993,0.05821840583175079,0.00038461538461542993,0.00038461538461542993,0.00038461538461542993,0.06334370556722427,0.00038461538461542993,0.00038461538461542993,0.03566008274310256,0.00038461538461542993,0.05807692307696269,0.00038461538461542993,0.37661478702154466,0.00038461538461542993,0.00038461538461542993,0.00038461538461542993,0.00038461538461542993,0.00038461538461542993,0.00038461538461542993,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

56177,4,"Not too good for kids Denise Austin needs to stick with making exercise videos for adults . This video is n't kid friendly , and does n't have a good feel for kids . To be honest , it is very close to most of Denise 's exercise videos for adults . What Denise has forgotten , or may have never known , is kids are kids , and they need to be treated accordingly , and that means with exercise videos to . A good choice for kids is - Kick to Get Fit Jr. -For Kids , this video is done by a qualified kid 's fitness professional , not someone who is just throwing adult type movements at kids , and just hoping they can do them . My kids are NOT at all happy with this program . There are 6 10 years old , and they were bored turned off by this video within the first 5 minutes , mostly because they did n't understand the movements , and then found most of the other movements very hard to do . Once again , the forgotten point - Kids are kids , and they need to be treated accordingly . One last point , in the video Denise mentions that she received information from a variety of different professionals in the field of children 's exercise fitness . This is all good except they all forgot one VERY IMPORTANT DETAIL,- You MUST be able to teach instruct children at a level they understand . Just because you know something about exercise , it does n't mean you are able to teach it to children . Knowledge is one thing - Teaching Instructing is another , and the fact is , some people are just not very good at instructing children .

56191,4,"Does not hold our attention Let me start off by saying that I have higher degrees in art , art history , music , and Romance languages -- so I am an admitted "" art snob . "" Having said that , I would recommend that you try the Baby Einstein "" Baby Van Gogh , World of Colors "" and "" Baby Mozart "" videos instead of this Brainy Baby video . I find this Brainy Baby video to be slow , boring , insipid , condescending , and visually uninteresting ; I can not wait to put in something else . Wait , you say , is n't this about the baby who is watching it ? Well , I first realized that it is truly boring ( and not "" just me "" ) by watching my 6-month - old 's reaction to it . ( She is now 10 months old , and still does not like it . ) She consistently snubbed her nose at this video ; she did not watch it for more than a few seconds at a time and always turned away to find something more interesting to do . She has never had this reaction to the Einstein videos I mentioned . I tried reintroducing this video every few weeks since she was 6 months old , thinking maybe she would grow to understand it better , but after 4 months of this approach , she still is not interested . However , the Einstein videos have captivated her from the beginning , and still do . Here are the specifics that I think are the problem . The visuals are weak and not bold / colorful enough . My daughter is bored by watching the other babies play with toys . The female voice - over is distracting and annoying , rather than engaging and instructional as intended . The flow is not as coherent as the Einstein videos , which are broken into little themes that make sense in each video . There is no charm or sense of humor , like the Einstein videos . No , I do not have any connection whatsoever to the Baby Einstein folks . I 'm just saying that the Brainy Baby videos seem less professional and are not as engaging . If you 're going to spend the money and spend your time watching a video with your baby , buy one that you and the baby will enjoy together",420,0,0.13415294305218906,0.0002777777777778074,0.0002777777777778074,0.022973552651153348,0.0002777777777778074,0.0002777777777778074,0.0002777777777778074,0.0002777777777778074,0.0002777777777778074,0.0002777777777778074,0.0002777777777778074,0.021789976906209933,0.05953991400642947,0.0002777777777778074,0.0002777777777778074,0.0002777777777778074,0.0002777777777778074,0.01867022211345959,0.0002777777777778074,0.0002777777777778074,0.38748023170301393,0.0002777777777778074,0.0002777777777778074,0.03392316989143782,0.0002777777777778074,0.0002777777777778074,0.0002777777777778074,0.0002777777777778074,0.0002777777777778074,0.0002777777777778074,0.0002777777777778074,0.017119672787702017,0.0002777777777778074,0.0002777777777778074,0.0002777777777778074,0.0002777777777778074,0.0002777777777778074,0.0002777777777778074,0.0002777777777778074,0.021686483648468483,0.0002777777777778074,0.0002777777777778074,0.08193428993065692,0.0002777777777778074,0.0002777777777778074,0.1898962099759451,0.0002777777777778074,0.0002777777777778074,0.0002777777777778074,0.0002777777777778074,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
56198,4,"bad baby , bad ! Okay , it 's not high art but this film has something to say all be it in a round about fashion . It does make the viewer wonder about modern medicine and how it can possibly affect those who take it on a regular basis . On the other hand , the film lacks true suspense . I was hoping for an explosive opening scene when the baby is first born and instead was offered a yawn . The baby itself is about as scary as fozzy bear and while there is some blood flow it is kept to a minimum . The pacing is too slow at times and it just does n't stand up that well today . The actors who took part in this did n't go anywhere say for the father who went on to appear in the sequel . Why there was a sequel is beyond me . I recall how frightening the commercial was for this film when it first came out but I was only five at the time . At the most this is a rent not a buy .

56199,4,"Aims low and hits its target This straight - to - video 's modest budget is attested to by the fact that while most of the action is supposed to take place at a large state prison , this prison only seems to house about 12 inmates . The plot is that old but reliable one about a man posing as a prisoner so he can go "" undercover "" and solve a crime . The crime in this case is not especially interesting and it 's resolved in much too pat a fashion . However , leading man Tommy Lee Thomas looks good with his shirt off , ( though he seems too small to be throwing his weight around ) , and there 's a torture scene , ( modeled on the one in "" Lethal Weapon "" ) , in which he 's hanged by his wrists and zapped with electric shocks .

56203,4,"Simpsons Go PC on DVD I 've been waiting for this season , literally , for years . It contained ( notice the past tense ) the funniest scene ever in the entire run of the show . It was in the emergency clinic in the episode "" My Sister , My Sitter "" where the scene pans around showing the patients . Smithers appears holding an empty gerbil cage and is the only patient not sitting down . When I first saw that , many years ago , I literally rolled off of the couch with laughter as my wife stared at me like I needed a padded room . She did n't even understand the joke when I explained it as an alternate lifestyle practice of "" hiding "" the rodent so as to make sitting down more than a little uncomfortable . This DVD cut has been cut and makes Smithers reply about not letting Lisa ahead of him make no sense . One of my favorite things about the Simpsons was that they did n't care who they offended .

56205,4,"The Character of Martha Dunstock Rather than give another general review as others have kindly done , my review focuses on one aspect of the film , indeed one character , that of Martha . Martha Dunstock is known throughout the film as Martha Dumptruck . Even the film credits include the nickname ` Dumptruck ' besides the character 's surname ( evidently feeling the need to labour the point ) . Portrayed as unattractive and pathetically grateful for any attention she is given , she unwittingly provides the Slater character with information enabling him to murder a student . Later , when the cult status of the ` suicides ' ( that is , murdered students ) becomes apparent , Martha attempts her own suicide by walking into the path of traffic . But her attempt is shown as a failure . At the end of the film Martha is bruised and now disabled , in an electric wheelchair . Ryder 's character , having finished her voyage of self - realisation , rejects the school Prom night and instead invites Martha to stay in with a video and popcorn . Martha gratefully accepts and the closing scenes show Ryder walking along the corridor while Martha encircles her like a planet around the sun . The image of Martha in her wheelchair , an object of pity for Ryder and for the audience , signifies to us fears of being different , of not being beautiful , of not being loved and respected . Martha is the person we are all frightened of becoming . She is given no means of solving her predicament by the film maker . And though some of us in the audience may be fat , or disabled , or both , we may yet still fear Martha , and are invited to consider Ryder 's protagonist 's journey of self discovery as our own , even is in physical and social reality , we are more like Martha . For this reason , ` Heathers ' fails as an exploration of the ` Hell ' of High School ( a description often used by Buffy / Angel/ Firefly 's Joss Whedon ) . Those in the audience NOT as thin and complying with Western standards of ` beauty ' as the protagonists ( probably the majority of us ) ultimately may find the so - called subversion of cruel hierarchy in this film just that little too shallow , leaving a bitter after - taste . The way ` fat ' people are portrayed in films such as these unfortunately often reflect the predictable , transparent and absurd fixations of the film makers .

56215,4,"If I want to see a boring and pointless dream sequence I 'll rewatch Dallas Roger Ebert , a review I greatly respect and normally agree with , raved about this flick . Roger , I love you , but you missed the boat on this one . I'm not going to review the plot because it 's been done by several reviewers already . Suffice it to say , David Lynch did n't get enough of symbolism interpretation in freshman English ( "" Okay , class , who wants to discuss the meaning of the impaled pig 's head on page 72 in Lord of the Flies ? David , how about you ? "" ) and now want to inflict it on you , the unwitting movie watching public . Thanks , Mr. Lynch , but I 'll pass . I did n't enjoy figuring out the obscure symbolism in page after page of Crime and Punishment and I did n't enjoy it in scene after scene of Mulholland Drive . To add insult to injury , Lynch prides himself on putting scenes in his movie that make absolutely no sense , rationalizing it by saying life often does n't make sense . This habit of his is less noticible in this film than , say , Twin Peaks , mostly because the whole film is for the most part senseless . Yeah , it 's true that a lot of things are absurd in my own life , but more along the lines of "" ... I would 've won Powerball this week except I spent my lottery money on a scented candle at the RenFaire , what the heck was I thinking ... "" or "" ... I wasted 2 1/2 hours of my life watching this dumb movie , what the heck was I thinking ... "" but I 've yet to be visited by scrawny cowboy or a wheelchaired dwarf . I must live a sheltered life or something . Lynch also forbids chapter cuts in his DVD , believing his movie must be watched in its entirety , or not at all ( I 'd advise the second . ) To be fair , in this case I do n't think he 's motivated entirely by a exaggerated sense of importance , but rather by the knowledge that every male , if given the chance , would overshoot most of the movie and focus on the hot chick on chick action . C'mon all you 5 star givers , admit it ! You find the movie pretentious and silly , but the topless scenes more than make up for all the drippy pseudo - art ! To reiterate , if I wanted to see a boring and pointless dream sequence I 'll rewatch Dallas - if I wanted to see a nice rack I 'll take my top off and look in the mirror .

"" If only the makers of this film could have been so concise at some point in the first reel or two of their documentary as to what it is they were trying to say . Instead , from the start , The Big Buy feels like a film you 've walked into thirty minutes late . Following the theme stated by Earle of cops and robbers , The Big Buy is supposed to have a film noir aesthetic , but the intended use of light and shadow is so intermittent you likely wo n't notice . Somewhere in this mess is a good film and a better story , to bad it 's not being told here .",193,0,0.20845286282648975,0.0005555555555556103,0.0005555555555556103,0.07992063196154732,0.0005555555555556103,0.0005555555555556103,0.0005555555555556103,0.0005555555555556103,0.0005555555555556103,0.0005555555555556103,0.0005555555555556103,0.0005555555555556103,0.061873469959729116,0.0005555555555556103,0.0005555555555556103,0.0005555555555556103,0.0005555555555556103,0.0903560898271437,0.028328235121536836,0.0005555555555556103,0.0005555555555556103,0.08562392441088716,0.0005555555555556103,0.0005555555555556103,0.0005555555555556103,0.0005555555555556103,0.0005555555555556103,0.0005555555555556103,0.0005555555555556103,0.0876198855613845,0.0005555555555556103,0.0005555555555556103,0.0005555555555556103,0.0005555555555556103,0.0005555555555556103,0.0005555555555556103,0.0005555555555556103,0.0005555555555556103,0.0005555555555556103,0.0005555555555556103,0.0005555555555556103,0.0005555555555556103,0.0005555555555556103,0.26606659956684936,0.0005555555555556103,0.045700885435780714,0.023835193106426983,0.0005555555555556103,0.0005555555555556103,0.0005555555555556103,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0

Dude , I have never seen anything so gay in my whole life ( except the director 's other film Speed Demon ) . When the guys were less clothes than the gals , that s not a good sign . The video shelves at a local corporate video rental store carry tons of this director 's work . They're all filled with loads of homoeroticism . Women are ugly and they were single piece bathing suits whilst the guys wear banana hammocks . The ' roided up leeches enter their "" male "" victims through anal orrifices . After watching about a half hour of this mess I had to turn it off . Why does this guy fool people into renting these movies . I do n't mind gay subtext in films but when it takes over the film and hits you over the head with it then it 's time to draw the line . No hetro relationships in this one .

56241,4,"Good but about 10 years too late I have been a long - time radiohead fan and , like many others , have been waiting patiently for a live DVD . So I was thrilled to find out they released one and immediately bought it without even looking at the setlist . It never occurred to me that they would release material that is nearly 10 years old ! I could n't help being disappointed when I watched this DVD . The constantly changing camera angles and general lack of concern for the song itself make this unpleasant to watch . In fact , I only watched it once and it has since been gathering dust . I know I would have enjoyed it much more had it come out when the songs were still in their prime . I 've always that Radiohead was modern , progressive , and totally innovative . I appreciate their old music but they have come a long way since pablo honey ... and it does n't help that before every song , Thom mutters "" this is a new one .

56258,4,"Poorly done mocumentary 24-Hour Party People is a mocumentary at the lowest rung ( if Best In Show was not enough ) that tries at many times to be funny but is mostly in poor taste . The British scene in the 1980 's was influential and at the height of the 2nd Brit wave , and Michael Winterbottom could have exposed the goings - on in a much better way . My main issue with this film was it 's attempts at being funny in a hip - Britster fashion that falls flat constantly since the issues occurring are very serious . The dialogue is difficult to follow especially since most of it is meaningless anyway , and the film never really follows it 's premise as much as it should : the rise of Factory . I did really enjoy the Joy Division segments , though , even if exploiting Ian Curtis 's death was slightly in poor taste . Unless you 're a fan of the Brit explosion of the post - punk era , and an extreme fan at that , I could not recommend this film . It 's not even greatly educational for music lovers and at times very difficult to get into .",210,0,0.0006451612903226403,0.0006451612903226403,0.1241134764332357,0.0006451612903226403,0.0006451612903226403,0.0006451612903226403,0.0006451612903226403,0.0006451612903226403,0.0006451612903226403,0.0006451612903226403,0.0006451612903226403,0.0006451612903226403,0.0006451612903226403,0.0006451612903226403,0.0006451612903226403,0.0006451612903226403,0.0006451612903226403,0.0006451612903226403,0.0006451612903226403,0.0006451612903226403,0.2698198720298045,0.08818992170411429,0.0006451612903226403,0.06640910420234848,0.0006451612903226403,0.0006451612903226403,0.0006451612903226403,0.0006451612903226403,0.0006451612903226403,0.0006451612903226403,0.0006451612903226403,0.0006451612903226403,0.0006451612903226403,0.0006451612903226403,0.0006451612903226403,0.0006451612903226403,0.0006451612903226403,0.0006451612903226403,0.0006451612903226403,0.0006451612903226403,0.0006451612903226403,0.0006451612903226403,0.0006451612903226403,0.4224353675659784,0.0006451612903226403,0.0006451612903226403,0.0006451612903226403,0.0006451612903226403,0.0006451612903226403,0.0006451612903226403,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
56264,4,"Out of Sync Tommy I 've been a fan of the Who since I recieved my copy of Tommy on vinyl in 1970 for Christmas . I resisted buying this DVD set for a long time because of the price and knowing that if it was a current release that Townshend would be playing an accoustic guitar while someone backstage would be playing what he should be ( he started doing this due to hearing loss years ago ) . The Who has nt been the same since . Watching the Tommy performance will make you seasick its so out of sync . It just goes to show that some publishers and performers will let anything out the door to make another buck . I had just moved to Las Vegas when Entwhistle died there of a cocaine overdose , it was somehow prophetic in a way , I did nt have tickets for their show that week but I thought with his death it would nt have happened anyway . Surprisingly it did , ( its all about $ $ $ $ $ ) .If you 've never seen this band in its heyday go get a copy of their Live at the Isle of Wight festival show or Woodstock for a second choice and see what this band was really like . And shame on the people who let this recording hit the shelves , I hope they choke on the money .",245,0,0.0004545454545455119,0.0004545454545455119,0.0004545454545455119,0.0352183957562495,0.0004545454545455119,0.07416063980031859,0.0004545454545455119,0.07553568143465754,0.0004545454545455119,0.0004545454545455119,0.0004545454545455119,0.0004545454545455119,0.43237015690188474,0.0004545454545455119,0.023181818181818935,0.0004545454545455119,0.0004545454545455119,0.03315444061209755,0.0004545454545455119,0.0004545454545455119,0.0004545454545455119,0.0004545454545455119,0.0004545454545455119,0.03798054296415302,0.05558119479651978,0.024130448222499424,0.0004545454545455119,0.0004545454545455119,0.0004545454545455119,0.0004545454545455119,0.0004545454545455119,0.0004545454545455119,0.0004545454545455119,0.0004545454545455119,0.0004545454545455119,0.0004545454545455119,0.0004545454545455119,0.0004545454545455119,0.0004545454545455119,0.021075493611957628,0.16988391499056824,0.0004545454545455119,0.0004545454545455119,0.0004545454545455119,0.0004545454545455119,0.0004545454545455119,0.0004545454545455119,0.0004545454545455119,0.0004545454545455119,0.0004545454545455119,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

56290,4,"Nothing to write home about I picked this set up despite reservations ( reservations being Luke Perry and the guy from the Cosby Show ) because of the creator J. Michael Straczynski . Unfortunately the show is just not up to snuff . It 's really nothing more then a C average show . Normally that 's not a big deal but when you consider this is on a premium channel ( Showtime ) and costs over $ 70.00 on DVD it 's just not good enough . Specific problems I had with the show include a lot of filler episodes . The season is only 18 episodes long and at least half are stand alones that contribute nothing to the overall story line . The show would have been better off with only 12 episodes all geared towards a single over riding story ( this is the model that HBO uses ) . Production value is also sorely lacking . Once again I 'm going to compare to HBO ( I feel this is fair since these are both pay to view networks ) . The HBO series Carnivale has unbelievable production value , the set 's , locations , costumes and visual effects are all motion picture quality ( the same can be said for Deadwood and Rome but Carnival makes for a better comparison ) . But Jeremiah all looks the same . You can tell the show was all shot in the same location , every back road and town look like they are in the same county . The biggest problem however is just the premise . A post genocidal virus world populated by orphaned children seems like a good idea but in practice it get 's tired fast . I had to force myself through the last 9 episodes . Luke Perry 's quest to find Valhalla sector fails to add any intrigue or mystery . Simon 's quest to rebuild civilization also comes up flat and any moral or social lessons conveyed are thinly veiled . So basically it is neither exciting nor intelligent . Plus if you need any other reason to dislike this show then know that Jason Presley makes a guest appearance ( just what this show needed a 90210 reunion).If you 're looking for a great show this is not it . If you can watch it cheap give a whirl but do n't waste any hard earned cash on this one",413,0,0.2335266843418193,0.0002777777777778168,0.0261866554664933,0.01825666627283055,0.03754851435423131,0.0002777777777778168,0.016107925745128975,0.0002777777777778168,0.030777157902925734,0.0002777777777778168,0.0002777777777778168,0.0002777777777778168,0.0002777777777778168,0.0002777777777778168,0.014166666570549612,0.0002777777777778168,0.09787261229687633,0.022858273000572842,0.0002777777777778168,0.0002777777777778168,0.0002777777777778168,0.10600231252527183,0.0002777777777778168,0.021941721982667504,0.0002777777777778168,0.044145192018863716,0.0002777777777778168,0.0002777777777778168,0.0002777777777778168,0.04161111313240648,0.0002777777777778168,0.0002777777777778168,0.08983438795429542,0.0002777777777778168,0.07687074600095041,0.018540172420681154,0.0002777777777778168,0.0002777777777778168,0.0002777777777778168,0.018476496386898834,0.0002777777777778168,0.0002777777777778168,0.02353981379346051,0.0002777777777778168,0.05312577672196392,0.0002777777777778168,0.0002777777777778168,0.0002777777777778168,0.0002777777777778168,0.0002777777777778168,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

56320,4,"Day of the Suck Francisco was right , this film is about as well - conceived as buttcrust . The review on the back of the dvd says "" jaw dropping , "" but the full quote probably reads "" jaw dropping ( because i was lulled to sleep like a baby ) "" . There is about 30 seconds of truly jaw dropping footage , in the zombie attack scenes , but these scenes only account for maybe 5 minutes of the movie . The rest of this film consists of the ear - bleeding whines and yawn - inducing infighting of the human characters , ill - conceived and extremely unlikable caricatures of a pseudo - cynical and extremely redundant "" evil side of human nature "" message that would be better left to Jean Renoir ( or even Adam Sandler considering the results here ) . I do n't watch zombie movies for the characters , especially characters so vapid and unengaging . It seemed like the script writer read a novice 's How To pamphlet and said "" yeah , it needs some CONFLICT "" . If these characters were n't so constipated and bloated I 'd give them a chance . One Amazon reviewer tries to justify all of the one - dimensional absurdity by crowning it with the weighty title of "" social commentary , "" but that 's just a mindless knee - jerk observation that fails to ascertain whether it was carried out sucessfully . It was n't . You 'd get more insight watching a kid frying ants with a magnifying glass . The critical ambitions of this movie are ill - fitting and embarassing , and ultimately just plain disappointing since they allot almost no time to showcase the director 's real talent , which is ( you guessed it ) the lovely undead . The rest is monotonous dreck . I do n't know why horror directors have so much insecurity about the worth of their strengths that they feel they need to shroud them in a poor man 's dramatic rags . All that aside , the ending is the worst anticlimatic cop - out in the history of horror movies . A horror movie that sucks for 3/4 of its duration needs a cool climax to redeem itself , but the cut - away at the end makes you wanna kick the director in the gonads . Sorry , but anyone who calls this a classic is a friggin soundbite - repeating moron .",427,0,0.0002857142857143135,0.0002857142857143135,0.0002857142857143135,0.0002857142857143135,0.0002857142857143135,0.0002857142857143135,0.014793990670756792,0.04229999716257528,0.0002857142857143135,0.0002857142857143135,0.0002857142857143135,0.0002857142857143135,0.0002857142857143135,0.0002857142857143135,0.0002857142857143135,0.0002857142857143135,0.060054334327218094,0.030484204840896312,0.028852540240383192,0.0002857142857143135,0.35387020640207456,0.0002857142857143135,0.0002857142857143135,0.0002857142857143135,0.0002857142857143135,0.0002857142857143135,0.0002857142857143135,0.0002857142857143135,0.0002857142857143135,0.0002857142857143135,0.0002857142857143135,0.013966455568590068,0.0002857142857143135,0.0002857142857143135,0.0002857142857143135,0.0002857142857143135,0.021989091242532077,0.0002857142857143135,0.0002857142857143135,0.0002857142857143135,0.0002857142857143135,0.0002857142857143135,0.0002857142857143135,0.38855002705027225,0.03371058106612906,0.0002857142857143135,0.0002857142857143135,0.0002857142857143135,0.0002857142857143135,0.0002857142857143135,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0

56326,4,"If you care about "" The BOYS "" get the UK set It is a shame that American film classics ( like L and H ) get more attention and love outside of the US than in it . I just bought the Universal Laurel and Hardy 21 Volume Box set which is only available in Europe from Amazon UK ( region 2 ) . This set is EVERYTHING people are saying it is . It is a complete film history of the boys which starts with the boys early silent films ( some solo efferts ) and goes though the Hal Roach Features . All the prints are restored and of pristine quality . A truly beautiful set and a worthy tribute to the boys . There are some missing films ( I assume for copyright reasons ) such as Babes in Toyland , The Devils Brother , Bonnie Scotland and Flying Deuces . To acomadate these DVDs I bought a region free DVD player off Amazon , which is the only way to go if you really want to collect . The DVD player was very cheap . plays beautfully and is well worth the investment . As a side note if you have a region free player all the DVDs in the Universal Box set are also availble as single dics , in case you do n't want to spend all the money at once or just want a few of the films . If you love Laurel and Hardy this is the only way to go ! Anything to screw Hallmark and the corperate monster ! !

56331,4,"Alec Baldwin Could 've Been Hard - Boiled But Ends Up Soggy I remember going to great lengths to fit a matin e showing of HEAVEN 'S PRISONERS into a busy Saturday afternoon during its 1996 theatrical release . Considering the source material and the talent behind and in front of the camera , our little filmgoing party of detective - film fans and Alec Baldwin groupies ( a.k.a . my mom , my stepfather , and me ) found this contemporary film noir to be a big disappointment . Baldwin , who also served as co - producer , brought James Lee Burke 's New Orleans ex - cop / recovering alcoholic hero Dave Robichoux from the printed page to the big screen . While Baldwin and the rest of the cast did well in fleshing out Burke 's characters and have some tangy tough - guy / gal dialogue , they 're hampered by two things : 1 . ) The film 's slo - o - o - ow pacing . Maybe the Louisiana heat got to everyone , not just Baldwin . Of all the actors , Long Island native Baldwin sweats the most , so much that it began to remind me of the sweating - bullets gags with Albert Brooks in BROADCAST NEWS and Robert Hays in AIRPLANE ! 2 . ) A plot that , as rendered in the film ( whether it 's the fault of the screenwriter or the editor , I ca n't be sure ) , never quite follows through on any of its elements . It 's too bad , because these elements could 've made for an exciting movie : drug dealing , illegal alien smuggling , rival crime bosses ( one is played colorfully by Eric Roberts before he became a parody of himself , essentially playing a Southern - fried version of his character from director Phil Joanou 's 1992 thriller FINAL ANALYSIS ) , an adorable little Salvadoran orphan girl ( named "" Alafair "" by the Robichouxs , after Dave 's mom . Late in my pregnancy at the time , I liked the name Alafair so much , I nearly changed my mind about naming my then - unborn daughter Siobhan ! ) , and a bevy of beautiful , beguiling women , including earth mother Kelly Lynch , vampy Teri Hatcher in a full - frontal nude scene that was much ballyhooed at the time , and Mary Stuart Masterson , looking like a young Jessica Lange in what was then a change - of - pace role for her : a troubled stripper who loves Robichoux . Despite the sexy promises in the movie 's ads , none of the ladies share anything with Baldwin but dialogue and some kisses and/or embraces . Maybe the climate was already so hot , the filmmakers did n't want to add any further steaminess for fear of poor Baldwin collapsing from heat prostration ! As my mom put it at the time : "" I thought the height of my day would be seeing sexy , dashing Alec Baldwin , but he came up sweaty , rumpled , tired , depressed , and moving as if he was in slow motion . If he 'd made love as many times as he got beaten up , it would 've been the sexiest picture of ' 96 ! "" To be fair , there * are * a number of strong characterization and action scenes , but there 's just too darn much talky , molasses - paced lag time between them -- and yet , oddly , some of the scenes end abruptly just as they 're about to become intriguing ! Perhaps Joanou , Baldwin Co. could 've dredged a tighter , more involving thriller out of this if they 'd whittled the 140-minute running time down to 105 minutes or so . As HEAVEN 'S PRISONERS is now ... well , read James Lee Burke 's books instead .",678,0,0.00020000000000002305,0.00020000000000002305,0.00020000000000002305,0.00020000000000002305,0.00020000000000002305,0.00020000000000002305,0.00020000000000002305,0.00020000000000002305,0.028348581957084742,0.00020000000000002305,0.00020000000000002305,0.00020000000000002305,0.19122076342097982,0.00020000000000002305,0.0101999999642599,0.00020000000000002305,0.00020000000000002305,0.00020000000000002305,0.01019482806116622,0.00020000000000002305,0.3045649260890126,0.0869967126705857,0.00020000000000002305,0.019909289995845045,0.00020000000000002305,0.018372170902381746,0.00020000000000002305,0.00020000000000002305,0.00020000000000002305,0.04540825108975887,0.00020000000000002305,0.00020000000000002305,0.00020000000000002305,0.00020000000000002305,0.00020000000000002305,0.00020000000000002305,0.04166159608912176,0.00020000000000002305,0.00020000000000002305,0.00020000000000002305,0.00020000000000002305,0.03282217917551695,0.01082529497771054,0.19207540560657518,0.00020000000000002305,0.00020000000000002305,0.00020000000000002305,0.00020000000000002305,0.00020000000000002305,0.00020000000000002305,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
56333,4,"Different Cast . Different writers ? ? ? ? ? ? ? After seeing both Peyton Place and the sequel I can tell you that I could tolerate the recast , Carol Lynley and Tuesday Weld were wonderful in their perspective parts . But I have to wonder was it only the cast that changed in this sequel did the writers change as well ? My reasons for asking , the glaring inconsistencys to the original movie . Over and over in this film it is stated that Selena was raped when she was thirteen , yet in the original film Selena , Alison and the others were graduating from high school when the incident occured . Since when do thirteen year olds graduate from high school , also she looked pretty mature for thirteen . Then there 's Selen'as boyfriend ( whose name escapes me at the moment ) in the original film he stood by her , through the murder charges , the revelation of the rape , and the miscarriage , yet in the sequel I 'm suppose to buy that he could n't handle any of it dumped her and left town where he met and married someone else . Then all the towns people after being put in their place by the town Doctor all rallied together at the end of the original film to give their support of Selena , yet in the sequel she is considered the town outcast ? I have nothing against sequels even with recast but this one strayed way too far from its original film that all creditbility for it as a sequel went out the door . It was all too obvious that the original film was n't taken into account when writing the sequel .

56340,4,"Idiotic movie about really stupid people Maybe the 1995 script was edgy and groundbreaking , but I doubt it . Since Vanilla Ice was in and out of the cultural eye 4 years before the spec script and 15 years before this movie , the concept of white kids trying to act black in the most ugly ghetto stereotypes is just not all that new . I went to high school with kids like this and I 've bought the Eminem CD . And there 's a little more to them than the stupidity . But let 's discuss the movie . Anne Hathaway plays a dumb girl who thinks that acts ghetto in her gated community and urges her boyfriend to go buy drugs in East L.A. ( ? ? ) . Seeing her boyfriend beat down , she 's eager to return and find that hot latino dude that did the beating . Then she goes to parties , gets into even more trouble and starts losing her Jerry Springer - inspired ghetto talk . The Mexican guy keeps trying to tell her that there 's more to his life than selling crack on the street corner , but well he 's doing a lot of selling crack on the street corner . Actually , he 's coming off like a gangsta Yoda ready to impart life lessons at the drop of a hat . Yes , it 's ironic that she 's trying to dress ghetto while he 's trying ( not very hard ) to dress suburban ( wife beater is suburban?)The movie 's climax is a scene in which Anne and Bijou ask the guys if they can join their "" crew "" and if the gang did n't have a sex gang initiation for women before they asked , they sure have it then ( and really , who does n't know that that 's gang initiation standard - started by the Hell 's Angels in 1965 ) . After that disaster ( both Anne and Bijous say no - but Bijou takes a little more time saying no ) the movie unravels as Anne Hathaway discovers her inner WHITE GIRL and her friends act even more stupid . There 's a neat scene between her and Bijou Philips toward the end that almost makes me like these people , but it 's one of the few points of truth in an otherwise dumb movie . The one thing this movie does is to make me appreciate DJ Squalls ' character from Hustle Flow ( and Hustle Flow in and of itself ) since that 's a white character in a black world that does n't fall into either extreme of wigger or Doogie Howser . He 's just himself whereever he goes . He 's someone the morons of this movie could learn from ( but really would n't you rather just see them all shot dead ?",495,0,0.00020618556701032536,0.00020618556701032536,0.00020618556701032536,0.00020618556701032536,0.00020618556701032536,0.02624518450563189,0.00020618556701032536,0.07045047939379463,0.00020618556701032536,0.00020618556701032536,0.00020618556701032536,0.00020618556701032536,0.23012835520061253,0.00020618556701032536,0.00020618556701032536,0.00020618556701032536,0.00020618556701032536,0.017391065522628413,0.00020618556701032536,0.00020618556701032536,0.5080630436009623,0.00020618556701032536,0.00020618556701032536,0.00020618556701032536,0.00020618556701032536,0.01630790880946602,0.00020618556701032536,0.00020618556701032536,0.00020618556701032536,0.00020618556701032536,0.00020618556701032536,0.00020618556701032536,0.00020618556701032536,0.00020618556701032536,0.00020618556701032536,0.060451680971039395,0.00020618556701032536,0.00020618556701032536,0.00020618556701032536,0.00020618556701032536,0.02609399632047522,0.00020618556701032536,0.036414677427966446,0.00020618556701032536,0.00020618556701032536,0.00020618556701032536,0.00020618556701032536,0.00020618556701032536,0.00020618556701032536,0.00020618556701032536,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

56371,4,"How to destroy your career in one simple movie George Sluizer 's original Dutch - French version of The Vanishing ( aka The Man Who Wanted to Know ) offers one of European cinema 's most quietly disturbingly anonymous and everyday sociopaths , feeling his way one step at a time towards murder . If you 've seen that version , you probably still ca n't get the final revelation out of your head , but the film had plenty more to offer than that , playing with chronology , subverting the usual cliches of its ' Lady Vanishes ' plot ( the hero wants to know what happened to his missing lover far more than he wants her to be alive ) and throwing in some excellent characterization . I can only assume that for this 1993 US remake Sluizer was so determined that no - one else was going to get the chance to ruin his film when he was perfectly capable of doing it himself , but few people could have anticipated how comprehensively he trashes his own work . His career never recovered . Chief culprit is an astonishing performance by Jeff Bridges that has been overthought through in every detail to a truly disastrous level . A friend who produced one of his earliest movies noted that Bridges was a great instinctive actor as long as you stopped him thinking about what he was doing , and this film is the proof of the pudding . Every movement is overly mechanical in its precision , making him look like a rusty clockwork toy , while his voice is a bizarre mixture of Tootsie , Latka Gravas from Taxi and a Dalek who have all been taking elocution lessons from Dok - tah E - ville . No banality of evil here , just a looney walking around with an invisible sign over his head saying "" Please . Let . Me . Kill . You . Thank you . For your . Consideration . ' But the blame really needs to be shared out here . None of the performances are good : often , they do n't even look good - Keifer Sutherland looks more like a baby hamster than a distraught man at his wits end in the hurried scenes at the gas station , Nancy Travis flounders badly and Sandra Bullock makes no impression at all as the object of his obsession . Not that they 're given any help by either director or writer Todd Graff . The script is particularly weak . The chronology has been altered to put the focus firmly on Bridges at the expense of the couple at the opening of the film . Worse is the rush the film is in , draining the life and character from each scene in its race to get to the next . Rather than the high / low mood shifts in the couple 's relationship or the apparently casual but careful establishing of the feel of the location , we just get a couple of arguments that give you the impression that he 's probably better off without her . As for the new and improved happy ending - standard woman chased by nutter in the woods jeopardy stuff complete with lame ` let 's end on a joke like a TV cop show ' moment - best not go there ... which is advice that holds for this entire trainwreck of a movie . Even a shockingly bland and uninspired Jerry Goldsmith score ca n't do anything for this one .",603,0,0.09747379625122045,0.00020408163265307758,0.00020408163265307758,0.00020408163265307758,0.00020408163265307758,0.00020408163265307758,0.00020408163265307758,0.00020408163265307758,0.04352609671783523,0.00020408163265307758,0.00020408163265307758,0.00020408163265307758,0.00020408163265307758,0.00020408163265307758,0.00020408163265307758,0.00020408163265307758,0.00020408163265307758,0.00020408163265307758,0.00020408163265307758,0.00020408163265307758,0.39804798554723514,0.00020408163265307758,0.00020408163265307758,0.00020408163265307758,0.011591608033925201,0.00020408163265307758,0.00020408163265307758,0.00020408163265307758,0.00020408163265307758,0.00020408163265307758,0.00020408163265307758,0.00020408163265307758,0.04576828500662793,0.00020408163265307758,0.00020408163265307758,0.00020408163265307758,0.00020408163265307758,0.00020408163265307758,0.03205036087593237,0.00020408163265307758,0.00020408163265307758,0.00020408163265307758,0.00020408163265307758,0.241742621174792,0.039369949268983365,0.0820619501846721,0.00020408163265307758,0.00020408163265307758,0.00020408163265307758,0.00020408163265307758,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0

56377,4,"it doomed alright During my teenage years I was a fan of WWF wrestling and specifically , the Rock . He was a tremendous wrestler who the fans admired right away because of his talent to be extremely funny on the microphone and cut some of the funniest , most disgusting lines ever mentioned on WWF TV . His talent in the ring was spot - on , and the Rock would always give the people everything he had when it came time to step in the ring and compete . He rarely made a mistake in the ring ... but he made a HUGE mistake stepping away from wrestling and walking down the path to Hollywood . It 's not that Doom is really a bad movie . Sure , it was a movie considered a disappointment right from the get go because no one wanted to watch it at the movie theaters . It 's just a normal , monster - shooting film that delivers a tiny amount of suspense , and that 's it . I 'm sure the movie would 've been big had it been released 10 years ago . Todays generation is probably sick of go - nowhere do - nothing action films such as Doom . Okay , so it DOES go somewhere , but the film is n't really designed to build to an awe - inspiring creative story . Doom is the kind of movie you do n't really want to seek out- you just happen to come across it at the video store and decide you need a quick 90-minute action fix , so you rent the movie , watch it , and then forget about it the next morning . Of course , I 'm sure you do n't forget to rewind the tape because that 's impolite . The Rock never should have left wrestling . It was a bad career move and the millions of wrestling fans ( and the Rock means MILLIONS ) really miss him . Come back home , Rock .

Too damn bad for your buddy . It was obvious this was not quite of the caliber daring / bold/ and challenging as some of Herzogs past films . We have been fans for 20 + years . Looks like he did it for the money and Dorrington rodeHerzogs coatails in a way . Geez .. I had just watched March of the Penguins and Wings of Migration and those ! are truly documentaries made by film experts . The babbling and rambling on in The White Diamond made me pity Herzog . He did it for the $ maybe . Dorrington yammers on and on in such a disgusting way I suggest you turn the sound off and fast forward to the end shotsof the waterfall and the swifts .

56408,4,"Disappointing ......... very disappointing The picture book of the same name by Chris Van Allsberg is one of my favorite Christmas stories of all times . So I was pretty excited to hear Hollywood was making a movie version and a great actor like Tom Hanks was a leading participant . What a disappointment ! The movie 's tone is empty and wintery at best and at worst downright creepy . There are macabre touches throughout the movie with the most memorable being a mysterious hobo ( apparently supernatural ? ) who appears on top of the train from time to time and utters interesting Christmas messages such as "" Do you believe in Ghosts ? "" The "" lighter "" scenes are so frenzied and overblown they do nothing to give the viewer a more cheerful holiday feeling . Admittedly I saw the movie in DVD format on the small screen and I am told many of the scenes played better in 3D. Yet "" The Polar Express "" still remains a highly unusual and uniquely unmerry Christmas movie especially for a presumed target audience of families with young children .",192,0,0.0005000000000000471,0.0005000000000000471,0.0005000000000000471,0.0005000000000000471,0.0005000000000000471,0.0005000000000000471,0.0005000000000000471,0.0005000000000000471,0.050299531574128024,0.0005000000000000471,0.0005000000000000471,0.02564119203999174,0.0005000000000000471,0.0005000000000000471,0.0005000000000000471,0.0005000000000000471,0.0005000000000000471,0.0005000000000000471,0.0005000000000000471,0.0005000000000000471,0.4986729404903128,0.0005000000000000471,0.0005000000000000471,0.0005000000000000471,0.03039097058770389,0.0005000000000000471,0.0005000000000000471,0.0005000000000000471,0.0005000000000000471,0.0005000000000000471,0.0005000000000000471,0.0005000000000000471,0.0005000000000000471,0.0005000000000000471,0.12058621963920345,0.0005000000000000471,0.03406407272264471,0.0005000000000000471,0.0005000000000000471,0.0005000000000000471,0.0005000000000000471,0.0005000000000000471,0.0005000000000000471,0.21884507294601324,0.0005000000000000471,0.0005000000000000471,0.0005000000000000471,0.0005000000000000471,0.0005000000000000471,0.0005000000000000471,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

56431,4,"The Magic is n't There This is a fantasy film about a family of witches in modern times . The Owens girls are hereditary witches , any man who loves one is doomed to an early death . There is a scene where a woman asks for a love potion , this requires the sacrifice of a dove . Two little girls watch . Years later they 're grown up . One leaves to live with her boyfriend . But the curse returns and a boyfriend is run over by a truck ( never stand in the middle of a road ) . We see scenes where the neighbor kids yell "" witch "" , as if to symbolize something . Sally goes when Jillian calls her ; she has a problem with her boyfriend . But Sally uses a "" magic potion "" to eliminate the problem . Now Jillian wants to undo what was done . [ The film began to lose me now , it was n't funny . ] The spell goes awry , they bury their mistake . Then there is a scene where the ladies are all giggles . Later an investigator comes around looking for Jimmy . [ The story drags again . ] More scenes follow ; they are not funny or scary or even entertaining . But a scene in the attic will wake you even if you 're snoozing ! They call some friends over to cast a spell to drive a demon out of Jillian . It seems to work , even if they do n't use the standard issue witches broom . There is a sort of happy ending . Sandra and Nicole are good actresses , but they ca n't cast a spell to improve the script of one of the worst movies I 've ever seen . "" Bell , Book , and Candle "" is a funnier film , "" Blair Witch "" is a scarier film .

56445,4,"Bad Quality DVD The video in this DVD looks as though it was put through a simple computer program that decoded it for going on to a DVD disc . A standard 4.7 GB disc , by the way ; that 's what you 'll get when you buy this . I say this because I 've used those programs before and know how they alter the video . This is how they alter it , and how it looks on this USA release of the DVD : Skin color is too red . Dark ( shadowed ) areas are greenish . White / beige is pinkish . Grey is bluish . White has blue on it . The colors are just totally messed up . Evidence of grey being blue = look at Robert Duvall 's uniform ( you 'll see him 3 minutes into the movie ) . The german uniform is a semi - light grey . It is too dark and filled with blue . Then look behind him at the wall . A lovely dark shadow of green . Evidence of white / beige being pinkish , when Robert Duvall walks into that office , look at the walls . They should be a kind of white / beige color but they are not a shade of white at all , they are pinkish . As he walks into the office to sit down , you see curtains on the wall in the office . They are supposed to be white , but they 're filled with blue . At 48 minutes into the movie , you see Donald Sutherland sitting in the grass with the character Molly . His suit is supposed to be black . Look at it . It 's purple . That is not black . On top of all that , the movie is too dark . There should have been a brightness / contrast adjustment . If you pay attention to dark areas in the movie , such as fixtures around a room or an office , most times , they are pitch black and indistinguished . For example , look at desk drawers , telephones , vases , black hair , black jackets .. even Robert Duvall 's eye patch . Not much shading , usually pitch black . I've read that this movie apparently was not remastered for the North American release . I plan to get the Region 2 ( Europe ) release . I 'd rather do without watching it on my TV and watch it on my computer in better , "" proper "" quality .

56451,4,"Not very verosimile . It is a pity that a wonderful picture is demerited by Roger Moore ' performance . Her 's good for a dandy , in the continent , but in this film he is not convincing at all . He is verry debonnaire , like he is just sipping tea in Great Britain . Thus , the film becomes stiff and you do n't believe it . The other actors simply try to do something , like a farce . It is a pity to see the great Richard Burton in such role .

56453,4,"Not for Beginners This stability ball workout is definitely a more advanced routine and is not for beginners . This was the first stability ball DVD that I purchased and became quickly frustrated with the routine due to the level . If you are a beginner , I would recommend Leslie Sansone 's You can do Stability Ball training . If you are a beginner or more advanced , I would recommend Denise Austin 's Shrink the Female Fat Zone or the QuickFix Stability Ball training . My all time favorite DVD for the stability ball is Denise Austin .

56462,4,"Old Action Heroes do n't die , they just fade away . Instructions : rent Steven Seagall 's latest action movie knuckle - fest "" Exit Wounds "" . Insert in DVD player ; watch first 15 minutes of movie , remove from DVD player . Return to video store . If you follow those instructions to the letter , you 'll have fun with "" Exit Wounds "" , which features one of the best opening sequences of any action movie in recent memory ( Seagall attempts to thwart a brash , brazen assassination attempt ) . There 's also a great scene --- strike that , a Priceless Scene : hipster uber - villain ( played convincingly by rapper DMX ) and a henchman go on a shopping spree in an exotic car lot ( ultimately settling on a Lamborghini Murcielago , paid for in cash out of a golf bag).The scene is dope , def , and cool --- it 's all GOOD , Dawgz!----,in a New Jack City way . And that 's a shame , really : it 's so cool it just makes you grind your teeth as you begin , over the course of two hours , to realize that the rest of the movie just ca n't hold a candle to its opening minutes . An action movie should be exciting ; after Seagall foils a neatly organized assassination attempt on the U.S. Vice President ( a brilliant little sequence which merits one star on its own , and from which 95 % of the trailer material was taken ) , "" Exit Wounds "" is not exciting . It 's stale . It 's rehashed . Honestly , were it not for DMX , the few riffs from the movie 's excellent rap soundtrack , and the equipment , I would have thought I was watching an eighties Seagall flick . And that 's surprising , given that the movie is helmed by "" Romeo Must Die "" director Andrzej Bartkowiak , who also did the cinematography for Speed , Lethal Weapon 4 , and Devil 's Advocate . The plot , what there is of it , deals with police corruption , and features a major twist near the end that takes the punch out of the story and does n't make any sense --- but by that time you 've stopped caring . You 've seen all of this before --- done better . Worst of all , Seagall is just too old to be a credible action hero ; he 's reached that wheezing , shortness of breath stage that afflicted Roger Moore back in "" View to a Kill""---except Seagall does n't have the acting chops that Moore was able to fall back on . Tom Arnold is thrown in for laughs , but the laughs are so feeble , and the jokes so stale , that you 're laughing * at * Arnold and Seagall --- not with them . Midway through "" Exit Wounds "" I was fighting to stay awake , and that 's a shame , given that the first 15 minutes of the movie contained more sheer , hectic energy than any movie I 've seen since "" Face / Off "" . Rent the DVD for that opener if you dare , but if you stay any longer you 'll see it 's true : Old Action Heroes never die , they just fade away .

56489,4,"BORING very un - natural ( almost fake ) This program was BORING ! As much as Billy tried to keep the kid on the program motivated , about 10 minutes into the workout they were showing how bored they were , and of course my kids at home , and I 'm sure any other kid picked up on this , and soon lost interest . Several things made this program boring : One , you ca n't understand a thing Billy is saying , he would mumble unclear phrases thoughout the entire program , and his demeanor was very un - natural , to the point of being fake . He just looked sounded very out of place working with kids . It came across like he his crew were n't really sure how to interact with the kids , making them appear to be very fake . Another boring point was the movements , there was absolutely NO creativity here , these were some of the EXACT same movements from the adult Tae - Bo videos . Now , I do applaud Billy for slowing the movements down ( unlike the adult Tae - Bo which goes at a break neck pace ) , these movements are performed in a controlled manner . But , they are still adult type movements , and extremely boring for kids . I would have liked to have seen some creativity with these movements to make them more kid friendly , and more EXCITING!To be honest my kids were turned off bored with this program after the first 10 minutes . Something Billy needs to realize is , kids are smarter than people give them credit for being . - They can tell when someone is being fake not truly having fun , and they also realize that when kids on T.V. are bored not having fun , then this is n't something they want to do . Kids want to have fun , and want to watch the instructor other kids having fun .

56495,4,"depends on what you want Each scene is one shot , and that shot goes on and on and on , sometimes staying with the same act or lack of action . This film is pretension personified , but that 's okay . Many people ca n't tell the difference between pretension and art . The music too is full of squeaks and squawks . In case you did n't know , that means that the music too is high art . There is no story . Boy and girl see each other , and without preliminaries hit the sack . We see boy girl here , there , in the sack , here , there , in the sack , etc . Occasionally we get a shot of some of the other characters . Because of the lack of dynamics , the film is not effective , either as drama or as eroticism . Ironically , "" The Summer of ' 42 "" was much more erotic even without any nudity ( which would have helped ) . The vaulted sex scenes are three in number , chest and shoulders , and they last about three minutes each . The much - touted fellatio scene is actually surprisingly good , more convincing than the "" love "" scenes . There are also a few brief full - frontal scenes of the star , who has a gorgeous body ( hence , the two star rating ) . Bottom line : the only reason to see this movie is the nudity and the sex . But there are many better movies for that . So , only if you need the pretentiousness in order to permit yourself to see a sex movie should you see this .",297,0,0.13988136071926094,0.00037735849056607095,0.00037735849056607095,0.00037735849056607095,0.00037735849056607095,0.00037735849056607095,0.00037735849056607095,0.00037735849056607095,0.00037735849056607095,0.00037735849056607095,0.00037735849056607095,0.00037735849056607095,0.00037735849056607095,0.00037735849056607095,0.00037735849056607095,0.00037735849056607095,0.00037735849056607095,0.00037735849056607095,0.01923896375695597,0.00037735849056607095,0.13562404349208815,0.1903876170150699,0.00037735849056607095,0.00037735849056607095,0.07912604713181401,0.042043997709999975,0.00037735849056607095,0.00037735849056607095,0.03385677486463498,0.00037735849056607095,0.00037735849056607095,0.00037735849056607095,0.00037735849056607095,0.00037735849056607095,0.00037735849056607095,0.02903166094257227,0.00037735849056607095,0.00037735849056607095,0.00037735849056607095,0.00037735849056607095,0.00037735849056607095,0.00037735849056607095,0.00037735849056607095,0.26439531598415933,0.00037735849056607095,0.051319878760801824,0.00037735849056607095,0.00037735849056607095,0.00037735849056607095,0.00037735849056607095,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0

Streep can do any accent on the planet , and sprinkle it with more affected mannerisms than Marcel Marceau . That does n't make her an actress - just a clever chameleon . I 'd rather watch Julia Roberts play herself over and over and over than see Streep play "" pretend "" roles . There , I 've said it .

56503,4,"Potentially very hot , but sucked instead ! I generally like some of these French - comic - books - turned - into - movies because they 're usually pretty erotic . Jane Fonda 's role in Barbarella comes to mind . This Gwendoline series definitely had the POTENTIAL what with the scantily - clad women - in - bondage theme and the scenes involving Gwendoline with her dominant girlfriend . But the very beautiful Tawney Kitaen ( cast as Gwendoline ) apparently balked at doing girl / girl scenes ( this was 1984 , after all ) , and so the producers obligingly did n't force her to do any , and as a result this one turned into a very bland , weak , and diluted version of Raiders of the Lost Ark. It 's not a good adventure film , and it 's certainly not erotic . There 's a little nudity , and some ridiculous moments that are supposed to capture the kinkiness of the French comics , but overall this one was a disappointing bust .",181,0,0.000606060606060672,0.000606060606060672,0.000606060606060672,0.000606060606060672,0.000606060606060672,0.000606060606060672,0.000606060606060672,0.000606060606060672,0.06383430625552268,0.000606060606060672,0.000606060606060672,0.000606060606060672,0.000606060606060672,0.000606060606060672,0.000606060606060672,0.000606060606060672,0.000606060606060672,0.000606060606060672,0.000606060606060672,0.000606060606060672,0.49145080374227396,0.1947130307303661,0.000606060606060672,0.03570799744668636,0.000606060606060672,0.000606060606060672,0.000606060606060672,0.000606060606060672,0.000606060606060672,0.000606060606060672,0.000606060606060672,0.000606060606060672,0.000606060606060672,0.000606060606060672,0.000606060606060672,0.000606060606060672,0.04994349766073577,0.000606060606060672,0.000606060606060672,0.000606060606060672,0.000606060606060672,0.000606060606060672,0.04764404957914228,0.09064570852466382,0.000606060606060672,0.000606060606060672,0.000606060606060672,0.000606060606060672,0.000606060606060672,0.000606060606060672,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

Several times during the movie I tried to talk her out of watching but she wanted to see what happened in the end . Fortunately the movie is relatively short . Overall , I found the story to be a cynical look at Christmas .

In short , it 's not . And let me be absolutely clear about one thing : I have known and loved this film for years . A few sequences look properly spectacular , but after watching this DVD on two separate ( and high - quality ) televisions , I 'm amazed that all of the low - light scenes have been rendered almost completely dark . Like , too dark to tell what 's even * happening * . For instance , the scene where Brad ( Harry Carey , Jr. ) runs off to his death , the scene where Marty 's ( Jeffrey Hunter 's ) "" bride "" is serving coffee along the river , and even the pre - dawn scenes leading up to the final storming of the Comanche camp , are utterly lost in the dark . By contrast , the bare - bones 1997 DVD release features noticeably richer colors in the daytime scenes and total clarity in the low - light scenes I 've just mentioned . Do n't waste your money on this special edition ; you 'll be much happier if you just shell out the $ 10.99 for the 1997 release .",271,0,0.03557614072489966,0.00032786885245904155,0.02278489167773313,0.03172982571894915,0.00032786885245904155,0.018691850021596856,0.07321923056325855,0.00032786885245904155,0.09154395032300683,0.00032786885245904155,0.00032786885245904155,0.00032786885245904155,0.10367850453522019,0.00032786885245904155,0.00032786885245904155,0.00032786885245904155,0.00032786885245904155,0.03511179397980304,0.00032786885245904155,0.00032786885245904155,0.046840279801802075,0.00032786885245904155,0.00032786885245904155,0.00032786885245904155,0.00032786885245904155,0.00032786885245904155,0.00032786885245904155,0.00032786885245904155,0.00032786885245904155,0.00032786885245904155,0.00032786885245904155,0.00032786885245904155,0.08231071297844288,0.00032786885245904155,0.00032786885245904155,0.00032786885245904155,0.00032786885245904155,0.00032786885245904155,0.00032786885245904155,0.060201693049397625,0.039126072643913996,0.00032786885245904155,0.00032786885245904155,0.25353035355164677,0.09385142174180365,0.00032786885245904155,0.00032786885245904155,0.00032786885245904155,0.00032786885245904155,0.00032786885245904155,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0
56533,4,"A watery , passive , poorly cast , revisionist production Filming the story of Gloriana is a virtual guarantee of success for a production studio , from Warner Brothers to BBC . The Virgin Queen still retains her power to enthrall , intrigue and mystify these 500 years after she came to the throne . She was perhaps England 's last true absolute monarch , and certainly one of its greatest , if not most famous . Since the advent of film , she has been one of the most coveted roles to play . Indeed , few monarchs have been so closely chronicled , save perhaps her own father , Henry VIII , and Victoria . She has been portrayed by some of the most brilliant actresses : Sarah Bernhardt , Bette Davis , Judi Dench , Judith Anderson , Miranda Richardson , Flora Robson , Cate Blanchett , Helen Mirren , even Quentin Crisp , and most famously , and importantly , Glenda Jackson . And it must be said without doubt that Glenda Jackson 's "" Elizabeth R "" is the defining portrait-- the most accomplished , historically accurate , and masterfully acted . Glenda Jackson is Elizabeth I reincarnate ; there is simply none better , and likely never will be . So now we have Anne - Marie Duff in the red wig for 230 Masterpiece Theatre minutes . Perhaps for the sake of revisionists , we are offered a far less imperious monarch , one who is both reactive ( the real one was ) and passive ( the real one was not ) . Duff is an odd choice . No beauty like Cate Blanchett , but Elizabeth was known for vanity , not beauty . Duff 's Elizabeth , with quivering lip and watercolor behavior , seems filmed underwater , and make for an undesirable monarch-- certainly not the Gloriana of myth or fact . Where is her famous wit , her coy manipulations , her strong moral fiber , her intense devotion to state and loyal courtiers ? Left with Glenda Jackson , I suppose . This Elizabeth is a simpering , love - struck maiden or a crass , 60-something hag ( and only then do we see bits of fire in the performance ) . Hag works ; crass manages ; simpering loses the whole impact . A suavely elegant , very attractive and distinctly healthy Queen Mary I opens Elizabeth 's story ( no Catharine Parr , no Thomas Seymour , no childhood ) but is quickly dispatched . Just as well , for she 's thoroughly ill - cast -- Mary was none of those things . ( Far better was the wonderful Kathy Burke in the Blanchett version , though she was a bit of a Protestant caricature ) . Daphne Slater in the Jackson series was far more appealing , and perfectly written . Elizabeth 's transition from prisoner to crown is possibly the greatest story of her long life . No part of her history defines and creates her personality more than these years-- the abuse by Seymour , imprisonment , exile , and finally her accession . Unfortunately , much of this key period is sped through . The fatal flaw in the series is the decision to cast Elizabeth mooning incessantly over Robert Dudley , later Earl of Leicester , here played by a childish , petulant Tom Hardy . There is no chemistry here ; he is pretty , but vacant . Glenda Jackson 's Dudley , Robert Hardy ( no relation that I know of ) , is a bit of a fop , but he knows his place in court and Elizabeth 's heart . Their chemistry is clear . This version of Dudley is a bit ridiculous-- how he would claim the Queen 's heart for more than 30 years is a mystery in this performance . So is most of the casting ( what 's with the acrobat?)An egregious error in this production is the portrayal of suicide by Dudley 's long - suffering wife Amy Robsart , whose death at 26 in 1560 remains to this day a mystery . More time should have been spent on the wooing of Elizabeth by the French Duc d'Alencon , who very nearly came to be her husband ( again , the 1971 Glenda Jackson version handles this segment masterfully).All too soon and without sufficient explanation , we become immersed in the historically key , decades - long battle of wills and imprisonment of the impetuous Mary , Queen of Scots-- Elizabeth 's 2nd cousin , granddaughter of Henry VIII 's older sister Margaret , whose claim to the English throne made her a rallying point of Catholics , and a very real threat to Elizabeth ( it was Mary 's son James who succeeded Elizabeth in 1603 , founding the ill - fated House of Stuart ) . Far more attention should have been paid to the case for and subsequent execution of Mary , Queen of Scots , which was Elizabeth 's darkest hour-- forever bloodying her saintly propaganda . Likewise , more attention should have been given to Walshingham , Elizabeth 's master of subversion , although William Cecil , Lord Burghley , is given fair due . The decisive Armada happens much too quickly , lessening its impact and giving far too much time to be spent on the stormy relationship of Elizabeth and Robert Devereaux , Earl of Essex , portrayed by Hans Matheson , who is cast and directed as a bad - tempered , bipolar "" Mama 's Boy "" ( a very strange Oedipal twist here ) whose hair , look and even attire speak far more to 2005 than 1585 . The entire second half of the production is brought down by this admittedly strange relationship , here given a basketful of psychological issues left to the viewer to consider unraveling . The casting is awful , the acting mediocre , the personality baffling . This Essex is a wreck-- blame the revisionist director . Two significant annoyances : Elizabeth 's ( Duff 's ) accent is n't simply London middle - class , which would be fine , but stands in stark contrast to everyone else 's appropriate English diction and clarity . She comes off as a guttersnipe . And worse of all-- distracting to the utmost-- is the incessant soundtrack that dominates -- and not pleasantly-- the action and plot of the movie . The sheer volume of it is horrendous , to say nothing of the attempts at mixing courtly historical period music with Essex 's electric guitar . My suggestion here is to rent this one , watch it as long as you can , and then return to Davis , Blanchett , Jackson , or even Dench . Overall , a disappointment . Were it not for 95 % historical accuracy and enjoyable period costumes-- plus the decent acting ( most of the problems are the director 's fault , do n't blame the actors ) , it would have earned one star . But this Queen is no legend , and this cast is horrendous . An inglorious Gloriana .",1217,0,0.00015503875968994195,0.00015503875968994195,0.00015503875968994195,0.00015503875968994195,0.00015503875968994195,0.00015503875968994195,0.00015503875968994195,0.00015503875968994195,0.0777804847737402,0.00015503875968994195,0.00015503875968994195,0.008157509530622453,0.00015503875968994195,0.00015503875968994195,0.007898885326564593,0.00015503875968994195,0.00015503875968994195,0.00015503875968994195,0.01563265277938172,0.00839180444677562,0.07912839521045865,0.09255967451031955,0.00015503875968994195,0.026222497515233402,0.00015503875968994195,0.00015503875968994195,0.04921311319023542,0.00015503875968994195,0.00015503875968994195,0.01765699887655611,0.00015503875968994195,0.00015503875968994195,0.15400834006309297,0.00015503875968994195,0.00015503875968994195,0.00015503875968994195,0.00015503875968994195,0.025034868814984373,0.011547076416709533,0.00015503875968994195,0.03909379113517648,0.03989842406868392,0.00015503875968994195,0.3425041655120069,0.00015503875968994195,0.00015503875968994195,0.00015503875968994195,0.00015503875968994195,0.00015503875968994195,0.00015503875968994195,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

56548,4,"2 stars for cameos A dull dull movie that perpetuates stereotypes of latinos in the US and abroad . I was very bored with this movie and found the plot to be very insulting . I enjoyed seeing some of my favorite latino actors and performers on the big screen , but for a somewhat mainstreamed movie that one can buy in target , I think it 's just a shame . The whole cast was pretty much of Latin America origin , but that did not do much to glorify latinos as capable and deserving actors on the spotlight . The plot and dialogue dehumanizies and insults many .",110,0,0.0009523809523809998,0.0009523809523809998,0.0009523809523809998,0.0009523809523809998,0.0009523809523809998,0.0009523809523809998,0.0009523809523809998,0.0009523809523809998,0.04062858272940057,0.0009523809523809998,0.0009523809523809998,0.0009523809523809998,0.0009523809523809998,0.0009523809523809998,0.0009523809523809998,0.0009523809523809998,0.0009523809523809998,0.05201198031935565,0.0009523809523809998,0.0009523809523809998,0.7588532109426014,0.10469670219911649,0.0009523809523809998,0.0009523809523809998,0.0009523809523809998,0.0009523809523809998,0.0009523809523809998,0.0009523809523809998,0.0009523809523809998,0.0009523809523809998,0.0009523809523809998,0.0009523809523809998,0.0009523809523809998,0.0009523809523809998,0.0009523809523809998,0.0009523809523809998,0.0009523809523809998,0.0009523809523809998,0.0009523809523809998,0.0009523809523809998,0.0009523809523809998,0.0009523809523809998,0.0009523809523809998,0.0009523809523809998,0.0009523809523809998,0.0009523809523809998,0.0009523809523809998,0.0009523809523809998,0.0009523809523809998,0.0009523809523809998,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1
56555,4,Poor Release of Movie I found this movie very poor and totally a waste of my time . It 's plot needs to be rewritten and it does not contain a deeper meaning . The ending was very disapointing and without proper conclusion . Denzel Washington did a great job playing the detective and John Goodman is a very good actor yet the other charaters did not do thier job and was poorly acted . My recommendation is to stay away from this movie and save your money . Buy somthing that has a good plot .

56562,4,"What the ..... Honestly , nothing about this show grabs me . I 'm surprised this show gets such high Nielsen ratings every week . The writers tend to come up with similar stories all the time . But the biggest flaw is the acting . It is really laughable . Me and my friends watch this sometimes to laugh at how ridiculous everyone seems to be . Horatio Caine talks in a slow drawl all the time , saying the stupidest and most obvious things . Calleigh is always smiling at everyone and everything up to the point it gets irritating . None of the C.S.I team displays any emotion whatsoever , oh ... except Horatio when he over does it . The stories are also terribly boring and utterly predictable . If there 's a V.I.P suspect with a "" history "" with Horatio , yup ... you guessed it , he 's involved ( either directly or indirectly ) . And also , if the suspect appears in about 10 minutes into the show ... yea , it 's not him . And Calleigh gets "" evidence "" such as DNA from saliva etc almost every episode using her sexuality . I mean , once or twice is alright ... but I 've seen about 8 - 10 episodes and she does it all the time . Every criminal here is an idiot , they are sure to leave all kinds of huge "" clues "" leading to them or their alliances . And every crime gets solved all the time . Oh , and is it just me or does the C.S.I team seem to know everything under the sun at their fingertips , no need for books or researching , they already have it that big brain of theirs . Think that 's unlikely ? Exactly my point . In short , I would n't move appointments or hurry home to watch this show . In fact , even if someone gives me this DVD set as a gift , I would probably keep it aside or maybe present it to someoene else . Watch this show if you 're REALLY bored , with nothing else to do and no better use of your time . If you want real Crime Scene Investigation , watch the original C.S.I , Las Vegas .

56582,4,"A Disappointment First of all , I am a Joy Division and New Order fan ; therefore , I tried to like this . Really , I did . Sadly , this film stinks . The focus is not on the bands themselves , but on the obnoxious character known as Tony Wilson . What a monster ! Either it was the actor 's depiction or he does truly have a horrid personality in real life . Maybe I 'm not British , but I did not find 24 Hour Party People to be very funny . Only a few scenes made me grin . The randomness added very little to the overall quality of the film . In addition , the camera work was very jerky . Looked like it was done by a novice ( and yes , I 'm one myself , having made two movies)The only redeeming aspect has to be the scenes with Joy Division .

56589,4,"A movie on Castellano , how boring . I love Chazz P. and I can see why he would want to give the other side of the Castellano epic , but man is this movie boring . Castellano has to be one of the most uninvolved mobsters ever to take the reins of a crime family . If you know the history of this guy , than you should agree , and if you do n't , read some books about him . As powerful as he was , he sure did n't know much about running a crime family as did his predecessors , which this film does n't portray . The film also has terrible actors portraying both Sammy the Bull and John Gotti . An insult at that . If you like mafia movies and do n't care about the history of its real - life characters than by all means watch it .

56662,4,"Overrated , juvenile writing This series might be considered a classic if watched by a 12-year - old , but adults will see though the indistinct plot and characters . Most of the plot 's famous "" unpleasantness "" is just tacked on to the main story , and is of no significance . Apart from putting several of the characters though lots of physical abuses , nothing much gets accomplished thought the series . The main female character clocks about 100 words of dialog across the entire series , so do n't bother waiting for any meaningful information from her . The male lead has the typical task of pointing out all the flaws in the alternate world he 's been transported to , inbetween having the stuffing beaten out of him . The most arbitrary abuses are handed out to a young woman , who 's included in the story for no reason except to be abused- you can almost hear the writers saying , "" I got it ! Let 's rape a little girl , that 'll make it REAL ! Yeah , Yeah , I like it ! "" Having served her purpose , the character then vanishes until being plopped back in near the end of the series , so a little more misery can be dumped on her . All the characters suffer from lack of depth and motivation . The releative standout would be the villian , who suffers from bipolarism , and alternates between terror , anger , delight , and misery , somtimes all within the same scene . Too bad that was about all he did in the show . Well , that 's about enough . If you have an appetite for "" Kid saves alternate universe "" themed anime , then you may like this .

56669,4,"I Do n't Get It There is one thing I finally grasped upon watching ' The 40 Year Old Virgin ' , however . I came to the realization that Hollywood has to remake movies now over and over and over again because the films that try to be unique ( ' The 40 Year Old Virgin ' ) are so awful that studio heads need to go elsewhere for their ideas . Of course , they 're laughing all the way to the bank because the brain dead inside and outside of the continental United States will be for , and laugh at , anything . This film is popular because Steve Carrell makes the same faces and has the same delivery that he did / does on ' The Office ' , and people just love those mannerisms ( Ricky Gervals is better in the same role , by the way ... but that 's neither here nor there ) . It certainly could n't be because it 's funny . The general concept of a 40 year old virgin has promise . That concept added with the most boiled down Middle School potty jokes is not . That concept added to a girl who wants to take him home but is too drunk to drive , yet she does it anyway and runs into dozens of objects is not . That concept added with a cross eyed Asian woman waxing his hairy chest while they show extreme close up 's of Carrells large nose as he screams vulgarities into the lens is not . That concept added with 60 year old Middle Eastern Salesmen using every sexual metaphor out loud is not . You get the drift . Maybe the boat left and I was n't on the boat . Maybe I 'm not 12 years old anymore and am amused by jokes you used to hear outside at recess playing tether ball and eating Chocodiles . If you like juvenile humor , watch something like ' Better Off Dead ' or ' Caddyshack ' . Watch a movie that does n't have to try so hard to write something vulgar to get a laugh .

56670,4,"Please enter a title for your review One of the most overrated comedy shows ever . Basically the calibre of a high school talent show . In a way it reminds me of Tom Goes To The Mayor , seemingly fitting into a comedy niche I do n't understand which is more about being weird than being clever , but it seems like it 's even more about being dull than being weird . I 've heard improv described as being not about trying to think of something funny to say but just saying whatever comes into your head . I think these guys took that a bit too much to heart . Maybe the fans see some subtle naunces I 'm missing , but to me it seems like I could have written most of this material with little effort .",142,0,0.27665099396966963,0.0006060606060606747,0.0006060606060606747,0.0006060606060606747,0.0006060606060606747,0.03580200148696217,0.0006060606060606747,0.0006060606060606747,0.0006060606060606747,0.0006060606060606747,0.0006060606060606747,0.0006060606060606747,0.0006060606060606747,0.0006060606060606747,0.0006060606060606747,0.0006060606060606747,0.0006060606060606747,0.0006060606060606747,0.0006060606060606747,0.0006060606060606747,0.46419157373306635,0.0006060606060606747,0.0006060606060606747,0.03546437330941035,0.0006060606060606747,0.10018126911334048,0.0006060606060606747,0.0006060606060606747,0.0006060606060606747,0.0006060606060606747,0.0006060606060606747,0.0006060606060606747,0.0006060606060606747,0.0006060606060606747,0.0006060606060606747,0.0006060606060606747,0.0006060606060606747,0.0006060606060606747,0.0006060606060606747,0.0006060606060606747,0.0006060606060606747,0.0006060606060606747,0.0006060606060606747,0.0006060606060606747,0.06104312172088119,0.0006060606060606747,0.0006060606060606747,0.0006060606060606747,0.0006060606060606747,0.0006060606060606747,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

56718,4,"Happy holiday ! 20 years ago , there was a terrible accident in the mine on Valentine 's Day . The following year one of the miners , Harry Warden , takes a terrible revange on those responsible for the accident . Since that day , there is no celebration of Valentine 's Day in the little town Valentine 's Buff . Until now ( that is 1981 ) . But Harry Warden seems to have returned to stop the celebration . The music as music is quite good , but it does n't lead the film in any direction , so it 's not helping . The story is recycled , which is good , but could have been much more minimalistic . Why not just have the party and let the miner kill the kids ? And trying to put a twist to the story by "" explaining "" things is seldom very helpful . The murderar places human hearts in Valentine boxes which is distasteful but not really scary . A variation on the holiday theme , that could have been a bit more focused .",189,0,0.0006451612903226197,0.0006451612903226197,0.0006451612903226197,0.0006451612903226197,0.0006451612903226197,0.032944245508234604,0.0006451612903226197,0.04783200926094954,0.0006451612903226197,0.0006451612903226197,0.0006451612903226197,0.032667497500364656,0.35602702141798015,0.0006451612903226197,0.0006451612903226197,0.0006451612903226197,0.0006451612903226197,0.0006451612903226197,0.03290322580645177,0.0006451612903226197,0.0006451612903226197,0.2233141603701023,0.0006451612903226197,0.0006451612903226197,0.04852563153338889,0.0006451612903226197,0.0006451612903226197,0.0006451612903226197,0.07004035449396208,0.0006451612903226197,0.0006451612903226197,0.0006451612903226197,0.0006451612903226197,0.0006451612903226197,0.0006451612903226197,0.0006451612903226197,0.0006451612903226197,0.0006451612903226197,0.0006451612903226197,0.0006451612903226197,0.07402745391652593,0.0006451612903226197,0.0006451612903226197,0.0559119485791355,0.0006451612903226197,0.0006451612903226197,0.0006451612903226197,0.0006451612903226197,0.0006451612903226197,0.0006451612903226197,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
56721,4,"Disney 's Worst Animated Feature I first saw the movie poster and was n't particlularly inspired by the idea of cows going after an evil cow rustler . But then I heard composer Alan Menken ( who had worked on Beauty The Beast and Aladdin ) was attached and this made me rethink my position . Then unfortunately the trailer made me rethink my position back to what it was before . Still , I went into the movie theater ready to give "" Home On The Range "" a chance ... ... and fell asleep . I found the soundtrack uninspired and the story incredibly weak . I admit the animation is fine ( but not spectacular ) and some of the jokes are funny but they are very few and far between . Apparently "" Home On The Range "" was meant to be released before "" Brother Bear "" but because of story issues it was delayed . I do n't think it should have been made in the first place . It has also ruined the work laid out by "" Brother Bear "" for a new Disney renaissance . I think whoever said yes to this movie should be fired , because not only is it terrible , but it ended mainstream 2-D animation for Disney , a massive loss to the entertainment industry . The DVD has an audio commentary ( with rather overconfident directors if you ask me considering this movie is a disaster ) . There is also a behind the scenes featurette , games , art review and music video- more than this movie that never should have happened deserves .",280,0,0.0005263157894737404,0.0005263157894737404,0.0005263157894737404,0.0005263157894737404,0.0005263157894737404,0.0005263157894737404,0.0005263157894737404,0.0005263157894737404,0.0005263157894737404,0.0005263157894737404,0.0005263157894737404,0.0005263157894737404,0.0005263157894737404,0.0005263157894737404,0.0005263157894737404,0.0005263157894737404,0.0005263157894737404,0.03535992473420666,0.0005263157894737404,0.0005263157894737404,0.5263537857070408,0.0005263157894737404,0.04952495222854306,0.0005263157894737404,0.0005263157894737404,0.0005263157894737404,0.0005263157894737404,0.0005263157894737404,0.0005263157894737404,0.0005263157894737404,0.0005263157894737404,0.0005263157894737404,0.12497097548723911,0.0005263157894737404,0.09996090959004347,0.0005263157894737404,0.0005263157894737404,0.0005263157894737404,0.06104997553170413,0.0005263157894737404,0.0005263157894737404,0.0005263157894737404,0.0005263157894737404,0.0005263157894737404,0.034618551488585114,0.04605566207474034,0.0005263157894737404,0.0005263157894737404,0.0005263157894737404,0.0005263157894737404,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0

56729,4,"Wonderful production value , bummer story I am a BBC devotee and officionado and purchased this dvd sight unseen because it seemed to ooze of excellent epic BBC storytelling and visual feasting . However , I was only partially correct . It is excellently produced and beautiful to behold but the story is depressing and even a bit silly . I left the film feeling robbed , disappointed , sad , and a bit unfulfilled . I viewed it only once and then sold it on e - bay at a cut - rate price .

56740,4,"Coyote Ugly Alright : take a step back , and tell me there is n't something decidedly wrong , even militantly spooky , about the American Southwest . You know what I 'm talking about ? No ? Let me clarify , then . We're driving , Me Thee , across some barren stretch of ancient Arizona moonscape , and we 've hit upon what I call the Magic Hour : when the Day is laying down its sword in honor of Old Man Night , and the setting sun is really firing up all those sleeping reds and oranges and deep , feral yellows , up on the rocks , the hills , the cliffs , the crags , the bluffs . Can you see it ? Can you hear the coyotes keening and wailing and hi - yi - kee - yi - ing away back up in some box canyon , where those black - rooted stunty trees wave their straggly , evil , twisted arms towards an absentee Heaven ? We still think of America as a young country , and maybe that 's just our innocence talking . Because this land is just as ancient as any trod by the African or Chinese , and ca n't you just smell the Terrible Old Blood - Secrets buried down under the Earth when you 're out on the high desert?Sure . As the town of Desperation 's former Sheriff ( former , in that he 's going through something of a --- ah , Midlife Crisis ) would say , Gosh , yes . The guts and sheer , pulpy , bloody visceral glory of Stephen King 's novel "" Desperation "" rides that seam of ancient , buried , hulking horror like a 40-something housewife saddling up the mechanical bull at Gilley 's , and that 's half its charm --- which is why I was expecting so much with Mick Garris 's cinematic version , and , no doubt , why I was just so damned disappointed . The setup , the build , the execution --- everything about "" Desperation "" cuts thematically close to the territory King marked with his bad - doggie tale "" Cujo "" . Remember "" Cujo "" ? Something ancient and unspeakably evil , and deeply stupid and hungry --- something nasty lies all coiled - up in a dark cave . Until Cujo --- big , bumbling , naive , benevolent --- comes lumbering into its domain . And gets eaten . Devoured . Turned into a shambling , rabid hulk of its former lovable slobbery self , transformed into a ravenous engine of death with one single design : to spread carnage , red and raw and toothy , across the trembling land . Now , just as the arc and trajectory of the bullet is n't all that mindful of its casing , so too the unsleeping Ancient Evils of Cujo and Desperation are n't too picky about their corporeal hosts . Whether it 's a 300-pound dog or a 300-pound lawman , the only real concern is where to pile the bodies . Or so you 'd think . Sadly , "" Desperation "" is a tiny little bang , and a ton of whimper : 15 minutes of shivery brilliance , and what feels like about 8 hours of unbridled dullness . That bristling tale of ancient , sleeping , hungry Evil --- Tak ripped out of his slumber with the explosion of the charges in the Rattlesnake Pit , and his unquenchable desire to eat his way out into the guts of the little town of Desperation --- all of the novel 's frantic hardscrabble fight against a mounting , relentless Evil is wasted by Mick Garris 's listless , uninspired direction . It 's as if Garris burned up his budget hiring Ron Perlman to run the numbers as Collie Entragian , and then outsourced the rest of the flick to Bangalore . Hell , they even dragoon some worn - out mountain lion to take a chunk out of flabby old Charles Durning 's patooshka , and even that does n't jack up the Excite - O - Meter on this miserable thing . Not that I 'm complaining about Perlman : this sad little flick bumps and grinds and gets its Crawling Kingsnake groove - on * only * when Entragian is on the screen , and Perlman is the perfect choice as the Lawman who goes all Economy on us and squeezes both Good Cop * and * Bad Cop into one body , then goes on to Downsize his jurisdiction . With extreme prejudice . Tak ! "" Desperation "" has its 15 minutes of brilliance with that fatal traffic stop : everything is just about note perfect . Those lying , impossibly high wild - blue Western skies ; the Trooper lurching out of his cruiser , that Gary Cooper drawl just crackling out over the silence of the High Desert , the spike of Dread at the curt command to step out of the car succeeded by a queasy flood of relief when --- thank God!---it 's just a busted - tail - light . It 's here , in the seconds before "" Desperation "" lurches forward zombie - style into B - grade horror , that the movie succeeds , that it creeps and crawls the way the book did . It is here that the film conjures up the loneliness of the Vast Stretches , the realization --- something most American suburbanites go to their graves without knowing --- that there are wild spaces on this crazy planet where you could be murdered and buried without anyone knowing how , or why . While the coyotes howl , the scorpions scuttle and clatter , the black widows stalk and spin and move itchingly towards their prey . Gosh , yes .

56742,4,"If only she had gotten the stigmata sooner it would have been over quicker ! This review might contain some spoilers .... I was disappointed with this anime . After all the reviews I read I was expecting alot more .

56750,4,"Wonderful , , exhilarating "" psychoanalytic "" comedy Peter Sellers as well as Peter O'Toole and all the beautiful women : Capucine , Romy Schneider , etc , make ot his movie an extraordinary satire of the 60 's . Was really that world that mad ? Of course ! You could n't stand life without a psychonalist . Thus , the film reflects precisey that . The lack of self - confidence , the incapacity of accepting the values of that decade , till -happy ending , of course- O'Toole and Schneider get married and lived happily everafter . And everybody has surpassed their personal crises . Good for the movie . The humour is just wonderful .

56756,4,"horrible Do n't bother trying to watch this terrible mini series . It is a six hour bore , an unbelievable love triangle between three people who have absolutely no chemistry for each other . There is no heat in this story , no real passion , no real romance . It is a dry , boring , drawn out , and uninspired as they come . The writing is atrocious , and while the actors should be given credit for not choking on the swill they have for dialogue , they are completely unbelievable . The story is utterly predictable , though it goes off on pointless tangents and ignores potentially interesting subplots , and the only thing surprising is that anybody ever thought it would be a good idea to make this drivel . It does n't even meet the expected level of technical proficiency , with terrible editing , pathetic sound , and blatant continuity problems . Take those six hours of your life and use them for something more worthwhile .

I have never purchased a dvd set that was this bad in quality without it being pirated . Actually , I 've seen vhs copies with better audio / video quality . If I had not purchased the set from Amazon itself I would have thought , I did get a cheap bootleg . The sound is a bit flat , which I could deal get over , but the picture quality is just horrendous ! All of the episodes are grainy , pixilated , and some even blur a bit . There are whole episodes where the show is so dark you can hardly tell what is going on . It 's a waste of money to buy dvd 's like this . Shame on Fox for releasing them this bad!As for the show itself , well , it would be kind to say it was okay . In truth , it is not that great . I wonder how the show made it to season two at all . The acting was bad , the dialog was atrocious , the stories were subpar ; I could go on , but I think you get the idea . Usually , a shows first season is the best or at the least good enough to make you want to see the next run , but not this one . In short , DO NOT buy this set even if you are a fan .

56775,4,"Groden continues his Conspiracy Theories in Spite of Evidence to the Contrary Robert Groden suggests that the Zapruder film of the Kennedy Assassination has been tampered with to cover up the real killers of Kennedy . In my opinion , his "" evidence "" is shaky at best . Groden has made a lucrative living off of proposing alternative theories of who "" really "" shot Kennedy , and here he is in 2003 suggesting that there was a conspiracy to kill Kennedy despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary presented by ABC , CBS , and many books . Groden needs to finally realize that the Kennedy assassination has been solved definitively , and his continuation of conspiracy theories is clearly his lame and pathetic attempt to keep his money cash - cow alive . Do n't draw a conclusion based on this DVD ! Look at other sources listed below and then draw your conclusion:1 . ABC 's Peter Jennings presentation of the Kennedy Assassination ( available on Amazon.com ) clearly shows that Oswald was the one and only killer of JFK.2 . CBS 's Dan Rather 's special program on the Kennedy Assassination ( available on CBS website ) also suggests that the preponderence of the evidence points to Oswald as the lone killer . 3 . The book "" Case Closed "" , by Gerald Posner . He uses the physical evidence collected in Dallas , logic , and his ability to see through the fallicies of the conspiracies to show that Lee Oswald is the lone assassin . 4 . The book "" Marina and Lee "" , by Priscilla Johnson McMillian . This book shows that Oswald was certainly capable of the assassination , and the circumstances of his life point to the conclusion that he killed Kennedy . My advice is to watch this DVD first , and then look at the sources I list above , and then make an intelligent conclusion . If you are like me , you will see that Groden really has nothing solid to stand on .

56780,4,"A nice idea turned to utter drivel by an incompetent production team . Poor Lindsay Lohan - it seems between bad choices in films and even worse choices in real life , she may be about to destroy her career before it even takes off . As an actress , she is falling into some very rough waters where she is expected to carry films on her shoulders before she has even had a chance to mature in her craft . As a child actress , she was a natural fit for her spate of Disney appearances , with FREAKY FRIDAY her crowning achievment . However , as a young adult , the pressure is much higher , as is the bar of success . And movies like this are NOT helping . But to be fair , one can not place the blame on Ms. Lohan . The fact is , she has already had a turn in a non - Disney role which paid off exquisitely . MEAN GIRLS offered us the first glimpse of Lindsay in a post - Disney world . The timing was on , the interaction with the cast was superb , and everything just fell into place . But then again , that film also benefitted from a knockout script by a knockout writer ( Tina Fey ) . JUST MY LUCK has NONE of these things going for it . Perhaps ironically , Ms. Lohan 's latest vehicle is quite an unlucky choice for her . We have a promising premise in the concept of a boy and girl with opposing luck . Lohan is lucky , Chris Pine is not . Inevitably through the courses of movie magic , we know that the two will end up trading places ( much like Eddie Murphy and Dan Akroyd once did in . . . what was the name of that movie again ? ) The only mystery for the viewer is whether this will occur through a wise old Asian or a wise old Gypsy . ( Spoiler - it 's the gypsy ! OK , I know , I should n't be giving these things away ! ) Like I said , we all know this is going to happen . What we DIDN'T know was that it was going to take THIRTY - FIVE minutes to get there ! So , we kill one full third of the movie being bombarded with example after example of Lohan 's good luck and Pine 's bad luck . By the time they make the switch , I had already lost interest and was planning my lunch . After the predictable bout of sudden bad luck , Lohan learns that an ill - timed kiss with Mr. Pine was what caused the change of fortune . Problem is , the kiss was at a masquerade party , and she does n't know whom she kissed . What follows is perhaps the film 's only somewhat enjoyable sequence as Lohan tracks down and ambushes 20 strangers with sudden and embarassingly public kisses trying to get her luck back . Sadly , this brief bright spot ends too quickly , and it is back to the formula as Lohan and Pine meet and fall in love anyway , not knowing that they are the ones who caused each other 's luck to change . If predictable hook - ups make you happy , you might find some charm in this final third of the film - that is if you can overlook the sudden need for Lohan 's best friend to become a song - writer in what was obviously a "" what do we do with the final act ? "" tacked - on storyline with positively no set - up beforehand . The problem with this film is that it comes across as very "" slapped - together "" ( To borrow from Mad TV , it was "" JUST MADE IN TEN DAYS ) . Is the director to blame ? While Donald Petrie has a few hits to his name ( MISS CONGENIALTY , GRUMPY OLD MEN , and MYSTIC PIZZA ) he also has more than a few duds ( THE ASSOCIATE , WELCOME TO MOOSEPORT , MY FAVORITE MARTIAN ) . Or perhaps it is the writing team ? To date , the two credited writers have yet to muster up a single true hit , and one gets the sense that a more competent writing team would have taken a better direction with the plot and have not wasted the obvious talent that Ms. Lohan does in fact possess . Personally , I would have liked to have seen the producers take a risk and make Lohan a much more loathsome character to begin with than she is . Her character comes off as too nice to hate , and yet too shallow to root for . Whoever is to blame , this is clearly a sub - par effort at best , and one I hope Lindsay ( or her casting agent ) will learn from . With four movies coming down the pike , she still has a shot at transitioning into a much more serious career . I like that she has taken smaller ensemble roles recently ( such as PRAIRIE HOME COMPANION and BOBBY ) . A very smart play on her part .

56783,4,"Meanwhile , back in the 60s . This is just like an updated B movie from the sixties and I enjoyed it . It 's real comic book stuff . The effects are not bad , the pace hardly flags and the cast seem to be enjoying themselves so it 's easy viewing . I enjoyed this more than big budget films such as Evolution or Jurassic Park 3 . But I think the absence of big names will put people off , not that it matters because the cast here do a fine job .

56799,4,"Let me explain The reason the original "" Iron Chef "" was such an awesome show was entirely due to the bad translation and over the top voice acting . Therefore , without these elements , it becomes a pathetic charade of the original program . I was , at one time , a hardcore cult fan of "" Iron Chef "" because of the hilarious voice overs and true , foreign zest of Chairman Kaga and the gang . I really did n't care much for the cooking or whatever food was being prepared . The real heart of the show was the voiceovers and the mad , zesty zeal with which the Japanese chefs went over something as inane as cooking . I loved "" Iron Chef "" in much the same way as I loved the original "" Mystery Science Theater 3000 . "" They were both quirky tv cult shows that gave a certain sense of community among their hardcore fans . This new show really does n't cut it in any way , shape , or form . I 'm not being unpatriotic or anything , I 'm just saying why this new show is so weak . Also , I noticed that once the translators of the original show started figuring out the show was a huge hit , they ruined their own voiceacting by being all self concious . The original few seasons of the first "" Iron Chef "" are where it 's at ! Once again , I do n't watch this show for the cooking , I watch it for the odd , bizarre translations and cheesy voiceacting",278,0,0.19634769927365844,0.23669280032381002,0.0004347826086957031,0.0004347826086957031,0.0004347826086957031,0.07716940141949297,0.0004347826086957031,0.0004347826086957031,0.04500991900192022,0.0004347826086957031,0.0004347826086957031,0.0004347826086957031,0.0004347826086957031,0.0004347826086957031,0.0004347826086957031,0.0004347826086957031,0.0004347826086957031,0.0004347826086957031,0.0004347826086957031,0.0004347826086957031,0.0004347826086957031,0.13155730300900403,0.0004347826086957031,0.14107321628836486,0.0004347826086957031,0.0004347826086957031,0.0004347826086957031,0.0004347826086957031,0.0004347826086957031,0.0004347826086957031,0.0004347826086957031,0.0004347826086957031,0.0004347826086957031,0.0004347826086957031,0.0004347826086957031,0.0004347826086957031,0.0004347826086957031,0.0004347826086957031,0.11597459486190859,0.0004347826086957031,0.0004347826086957031,0.0004347826086957031,0.0004347826086957031,0.0004347826086957031,0.037914196256621326,0.0004347826086957031,0.0004347826086957031,0.0004347826086957031,0.0004347826086957031,0.0004347826086957031,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

I was expecting a scene where the child can be taken step by step on how to use the potty . this video did n't do it , so I 'm still in the search of a video that really enphasizes potty trainning .

Makes me wonder if this movie was crafted with apathy towards the subject , the audience and history instead of respect",142,0,0.0006451612903226506,0.0006451612903226506,0.060207172123703134,0.0006451612903226506,0.0006451612903226506,0.0006451612903226506,0.0006451612903226506,0.0006451612903226506,0.029781906601473025,0.0006451612903226506,0.0371381632539988,0.0006451612903226506,0.0006451612903226506,0.0006451612903226506,0.0006451612903226506,0.0006451612903226506,0.0006451612903226506,0.0006451612903226506,0.0006451612903226506,0.0006451612903226506,0.6768545569328355,0.0006451612903226506,0.0006451612903226506,0.0006451612903226506,0.0006451612903226506,0.0006451612903226506,0.0006451612903226506,0.0006451612903226506,0.0006451612903226506,0.0006451612903226506,0.0006451612903226506,0.033884805210215946,0.0006451612903226506,0.0006451612903226506,0.06974166050182855,0.0006451612903226506,0.0006451612903226506,0.0006451612903226506,0.0006451612903226506,0.0006451612903226506,0.06464979989207126,0.0006451612903226506,0.0006451612903226506,0.0006451612903226506,0.0006451612903226506,0.0006451612903226506,0.0006451612903226506,0.0006451612903226506,0.0006451612903226506,0.0006451612903226506,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

If parents truly wish for their off - spring to avoid blowing weed , they may not want to choose to show them this DVD.It 's SO hard to take seriously .

56860,4,"Total Bait and Switch From a big JT , Brit , and X - tina fan : This DVD is soooo disappointing . The DVD is comprised of whole episodes of MMC- and very little of the episodes has Britney , Justin , or Christina featured . There is only one song where Brit and Justin sing ( a duet ) , and only one where Christina sings . Other than that , all they basically show are lame "" hometown profiles "" which last about 60 seconds each . You get better content from a "" Behind the Music "" or "" Driven "" episode . There 's even some really heavy stuff about teens committing suicide that has absolutely NOTHING to do with Britney , Justin , or Christina . Lame , lame , lame , and disappointing . I think the total on - screen time of real content is about 12 minutes .

56879,4,"Subtexts On the surface this film is a pretty good courtroom drama . Underneath , however , the director seems to have a couple of other themes going . One thing that stood out to me is that the film is full of people who are "" caught between a rock and a hard place "" . Right from the start , where Childers has to choose between following the rules of war or saving his best friend . He has a similar choice on the wall in Yemin - fire into the crowd or let the attack on his people continue . I think he knew at that moment that his career was in the crapper . Jones ' character said as much during the trial : "" Whatever happens here , this man will never command marines again "" . The "" bad guy "" national security advisor was in a bind : do what is best for America 's interests or back up the colonel ? The ambassador had to make a hard choice : lie on the stand or lose his job , his status , his reputation ? Even his wife had to decide whether to tell the truth or stand behind her husband 's story . Biggs , the prosecutor , got caught up in it - he started out with the intent to prosecute what he was convinced was a legitimate case , then got tossed a ' hot potato ' by the NSA right in open court . Childers ' second - in - command , Captain Lee , had to decide whether to tell the truth or back his colonel . And so on . The court - martial itself seems to pit logic against emotion ( shades of Star Trek ! ) . The differences are clearest in the closing arguements - Biggs is the Joe Friday "" just the facts "" type ; he presents the panel with A. this happened , then B this happened , and so on . Hayes ' whole arguement is based on emotion - and then , finally , the jury is left with yet another hard decision . I found the movie very interesting in terms of what is going on with the characters - a lot of films are like this , if you look a little deeper , there 's more there than the surface story .",407,0,0.0003174603174603475,0.10350520346305625,0.0003174603174603475,0.0003174603174603475,0.0003174603174603475,0.0003174603174603475,0.0003174603174603475,0.07641962763481353,0.0003174603174603475,0.0003174603174603475,0.0003174603174603475,0.0003174603174603475,0.0003174603174603475,0.0003174603174603475,0.0003174603174603475,0.0003174603174603475,0.2086430161961531,0.0003174603174603475,0.0003174603174603475,0.0003174603174603475,0.0003174603174603475,0.10413976926481146,0.0003174603174603475,0.0003174603174603475,0.0003174603174603475,0.0003174603174603475,0.0003174603174603475,0.0003174603174603475,0.0003174603174603475,0.0003174603174603475,0.0003174603174603475,0.016962641423571703,0.0003174603174603475,0.0003174603174603475,0.0003174603174603475,0.0003174603174603475,0.0003174603174603475,0.0003174603174603475,0.0003174603174603475,0.0003174603174603475,0.0003174603174603475,0.0003174603174603475,0.041886989321384,0.23187221870332445,0.08266770269586754,0.12088695828114367,0.0003174603174603475,0.0003174603174603475,0.0003174603174603475,0.0003174603174603475,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0
56891,4,"Bad casting , bad sets , bad costumes So disappointing . Hardly a dark / noir film , in my opinion . Just a proper Hollywood murder mystery .

Cora ( Lana ) does n't have a treacherous or naughty bone in her body , and she 's always costumed like a perfect fashion model , fingernail polish and all . Frank ( Garfield)is never lustful , never mean , never desperate . Always polite and decent . Not a gas station ( except for one pump that looks planted ) not a single oil can or wrench .

Hey , when is nt Henriksen a evil son of a bitatch ? Yancy Butler ( Drop Zone ) is Van Dammes love interest protecting her from the villains trying to kill him and Wilfrod Brimley ( TV 'S Walker , Texas Ranger ) plays Van Damme 's southern fried canjun Uncle who rides horses and shoots arrows with his bow while trotting off after his country house blows up . All in all , it does nt become the worst movie ever made , its only presence if the style John Woo brings to his action scenes ... his lingo in the art of which he creates .

The animation is almost all old and there are frequent times when the princess look like an animated statue with only their mouths moving , while their prince next to them really does look like a statue since he does n't move at all . - The Christmas themes are simply not well done with the video containing things that were more suited for Halloween than Christmas . The part where Belle almost drowns ( and would have certainly died of hypothermia ) is a good example of this , though not the only example .

56928,4,"Wake me when it 's over I was so bored by this film that I thought I might be missing some subtle French cultural context or emotional triggers that would make it interesting . I asked a younger , French , female friend , who said she found it at least as boring as I did . The characters did n't engage my sympathy . Nothing explained why these people were even remotely interested in each other , so I did n't care what happened to them . Scenes like long car drives from the marriage bed to a first infidelity did n't build any dramatic tension or advance a plot or provide any interesting insight into the characters themselves . The sex scenes were banal and the bondage episodes in particular laughable . I sat through to the end , thinking there might perhaps be some breathtaking ending to redeem the wasted minutes .

It seems to be riding on it 's laurels , so to speak , and it 's almost as if we are supposed to find the characters acting differently funny .

From the beginning , when Katharine Hepburn 's character destroys other people 's cars without a care , we found one scene after another tedious and unfunny . The acting is fine , as could be expected from such greats as Hepburn and Cary Grant . But the characters are not sympathetic , fun or interesting . Grant 's character is an unassertive , spineless person who is easily dominated . Hepburn 's character is blindly selfish . Who could care what happens to them ?

56953,4,"One of Clint 's Worst Movies The Gauntlet may rank as one of Clint Eastwood 's worst movies . It is so unrealistic and silly I frankly did n't want to even finish it . Released in 1977 after a string of some really good westerns and Dirty Harry movies , it stands out as being a real stinker . Here Eastwood plays a loser of a cop , Ben Shockley , who is sent on an assignment to pick up a witness in Las Vegas for a trial . He 's told it 's a "" nothing witness for a nothing case "" so he thinks it 'll be an easy assignment . Well , poor Shockley finds out differently when not only the bad guys but the good guys are trying to kill him and his witness . It seems some conspiracy is afoot . The rest of the movie is Shockley , and his female witness , Gus Mally , running from cops and mobsters trying to kill them in increasingly ridiculous bad action scenes . And plot is so ludicrously predictable it 's pretty clear early on just who the bad guy behind the curtain is . Unless you really , really like Clint Eastwood , this is one to forget .

Imagine my surprise , then , when virtually all of this DVD is just the highlights of the others ( Classic Ernie , Bert and the beloved Mr. Hooper from Christmas Eve , Hanukkah from Happy Holidays , and Bob singing "" All though the Year "" from Elmo Saves Christmas "" among others ) . The only new part is Christmas future and it is a poor cartoon instead of new muppet footage . If you do n't have the other three DVDs this would probably earn 4 stars .

57001,4,"Skip Color , Go Directly To The Black - And - White I 'm not sure why Sony , which now owns I Dream of Jeannie , decided to colorize the first season of this series . Whatever the reason , you can readily tell by looking at the prices here on Amazon.com that the original black - and - white version of the first season is worth a lot more . The reason for that is simple -- I Dream of Jeannie was originally broadcast in black - and - white . And for a television fan like myself , that 's the ONLY way to watch the first season . The episodes themselves are just as I remember seeing them . Since I was n't around in 1965 , I 'm pretty sure I 've never seen these without the cuts that have been referenced here . But to me , they 're still pretty good . The theme music , in my opinion , is every bit as good as the second theme , introduced when Jeannie went to color in 1966 . The one thing that truly will drive the purists nuts is the fact that Sony stripped off the old Screen Gems animation from the end of every episode . That logo was attached to so many classic shows from the 1960s and 1970s , and it is consistenly rated , along with Viacom 's old blue V of Doom , as the scariest logo in the history of television . The new Sony outro does n't pack the same punch . Still , if you liked Jeannie way back when , you 'll love it now , especially since you can watch it anytime you like , without commercial interruption",296,1,0.0003125000000000257,0.0003125000000000257,0.0003125000000000257,0.0003125000000000257,0.0003125000000000257,0.0003125000000000257,0.0003125000000000257,0.0003125000000000257,0.06835436679136116,0.0003125000000000257,0.0003125000000000257,0.0003125000000000257,0.19614582988032517,0.0003125000000000257,0.0003125000000000257,0.0003125000000000257,0.0003125000000000257,0.0003125000000000257,0.0003125000000000257,0.0003125000000000257,0.0003125000000000257,0.24920648062647502,0.0003125000000000257,0.10587678237036297,0.0003125000000000257,0.019728579638465756,0.0003125000000000257,0.0003125000000000257,0.01485200141125511,0.020059088625926227,0.0003125000000000257,0.0159375000002532,0.0003125000000000257,0.0003125000000000257,0.0003125000000000257,0.19086786586811225,0.0003125000000000257,0.0003125000000000257,0.0003125000000000257,0.0003125000000000257,0.0003125000000000257,0.01600411930196738,0.0003125000000000257,0.0003125000000000257,0.0907798854854948,0.0003125000000000257,0.0003125000000000257,0.0003125000000000257,0.0003125000000000257,0.0003125000000000257,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0
57008,4,"Great reference I wanted to do a grad school paper on something I was interested in researching and I picked Hip - Hop . After working for an underground Hip - Hop magazine , I 'd already familiarized myself with a lot of information that I was too young to understand ( being born in ' 81 ) . I visited the University of Hip - Hop in Chicago , interviewed underground artists , and went to breaking shows in the Illinois area . Although I thought I was very familiar with Hip - Hop , after working with this magazine , I realized I knew NOTHING.So when I was given the chance to do my research paper , I knew that I would be able to learn even more than I already knew from working for the magazine . I watched the three parts of "" Beef "" first and saw an ad for this movie in the Extras section . Honestly , the first thing that caught my eye was how gorgeous Mr. Wiggles was ... but then after fully watching the preview , I realized this was the PERFECT movie for me to find out more about breaking . This movie documented the founding members , discussed the four elements of Hip - Hop , gave a lot of background information on Kool Herc and Grandmaster Flash , talked about the different techniques in breaking , the label "" breakdancing , "" the media 's dilution of breaking , the first movies that breaking was showcased in , new breaking groups ... just a bunch of "" firsts . "" It was a great reference for my paper , I enjoyed watching it , and I could watch it over and over again . I have a lot of respect for the founders because without them , headz would n't have this beautiful culture to express ourselves physically , mentally , and verbally",326,1,0.000500000000000051,0.000500000000000051,0.000500000000000051,0.000500000000000051,0.08112032014091326,0.000500000000000051,0.000500000000000051,0.000500000000000051,0.000500000000000051,0.000500000000000051,0.000500000000000051,0.000500000000000051,0.000500000000000051,0.000500000000000051,0.000500000000000051,0.000500000000000051,0.000500000000000051,0.000500000000000051,0.000500000000000051,0.000500000000000051,0.410277462393218,0.1439102889964591,0.000500000000000051,0.000500000000000051,0.000500000000000051,0.03332295662961042,0.000500000000000051,0.000500000000000051,0.000500000000000051,0.000500000000000051,0.000500000000000051,0.033967861901086686,0.000500000000000051,0.000500000000000051,0.000500000000000051,0.000500000000000051,0.000500000000000051,0.000500000000000051,0.000500000000000051,0.000500000000000051,0.000500000000000051,0.000500000000000051,0.000500000000000051,0.000500000000000051,0.000500000000000051,0.2754011099387101,0.000500000000000051,0.000500000000000051,0.000500000000000051,0.000500000000000051,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

57020,4,"Great ocean shots in the Bahamas I grabbed this flick from the shelf on a very wet and miserable day at my local Target .... craving the Summer sun and needing an island vacation .... The cover appealled to me for these reasons and I admit I was not at all disappointed in the movie . The scenery was indeed spectacular . The underwater diving / snorkling scenes were clear , crisp , and just what the doctor ordered . Even the sharks and rays made it all quite beautiful . OK , enough of the shallow stuff .... the movie was indeed much like the 70 's flick "" The Deep "" which I enjoyed back then as well . The characters of Jared and Sam were pretty believable - poor , honest , and happy folks ( most of us would love to really be this happy - let 's face it ! ) The introduction of Bryce ( played by Scott Caan ) really created an interesting balance of characters and how each reacted to the many dangers , twists , etc . Overall , the bikinis and the buff guys added to the adventure many of us would love to have in our generally boring lives . Would I want to deal with Tiger Sharks ? No , but a little excitement would beat the heck out of my boring 9 - 5 job every day .",241,1,0.0005000000000000447,0.0005000000000000447,0.02659719143637715,0.0005000000000000447,0.052085177318332364,0.0005000000000000447,0.0005000000000000447,0.0005000000000000447,0.0005000000000000447,0.0005000000000000447,0.02915118352170748,0.0005000000000000447,0.0005000000000000447,0.0005000000000000447,0.0005000000000000447,0.0005000000000000447,0.0005000000000000447,0.0005000000000000447,0.0005000000000000447,0.0005000000000000447,0.07650559109998233,0.39311786674919974,0.0005000000000000447,0.0005000000000000447,0.05260208658265071,0.12663245428228517,0.0005000000000000447,0.0005000000000000447,0.0005000000000000447,0.0005000000000000447,0.0005000000000000447,0.0005000000000000447,0.0005000000000000447,0.0005000000000000447,0.11894423044465653,0.0005000000000000447,0.0005000000000000447,0.0005000000000000447,0.10386421856480677,0.0005000000000000447,0.0005000000000000447,0.0005000000000000447,0.0005000000000000447,0.0005000000000000447,0.0005000000000000447,0.0005000000000000447,0.0005000000000000447,0.0005000000000000447,0.0005000000000000447,0.0005000000000000447,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
57029,4,"Wants , Needs , and Accessibility JULIE JOHNSON is a quiet little film that deals with the frustrations facing a New Jersey housewife and mother who married and birthed before she graduated high school and finds herself in a rigid relationship , longing for knowledge to change things . She considers herself stupid , sneaks Science magazines to read when her overbearing husband is n't around , and finally gathers the courage ( while staring at the stars one night ) to change her plight . She takes a computer course , passes her GED and with the constant support of her dearest girlfriend gathers the courage to get out of the stifling marriage with her husband and study to improve her lot in life . Along the way she discovers other secrets about herself , buried in the facade of a life she has led . She changes , relates to the world in a different way , and refuses to settle for returning to ' the old life ' when her husband returns promising her change . Her relationship with her girlfriend proceeds to intimate levels , but in the end this friendship can not last , as her girlfriend does n't have the same goals . The story is simple , but in the hands of the writers Wendy Hammond and Bob Gosse and with Gosse 's fine direction , the entire cast gives us an ensemble of disparate characters in whom we can all believe . Lili Taylor plays the lead with extraordinary skill and as her girlfriend Courtney Love gives a bravura performance . The remainder of the cast ( Spalding Gray , Noah Emmerich , Gideon Jacobs , Mischa Barton , et al ) is likewise strong . But it is Taylor 's film and she offers one of her most poignant performances of her career . A thoughtful , sensitive , engrossing film .

57057,4,"Oh , the things this kid does ... Ferris Bueller ( Matthew Broderick ) is a kind of hero to every high - school aged young adult out there . He 's the kind of guy whom we all want to be , really . He acts like he does n't have a care in the world , and lives life to fullest . The opposite of this guy would be his best friend Cameron Frye ( Alan Ruck ) , a sort of uptight worrywart who deserves to be brought out of his shell by the easygoing Ferris . In this film , Ferris fakes out his parents into calling it another "" sick "" day for him , his ninth to be exact . In order to convince just about everyone that he is really sick , he consults his collection of electronic sound effect equipment for the process . Another antithesis of Ferris is his life - is - not - fair sister Jeannie(Jennifer Grey ) who suspects something is up , as does the sly - but - not - so - slick Dean of Students , Ed Rooney ( Jeffrey Jones).It 's funny how so many trains of thoughts seem to dominate this movie and in the events that happen For instance , Ferris says that he has to keep coming up with new illnesses in order to make 10 sick days . It 's amazing ; people , like his parents who are most easily duped , would think that this one sick kid when in reality , he 's having a ball . However , knowing that if he gets cauught and may not graduate , he decides to make this one count and be worthwhile . Ferris and Cameron bail out Ferris ' girl Sloane ( Mia Sara ) with a dead grandmother ploy , and together the trio spend the day doing the town in Chicago driving the ' 61 GT convertible ( Oh , yeah ! ) . This movie has a special message and feeling to it that 's as old as time . It 's about conquering fears mostly and just really appreciating life . For after all , as our hero says : "" Life moves pretty fast ; if you do n't stop to take a look every once in a while , you might miss it . "" That 's the moral of the story , really . "" Bueller ... Bueller ... Bueller ? "" Not here , but he 'll be there in your own home sharing his funny but wise philosophies of life , and showing you how to open your eyes in making the most of every day",457,1,0.1954290297898653,0.00026315789473686617,0.00026315789473686617,0.00026315789473686617,0.00026315789473686617,0.00026315789473686617,0.02674733813520964,0.16188954981960185,0.00026315789473686617,0.00026315789473686617,0.00026315789473686617,0.00026315789473686617,0.14241825295203625,0.00026315789473686617,0.00026315789473686617,0.00026315789473686617,0.00026315789473686617,0.00026315789473686617,0.00026315789473686617,0.00026315789473686617,0.36345450648317845,0.00026315789473686617,0.00026315789473686617,0.00026315789473686617,0.00026315789473686617,0.03289347922447893,0.00026315789473686617,0.00026315789473686617,0.013703922441771718,0.00026315789473686617,0.00026315789473686617,0.00026315789473686617,0.00026315789473686617,0.00026315789473686617,0.023840825540250226,0.013883942671255289,0.00026315789473686617,0.00026315789473686617,0.00026315789473686617,0.00026315789473686617,0.00026315789473686617,0.00026315789473686617,0.015212837152877886,0.00026315789473686617,0.00026315789473686617,0.00026315789473686617,0.00026315789473686617,0.00026315789473686617,0.00026315789473686617,0.00026315789473686617,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
57062,4,"cutting edge comedy Nothing quite like this show for the writing and character talent . Every one of the major players in the series has a talent for overacting that even William Shatner would envy , and even without the writing the facial expressions and delivery are frequently close to hysterical . As anybody who has seen this show knows , the writing is very original and energetic but is able to transition seamlessly into double - entendre and innuendo with a cleverness usually reserved for British comedy . ( Although , as "" children "" of the Three Stooges , Americans are , I think , accustomed to somewhat heavier - handed comedy.)For those who do n't know this series , it definitely is too bawdy to watch with kids ( I would n't let mine watch with me until they are at least 20 , by which time they will probably find this material boring ) . If you are assembling a comedy collection , however , this series fills a unique niche . My only complaint is that the packaging is a bit second rate . It does n't even come in a box , but rather in a little "" accordion - folder "" package which is neither aesthetic nor practical ( ca n't stack ) nor particularly protective . It is also hard to remove the disks from the center catches without damaging them ( I chipped one first thing out of the box despite expecting trouble , but fixed with carefully trimmed packaging tape ; works fine )",264,1,0.00041666666666671337,0.11997539600833666,0.024754978688500757,0.00041666666666671337,0.00041666666666671337,0.021485661236589397,0.00041666666666671337,0.00041666666666671337,0.00041666666666671337,0.00041666666666671337,0.00041666666666671337,0.00041666666666671337,0.00041666666666671337,0.00041666666666671337,0.00041666666666671337,0.00041666666666671337,0.00041666666666671337,0.00041666666666671337,0.021250000000000546,0.00041666666666671337,0.3758071101247997,0.09750799703390896,0.00041666666666671337,0.14976481067698846,0.00041666666666671337,0.00041666666666671337,0.05354813067906975,0.00041666666666671337,0.00041666666666671337,0.028412663997012456,0.00041666666666671337,0.00041666666666671337,0.00041666666666671337,0.00041666666666671337,0.0280233066960051,0.0230917191324556,0.00041666666666671337,0.00041666666666671337,0.04054489239299743,0.00041666666666671337,0.00041666666666671337,0.00041666666666671337,0.00041666666666671337,0.00041666666666671337,0.00041666666666671337,0.00041666666666671337,0.00041666666666671337,0.00041666666666671337,0.00041666666666671337,0.00041666666666671337,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

57071,4,"Everybody has a "" Madea "" in his / her family ! I 'll admit that I 'm a Johnny - come - lately to the "" Madea "" series , finally seeing this compilation at the insistence of my teenaged niece . Creator Tyler Perry and his alter - ego , the opinionated , pistol - packing , chain - smoking ( never lit , by the way ) "" Madea , "" have starred in several successful stage plays and subsequent theatrical film versions to the delight of fans , mostly African - American , nationwide . Though the stories feature the tried - and - true clich � d characters ( the belligerent teenager , the devoted wife , the straying husband , the vixens , the lotharios , etc . ) and situations ( infidelity , promiscuity , straying from the church , comedic funerals , obnoxious and overbearing family members ) , Perry 's productions also introduce a bit of spirituality with each story 's ending dependent upon DIVINE INTERVENTION making things right . Some of the acting performances are a little over the top , and the musical selections , though sung with gusto and relish by the gifted vocalists , are weak in the lyrics department ; however , as a whole , the respective productions are entertaining and inspirational . Perry has tapped into a market that is unconsciously ignored by Hollywood , and is having great success on both the stage and screen .

57102,4,"Best 3D IMAX Film "" Haunted Castle "" and "" Alien Adventure "" are great , but the concept and dimensional enjoyment of "" Encounter in the Third Dimension "" makes it better than the other two . The film is an excellent way of showing how 3D started and how it works with lots of prime examples thrown in , other than the entire movie itself . I do wish the mine ride was longer though ( the one which ends with the big , round , stone ball slamming into the tunnel ) and there was more shown of the T3 Experience . Sure , the Jules Verne "" Journey to the Center of the Earth "" ride certainly makes up for it , but the effects in the shorter example were awesome , like the bats . Best of all , the film does n't look all that dated CGI wise for a 1998 production . Now I 've definitely got to get the sequel "" Misadventures in 3D "" DVD . Noticed something stupid in the credits for "" Encounter "" . Instead of saying "" Cassandra Peterson as Elvira , Mistress of the Dark "" , it redundantly reads , "" Elvira as Elvira , Mistress of the Dark "" . Unlike the other 3D IMAX films , this one is good either in stereo depth form or 2D wise . Of course , the best is 3D since that is the whole point of the story anyway . I highly recommend this movie to all 3D collectors",263,1,0.0004347826086956919,0.0004347826086956919,0.0004347826086956919,0.0004347826086956919,0.0004347826086956919,0.0004347826086956919,0.03343888269611653,0.0004347826086956919,0.12412767254585605,0.0004347826086956919,0.0004347826086956919,0.045677287840357725,0.0004347826086956919,0.0004347826086956919,0.0004347826086956919,0.0004347826086956919,0.0004347826086956919,0.09429966954014209,0.0004347826086956919,0.0004347826086956919,0.29243306960854554,0.0004347826086956919,0.0004347826086956919,0.0004347826086956919,0.0004347826086956919,0.0004347826086956919,0.0004347826086956919,0.0004347826086956919,0.0004347826086956919,0.0504675658786107,0.0004347826086956919,0.0004347826086956919,0.0004347826086956919,0.0004347826086956919,0.0004347826086956919,0.0004347826086956919,0.0004347826086956919,0.0004347826086956919,0.0004347826086956919,0.0004347826086956919,0.0004347826086956919,0.0004347826086956919,0.0004347826086956919,0.22760566434827637,0.1136893179768759,0.0004347826086956919,0.0004347826086956919,0.0004347826086956919,0.0004347826086956919,0.0004347826086956919,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0

He constantly runs into a trio of outlawish justice seekers . They do what is called "" committing "" someone for their sins .

57133,4,"Aeria Gloris , Aeria Gloris Once again the saga of Motoko Kusanagi refuses to fall into the popular mold - as manga , as a pair of feature films , and now a TV series , it combines the classic crowd pleasers of the science fiction of a not too distant time , a topnotch group of secret agents , and a beautiful woman with a story line that is n't fraid to stop and contemplate the complicated world where the line between mechanical and human , program and soul , get crossed every day . What you will see for most of these last few episodes is the dismantling of Section 9 when their efforts to get to the bottom of the Secretary General 's plot result in danger to the nations politicians . This invites retaliation and everyone goes undercover and , eventually , fall into the governments hands . All the Laughing Man 's efforts seem to come to naught and theire is every sign that this series is about to have a very nourish ending . Well , all I 'll tell you is that the ending is worth all the trauma of getting there . These three episodes really focus on the characters of the Section 9 team in unexpected fashion . And even the Tachikoma 's make a reappearance . This has been a contemplative series . First the ethical questions raised by the Laughing Man and human cyberization , then the even more difficult issues of what life is or can be . In these episodes Kusanagi reveals a personal philosophy which is both chilling and evocative of the samurai code . She is a modern Tomoe Gozen , unendingly loyal to Arimaki and fiercely defiant in battle .

57137,4,"There is something tragic about being 50 ( recommended ) SUNSET BOULEVARD is a drama that reveals the unsightly day - to - day world of forgotten and upcoming actors behind the pomp pretense . Joe Gillis ( William Holden ) , a writer running from a pair of automobile repossessers , holds up in the garage of an apparently abandoned mansion on Sunset Boulevard . While walking around the dilapidated structures and evaporated pool , he is shocked to discover it 's occupied by old silent - film star Norma Desmond ( Gloria Swanson ) . Living with a devoted chauffeur , estranged from Hollywood and forgotten by fans , in Desmond 's mind , she is still a star working on her next big roll in a script she has been scribbling for years . Knowing the script does n't have a chance , as a writer , Joe looks at this as an opportunity to "" fine tune "" it to earn some extra cash . However , the working relationship is not all that tidy . It seems lonely Desmond is looking to sponsor a gigolo . His payment is a warm place to stay at night , a closet full of clothes , nice meals , private "" parties , "" and Desmond 's ever - present company . If it were possible for Desmond 's self - admiration to be supplanted by anything , it would be the possessiveness for Joe 's affection . Young Joe needs a break from such austere surroundings and eventually goes out to a party with real people and meets a girl engaged to an old friend . Through a series of secret rendezvous they begin to collaborate on a script with real potential and , naturally , develop feelings for one another . The girl may be willing to sacrifice her engagement but breaking free from the tentacles on SUNSET BOULEVARD is a formidable challenge . With some of the most memorable quotes in Hollywod , this is a wonderfully produced "" noir - comic "" drama by Billy Wilder that well projects the intense emotions , not only of each character , but of the large group of people in the entertainment industry they represent . Other highly acclaimed movies that fit in with this genre are ALL ABOUT EVE , AN IMITATION OF LIFE , and WHAT EVER HAPPENED TO BABY JANE . A gem on the DVD extras is the history of fashion legend Edith Head . Movie quote : "" There 's nothing tragic about being fifty . Not unless you 're trying to be twenty - five .",445,1,0.0003389830508474932,0.10026387112087448,0.0003389830508474932,0.0003389830508474932,0.0003389830508474932,0.0003389830508474932,0.0003389830508474932,0.18142276511582955,0.0003389830508474932,0.0003389830508474932,0.0003389830508474932,0.03423728813559464,0.0003389830508474932,0.0003389830508474932,0.017567474170778394,0.0003389830508474932,0.0003389830508474932,0.013844471481922587,0.0003389830508474932,0.0003389830508474932,0.3006170543780532,0.0003389830508474932,0.0003389830508474932,0.07876565744102995,0.02914301967799505,0.0003389830508474932,0.0003389830508474932,0.0003389830508474932,0.0003389830508474932,0.054464848932164335,0.0003389830508474932,0.013748268715644633,0.0003389830508474932,0.0003389830508474932,0.0003389830508474932,0.0003389830508474932,0.0003389830508474932,0.0003389830508474932,0.01910441570807803,0.0003389830508474932,0.0003389830508474932,0.0003389830508474932,0.0003389830508474932,0.06443927157470625,0.0003389830508474932,0.07983922066597159,0.0003389830508474932,0.0003389830508474932,0.0003389830508474932,0.0003389830508474932,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0

57173,4,"Terrific portrait of life confronted with death At Ikiru 's opening , I started to have real doubts about the film . I had heard that this was Kurosawa 's best , and the film was built up just enough to come crashing down . Luckily , that did n't happen . The narrator of the film reminded me of Criswell 's narrations to Plan 9 from Outer Space . The film seemed to say too much and show too little . Then as the narrator continued during an extremely long take of our hero Mr. Watanabe at work , something clicked . The long duration of the shot and the narrator 's continued breakdown of the man 's less wholesome characteristics gave the impression that he was breaking down our lives , that the narration is coming from the back of our own minds , and that we are powerless to silence it . That floored me , and for the rest of the film , I remained awe - stricken by this humble yet miserable man . Takashi Shimura gives one of the greatest performances I 've seen since Raging Bull . Here is a guy whose really pissed off at the world , but he 's smart enough to know he has only himself to blame for the mediocrity his life has been dealt . The horror on his face when he learns of his cancer will remain with me for a long time . There are points at which the film seems to drag on , but never without purpose . When he dies , having finally given meaning to his existence , his coworkers and family members recount the final days with pity , confusion , and finally admiration . The scene lags , which makes us that much more insulted by their ignorance",309,1,0.00037735849056607415,0.00037735849056607415,0.00037735849056607415,0.00037735849056607415,0.023545423694022953,0.00037735849056607415,0.00037735849056607415,0.22929866707784086,0.00037735849056607415,0.00037735849056607415,0.00037735849056607415,0.00037735849056607415,0.00037735849056607415,0.00037735849056607415,0.00037735849056607415,0.00037735849056607415,0.00037735849056607415,0.00037735849056607415,0.00037735849056607415,0.00037735849056607415,0.03840707440389984,0.00037735849056607415,0.00037735849056607415,0.00037735849056607415,0.00037735849056607415,0.00037735849056607415,0.00037735849056607415,0.00037735849056607415,0.00037735849056607415,0.00037735849056607415,0.00037735849056607415,0.01973323081264643,0.00037735849056607415,0.00037735849056607415,0.00037735849056607415,0.00037735849056607415,0.00037735849056607415,0.00037735849056607415,0.00037735849056607415,0.00037735849056607415,0.00037735849056607415,0.00037735849056607415,0.00037735849056607415,0.46956711352907543,0.13498087949873094,0.06824119588944218,0.00037735849056607415,0.00037735849056607415,0.00037735849056607415,0.00037735849056607415,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0

57188,4,"I see that "" I Heart the Huckabees "" is meant for a selective audience . This movie is obviously not for everyone . It 's not a comedy that you just put in and sit back and be shut down the old cranium for the two plus hour 's . Nope , instead you get the muscle a - cranking . Huckabees requires you to really pay attention and think and take everything in . This film explores several questions mainly dealing with the connection between one person and to the heart , soul , and body of every other thing in existence in an ever - changing world . This film is a big orgy of questioning . And who does n't like questioning ? This film , in its own right , is very original and thought provoking that goes above and beyond any form of typicality of films . ""Huckabees "" offers us an impressive cast with Dustin Hoffman , Lily Tomlin , Jason Schwartzman , Jude Law , Mark Wahlberg , Isabelle Huppert ( one of my favorite international actress 's ) and Naomi Watts . Most notable performances by , namely , Dustin Hoffman as it 's nice to see him in an exceptional role . He has n't really been given a great script and chance to portray a great character since probably 1997 's "" Wag the Dog . "" It 's very nice to see Hoffman play a great character , as Bernard , the quirky husband half of the existential detectives . Also , most notable is the performance of Mark Wahlberg , as Tommy Corn , another client of the detectives that befriends Albert . Tommy is a fire fighter who has his own environmental concerns as he refuses to ride on the fire truck and rather , rides a bike to the fire saying , "" We 'd all be heroes if we stopped using petroleum . "" Mark Wahlberg is hilarious in this movie and has his best performance since probably "" Boogie Nights "" and "" Three Kings . "" However , this movie is much more of an ensemble performance than anything else . The ensemble 's performance in this film is terrific and the chemistry between each character is flawless . The most credit to this movie goes to writer / director David O. Russell . Russell has obviously something going on up there in the cabeza to extract such a story . But the story is amazingly written . The script is out of the ordinary yet genius and comes out as one of the most intelligent films out there and hilarious at that .",452,1,0.00028985507246379413,0.038109410100067846,0.00028985507246379413,0.00028985507246379413,0.040488643808181485,0.00028985507246379413,0.00028985507246379413,0.00028985507246379413,0.00028985507246379413,0.00028985507246379413,0.00028985507246379413,0.00028985507246379413,0.00028985507246379413,0.00028985507246379413,0.014738712601939166,0.00028985507246379413,0.00028985507246379413,0.00028985507246379413,0.00028985507246379413,0.00028985507246379413,0.5023722488445018,0.00028985507246379413,0.00028985507246379413,0.00028985507246379413,0.00028985507246379413,0.00028985507246379413,0.00028985507246379413,0.00028985507246379413,0.00028985507246379413,0.00028985507246379413,0.00028985507246379413,0.00028985507246379413,0.07974010922121533,0.00028985507246379413,0.00028985507246379413,0.00028985507246379413,0.00028985507246379413,0.00028985507246379413,0.00028985507246379413,0.00028985507246379413,0.00028985507246379413,0.00028985507246379413,0.00028985507246379413,0.31179725223568727,0.00028985507246379413,0.00028985507246379413,0.00028985507246379413,0.00028985507246379413,0.00028985507246379413,0.00028985507246379413,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

57190,4,"arrested development is back for more One thing about Arrested Development that I forgot to mention in my previous review is how the humor holds up nicely over the years . What I found funny last year when I was watching the show is JUST as consistently funny now . In fact , now that I understand the style of humor better , I think the show is even funnier now . Fox had something good cooking with Arrested Development . It seems whenever a show does n't get the ratings a network wants , a network will move the show to another night and timeslot in the hope of achieving better ratings . It VERY rarely works , and sadly Arrested Development is another example of this . I ca n't blame Fox for pulling the plug . After all , they tried their hardest to promote the show . I remember Sunday nights watching the Simpsons and during the commercials the people at Fox REALLY wanted viewers to tune in . The writers of the show should be proud that Fox tried very hard to keep it on the air . It 's just unfortunate people did n't want to watch it . I still believe if more people were willing to pay attention to the characters on the show and made a solid effort to get involved in the twisted storylines instead of assuming the show should be like a regular laugh track comedy , Arrested Development would be around today . As it stands , 53 episodes are all we have of this great show . Honestly , it 's not enough , but will have to do . Do we really NEED anymore laugh track comedies ? Are n't there more than enough of them on the air now ? Most of these shows people wo n't even recognize when they hear the name of them because there 's so many . Most comedies that feature a laughing audience are exactly the same , and they blend together . One plainly obvious joke after another . I 'm bored just thinking about it . We 've reached a time when television has changed with all sorts of reality shows and whatnot , and changing the format of the comedy genre to a direction similar to Arrested Development is the right move , in my opinion . The times need to change . People make a big deal about Arrested Development because there 's really NOTHING else like it on television . That 's why the show deserves all the 5-star ratings it has received here on amazon . People would n't be praising the show so much if there was n't a good reason for it . Trust me , there 's a reason for all the positive reviews . Buy one of the DVD season sets , pop a bag of popcorn in the microwave , watch the show * carefully * and experience the joy so many people are raving about .",509,1,0.00022727272727274906,0.01955112555221338,0.00022727272727274906,0.00022727272727274906,0.02035389886211789,0.00022727272727274906,0.00022727272727274906,0.18017635393767378,0.00022727272727274906,0.00022727272727274906,0.00022727272727274906,0.01169108750292183,0.2169897438124709,0.00022727272727274906,0.00022727272727274906,0.00022727272727274906,0.00022727272727274906,0.06402524473586152,0.00022727272727274906,0.00022727272727274906,0.3042800491300065,0.00022727272727274906,0.00022727272727274906,0.00022727272727274906,0.00022727272727274906,0.00022727272727274906,0.00022727272727274906,0.00022727272727274906,0.00022727272727274906,0.038948350546437686,0.00022727272727274906,0.00022727272727274906,0.00022727272727274906,0.00022727272727274906,0.00022727272727274906,0.029980742243207195,0.00022727272727274906,0.00022727272727274906,0.00022727272727274906,0.00022727272727274906,0.0470750471253821,0.00022727272727274906,0.00022727272727274906,0.00022727272727274906,0.05806472018807005,0.00022727272727274906,0.00022727272727274906,0.00022727272727274906,0.00022727272727274906,0.00022727272727274906,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

57194,4,"Teenaged Sexual Repression Captured Vividly by Kazan 's Sure Hand and Wood 's Best Onscreen Work In the same way he was able to extract a searing performance from Andy Griffith in 1957 's "" A Face in the Crowd "" , master director Elia Kazan gets similarly stellar results from Natalie Wood in this classic 1961 melodrama about youthful sexual repression in rural 1920 's Kansas . In the same year as her Maria in "" West Side Story "" , she has never been more affecting then she is here as Deanie Loomis , the local butcher 's daughter deeply in love with Bud Stamper , the son of an oil scion and the high school football hero . They are the senior sweethearts everyone expects to marry , but both have to battle constantly with their sexual longing and their grasping parents . The ruling moral code restricts Deanie more than Bud who ends up cavorting with a good - time girl named Juanita . The indiscretion overwhelms Deanie who attempts suicide and ends up in a sanitarium for her fragile mental state . A few years later with their lives on divergent paths , they meet again to come to terms with each other . While the whole film is beautifully executed thanks to Kazan 's sure hand and William Inge 's screenplay ( his first directly for the screen ) , it 's the last fifteen minutes that really resonate with the characters expressing their emotions with a minimum of dialogue . Otherwise , there are plenty of heated moments of melodrama along with soap opera elements familiar to anyone who has seen 1955 's "" Picnic "" based on Inge 's successful Broadway play . At her most beautiful , Wood is wondrous as she moves fluidly from innocently infatuated to obsessive to resigned . As the none - too - bright Bud , Warren Beatty is charismatic in his film debut and makes Deanie 's powerful fixation completely understandable . There are several standout performances among the supporting cast with Audrey Christie pitch - perfect as Deanie 's unsympathetic mother , Pat Hingle in blowhard mode as Bud 's power - hungry father , and Zohra Lampert as Angie , the self - effacing waitress Bud meets at Yale . The classic Wordsworth poem from which the film 's title is derived makes a fitting coda for this movie , and I still feel the intractable sense of longing in the two lead characters every time I see this movie . The 2001 DVD unfortunately has no extras",435,1,0.0003278688524590425,0.0003278688524590425,0.0003278688524590425,0.0003278688524590425,0.0003278688524590425,0.0003278688524590425,0.0003278688524590425,0.0003278688524590425,0.07305733848360324,0.0003278688524590425,0.0003278688524590425,0.0003278688524590425,0.0003278688524590425,0.0003278688524590425,0.0003278688524590425,0.0003278688524590425,0.06520304921321417,0.0003278688524590425,0.01671180930516986,0.0003278688524590425,0.11346938852667865,0.0003278688524590425,0.0003278688524590425,0.0003278688524590425,0.0003278688524590425,0.04905682717746344,0.028859972121910212,0.0003278688524590425,0.0003278688524590425,0.0003278688524590425,0.0003278688524590425,0.0003278688524590425,0.0003278688524590425,0.0003278688524590425,0.03398051924935177,0.0003278688524590425,0.0003278688524590425,0.0003278688524590425,0.0003278688524590425,0.0003278688524590425,0.023622780331938036,0.08415653248619648,0.0003278688524590425,0.4987670290061124,0.0003278688524590425,0.0003278688524590425,0.0003278688524590425,0.0003278688524590425,0.0003278688524590425,0.0003278688524590425,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

57205,4,"One of the best concert films . This excellent DVD gives us a remarkable version of Martin Scorsese 's film . It has been color corrected by Scorsese himself , and remastered for superior sound quality . The concert on Thanksgiving Day in 1976 was the final concert of The Band , with its original lineup . Numerous special musical guests enhanced the occasion . The Band were clearly at the top of their game that night , despite whatever personal tensions may have existed between them . Classic songs like "" Up on Cripple Creek "" , "" Stage Fright"",and "" They Night They Drove Old Dixie Down "" are given excellent rendtions . The guest stars seem to be having a good time , with backing by The Band themselves . Ronnie Hawkins does an outstanding "" Who Do You Love "" . Dr. John does his classic "" Such A Night "" . Joni Mitchell performs her underrated "" Coyote "" . A high - kickin ' Van Morrison rocks the house with "" Caravan "" . And blues legend Muddy Waters does a spectacular "" Mannish Boy "" . In a "" making of "" featurette , Scorsese says Waters ' perforance of this song was almost not filmed , because most of the cameras ran out of film . Fortunately , one cameraman caught the whole song , so we can have this excellent performance . Neil Young , Eric Clapton , and Bob Dylan are just some of the other performers in this outstanding lineup . Scorsese also provides excellent behind the scenes interviews with the members of The Band . The DVD also incudes two commentaries . One features Scorsese and Robbie Robertson , the other features Levon Helm , Garth Hudson , and guests stars Hawkins and Mavis Staples . They all have good stories to tell , and serve to enhance the film quite well . A previously unseen jam , and an eight page booklet written by Robertson round out the DVD . I highly reccomend this DVD to this classic film 's many fans",355,1,0.00030303030303033333,0.00030303030303033333,0.05084916183408552,0.00030303030303033333,0.00030303030303033333,0.00030303030303033333,0.017698610684040415,0.08690819628469904,0.0424731154497862,0.00030303030303033333,0.00030303030303033333,0.019212997402531184,0.00030303030303033333,0.00030303030303033333,0.00030303030303033333,0.00030303030303033333,0.00030303030303033333,0.0617904394551551,0.00030303030303033333,0.05420375430462159,0.00030303030303033333,0.00030303030303033333,0.00030303030303033333,0.00030303030303033333,0.019985860876845608,0.026107177348587,0.09628251122297164,0.00030303030303033333,0.01701453689727647,0.00030303030303033333,0.00030303030303033333,0.00030303030303033333,0.00030303030303033333,0.00030303030303033333,0.00030303030303033333,0.00030303030303033333,0.03507324735008831,0.00030303030303033333,0.1645406925239967,0.00030303030303033333,0.00030303030303033333,0.00030303030303033333,0.00030303030303033333,0.2803906738865345,0.00030303030303033333,0.00030303030303033333,0.016862963872719204,0.00030303030303033333,0.00030303030303033333,0.00030303030303033333,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0
57206,4,"Cradle Of Crime ! Welcome to the Lower East Side , where the high - rise apartments of the super - rich abut the tenements on the riverside . Here Joel McCrea , a poor would - be architect , is infatuated with rich girl Wendy Barrie , while poor girl Sylvia Sidney pines for him , all the while trying to save her younger brother from a life of crime on the streets . Into the scene strides Humphrey Bogart as a wanted killer , coming home to try to reconnect with his mother and an old flame . Intersecting with the adult storyline is that of the Dead End Kids ( in what would be the first of many screen appearances ) , of which Sidney 's brother is the leader . The film is based on a play , and boy can you tell . The studio set is deeply obvious as such , and the structure is too carefully symmetrical . The social symbolism is subtle as a sledgehammer , and the script is too caught up with being Worthy . Bogart 's performance is a striking one , however , and his character stands out as fully realized when compared to the walking Social Messages incarnated by Sidney and McCrea . The Dead End Kids ( also known as the East Side Kids , the Bowery Boys , and the Little Tough Guys ) would show again the following year in Angels with Dirty Faces , and viewing the two films together is instructive , showing , among other things , the difference between MGM 's gloss ( which sat uneasily on a gangster story ) and Warner 's far more convincing grit . The mono track is in good shape . The print is in pretty good shape , but there 's no hiding the fact that this is a film from 1937 . The trailer is here , and nothing else . The menu is basic . Once celebrated with Oscar nominations , this film now seems rather silly compared to the Warner gangster films of the same period . But it has a definite historical value , and certainly deserves its release",370,1,0.00040000000000004133,0.00040000000000004133,0.07727033975258911,0.00040000000000004133,0.00040000000000004133,0.06040005912237054,0.00040000000000004133,0.00040000000000004133,0.037200191387145524,0.00040000000000004133,0.00040000000000004133,0.00040000000000004133,0.00040000000000004133,0.00040000000000004133,0.00040000000000004133,0.00040000000000004133,0.08519059934035819,0.00040000000000004133,0.00040000000000004133,0.00040000000000004133,0.00040000000000004133,0.1407947226829668,0.00040000000000004133,0.033080361483287295,0.07822861025079558,0.030780830743038164,0.00040000000000004133,0.00040000000000004133,0.00040000000000004133,0.00040000000000004133,0.00040000000000004133,0.00040000000000004133,0.044763540783022374,0.00040000000000004133,0.08282012122823733,0.00040000000000004133,0.00040000000000004133,0.00040000000000004133,0.02214970075409949,0.00040000000000004133,0.00040000000000004133,0.02953595842537442,0.00040000000000004133,0.26298496404671357,0.00040000000000004133,0.00040000000000004133,0.00040000000000004133,0.00040000000000004133,0.00040000000000004133,0.00040000000000004133,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
57216,4,""" I 'm Gon na Be Like Joan Collins And You Ai nt Gon na Stop me ! "" I can not recall a time when I did not love this hilarious movie , which is my favourite from the 1980 's by far . The superb Bette Midler and Lily Tomlin enjoy a magical screen chemistry in "" Big Business"",that reminds me of some of the great comedy teams from Hollywood 's Golden Age . A total laugh feast from start to finish this film strangely does n't seem to have a high profile as comedies go however it is recommended viewing for anyone wanting a good old fashioned belly laugh and to see a comedy with probably the highest number of side splitting one liners in living memory . The premise of identical twins being mixed up at birth and meeting years later creating amusing complications is a tried and try formula for comedy however in "" Big Business "" , it is given a new freshness by the two leads who literally fly away with the material here creating an unforgettable romp that takes us from humble Jupitor Hollow to the height of New York 's business world . The story begins in a flash back when wealthy New Yorkers Hunt and Binky Shelton are passing through rural backwater Jupitor Hollow when Binky goes into labour . At the same time locals Garth and Iona Ratliff also are expecting and both women give birth at the same moment and both produce twins which are not only given the same names of Sadie and Rose but are also mixed up . We move forward forty years to where Sadie Shelton is the corporate head of Moramax that is wanting to off load its ownership of Holomade , the local industry in Jupitor Hollow . Getting wind of their plans the militant Jupitor Hollow resident Rose Ratliff decides to go fight these "" Pinstriped Trouser Snakes "" , on their own territory and Sadie eagerly follows along anxious to get out of boring Jupitor Hollow . Through a mix up they end up staying in the Plaza Hotel unknowingly right next door to their city twins where they discover such wonders as "" sinks in the living room "" , and "" soaps in the shapes of swans "" ! Complication piles on top of complication as Sadie Shelton 's ex husband Michael ( Barry Primus ) , ca n't believe the transformation when he mistakes the rural Sadie for his hard nosed wife and Jay Marshall(Michael Gross ) , ca n't for the life of him understand why Rose ( Ratliff ) is being so hostile towards him when he believes he is talking to demure Rose ( Shelton ) . All comes to a head in the ladies room of all places where in a classic scene both sets of twins finally encounter each other and realise that there was a mix up at birth and that the two Sadie 's are really the city Sheltons while the two Rose 's are really the twins meant to be in Jupitor Hollow . The fast approaching stock holders meeting really puts the girls to the test when Sadie ( Shelton ) , is locked up in a closet to prevent her from selling off her birthplace and its up to Sadie ( Ratliff ) , to put all her watching of her idol Alexis Carrington in "" Dynasty "" , to good use when in a hilarious moment she has to take over the meeting and turn the vote around from allowing Jupitor Hollow to be strip mined which she does beautifully . Classic comedy if ever there was in my book and it reminds me of the antics of the pair of identical cousins , on the classic 1960 's comedy series "" The Patty Duke Show "" . I do nt think I 've ever seen Bette Midler in finer form than in "" Big Business "" . Her comic timing and facial expressions are first rate and her switch from playing the hard as nails Sadie Shelton who 's all "" hostile takeovers "" to the naive and totally impressionable country bumpkin Sadie Ratliff who only wants to be able to say "" keep the change ! "" is a revelation and will send you into tail spins of laughter . Her classic mirror sequence with her "" twin "" , is a total riot and her statement that "" this whole thing has got UFO written all over it!"",will have you breaking up with laughter . Equally Lily Tomlin as both country activist Rose Ratcliff , "" I 'm gon na go kick some snooty New York Ass ! "" , and as Rose Shelton the awkward out of place city girl "" I hate shopping and I hate New York in June!"",is also top rate . Her rejection of Jay 's engagement ring as a supposed "" bribe "" and when she then refers to the poor puzzled man as a "" great big belly scraping pile of cow plop ! "" , is one of the absolute comic highlights of the whole movie and is a scene I never tire of replaying a dozen times with each screening I have of this movie . Of course with the two sets of twins winding up both staying in adjoining suites at New York 's Plaza Hotel there are many hilarious moments when outsiders get the pairs mixed up . Two of my favourites are the unfortunate desk clerk 's ( Joe Grifasi ) , continual mixing up of Sadie Shelton / Ratliff which results in his receiving a broken jaw instead of the passionate night of love making he imagined , and especially Fabio Alberici 's ( Michele Placido ) , total confusion about just who are the women who he is supposed to be doing business with - one minute they are corporate killers , the next ladies too afraid to pick up a car phone ! The hilarious crossovers of characters walking in one door and coming out as another is beautifully played out in the breakfast room scenes when both women ( one from the country and the other from the city ) , seemingly sit down for two breakfasts each much to the total confusion of each other and also the staff . It is however the unforgettable one liners that are liberally sprinkled throughout the script that create the greatest laughs and congratulations have to go to both Bette Midler and Lily Tomlin for making them seem just as fresh and funny on the tenth screening as on the first . Classics like : "" I m gon na dip him in flour and fry him in his own grease!"",""Oh my God it 's so COSMOpolitan "" , "" Oh sure its full of crowds , smog , sex fiends , and white slavers , it 's a pistol , I 've got about as much use for it ( New York ) , as a Toad has for spit pearls ! "" , "" Computer chips , they 've got their ways ! "" , and "" Have you got your brains and your balls in your briefcase ? "" , are guaranteed to crack you up with laughter as each new misunderstanding presents itself in the convoluted script . Total escapism perhaps but this comedy never fails to get me laughing and coming back for more . It is a real pity that "" Big Business "" , so far has marked the only time that Bette Midler and Lily Tomlin have worked together as the pair combine so well and would be wonderful together again in some other comedy vehicle . This film is a true comic treasure and can be enjoyed by all ages . I 've been introducing it to my friends and family for years and the film now has many people as devoted and fanatical about it as I am ! So I 'd say to you that unless you have your brains and your balls in your briefcase get out there and find yourself a copy of this classic film soon if you have n't already . You wo nt regret it for one minute if only to enjoy these two comic legends , in Bette Midler and Lily Tomlin battling it out in a country values vs city profits laugh feast in "" Big Business "" . Enjoy !",1430,1,0.00010695187165776336,0.06327626546229986,0.00010695187165776336,0.00010695187165776336,0.00010695187165776336,0.01728151021955353,0.005558893582661075,0.043744608474318006,0.00010695187165776336,0.00010695187165776336,0.00010695187165776336,0.01413712030530285,0.08028057560793625,0.00010695187165776336,0.00010695187165776336,0.00010695187165776336,0.00010695187165776336,0.00010695187165776336,0.00010695187165776336,0.011275615394305835,0.48198790136404296,0.00010695187165776336,0.00010695187165776336,0.007344246749369633,0.00010695187165776336,0.00010695187165776336,0.1363485960695095,0.00010695187165776336,0.00010695187165776336,0.00010695187165776336,0.00010695187165776336,0.00010695187165776336,0.050132932460663714,0.00010695187165776336,0.00010695187165776336,0.006666097028046107,0.007547699748162935,0.00010695187165776336,0.00010695187165776336,0.00010695187165776336,0.0319674548371034,0.00010695187165776336,0.00821285993784787,0.018801269480259817,0.00010695187165776336,0.00010695187165776336,0.011906941513910464,0.00010695187165776336,0.00010695187165776336,0.00010695187165776336,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0

57251,4,"A few reasons to pick this up . This is worth buying just to see:1 . The look on Pete Townsend 's face when Billy Idol ( as Cousin Kevin ) puts his arm around Pete 's shoulder.2 . Steve Winwood realizing he does n't actually know the words to the "" listening to you , I get the music ... "" section of the last song.3 . Roger Daltrey fumbling with a microphone that he 'd tossed in the air and unsuccessfully attempted to twirl and catch.4 . Some of the most hilarious haircuts and outfits in the history of rock and roll.5 . The only halfway decent thing Phil Collins ( as Uncle Ernie ) ever did in his entire career . This 3 DVD package also includes Quadrophenia and the second set from the night that Tommy was recorded . This second set is full of hits and it 's definitely worth watching .

57254,4,"Get down and give me 20 ! Although I enjoy Pilates and yoga , I need a good workout that makes me sweat . Boxing and martial arts classes are great for that purpose . But there are times where I prefer to feel the burn at home . To that end , one of the best cardio / strength DVD workouts I 've found is "" Crunch : Boot Camp Training . "" The workout runs for about 30 minutes , which is great for those days where I want a shorter ( but still effective ) one . It 's short because exercises are combined together in order to minimize time and maximize benefit . For example , three - to - ten pound hand weights are used to work the upper body while doing squats and lunges . Abs and obliques are worked on the floor with different types of crunches , and during standing cardio work by side knee lifts . Of course , a boot camp workout would be incomplete without pushups - there are three sets , each with a different emphasis to shake things up ( and the lower body is worked in as well ) . A cooldown / stretch session concludes the proceedings . As for the instructor , Susan Hitzmann is one of the best I 've seen on a DVD workout . She has an infectious enthusiasm that challenges and encourages at the same time . She calls well , using a clear and authoritative voice . I also enjoyed the chemistry between her and the rest of the class . This is one of the few DVD workouts where I can identify with the assistants , because they look like they are actually working out . They moan , groan , and laugh like real people , and plastic smiles are kept to a minimum . Finally , the generic accompanying music complements the workout without overwhelming it . There are two caveats for "" Crunch : Boot Camp Training . "" First , it might be hard on someone with sensitive knees because there are a lot of squats and forward lunges . I had an ACL recon years ago , so I usually do backward lunges in place of the forward ones ( the workout also features backward lunges ) . Also , the routine 's fast pace and combinations may confuse or wear out beginners . But easier variations are demonstrated by a woman on the instructor 's left side , so this is a workout you can grow into . Even so , if your body takes time to get limber due to age or previous injury , you may want to warm up on your own beforehand . "" Crunch : Boot Camp Training "" is an excellent boot camp - style home workout . I own a large number of exercise DVDs , and this one 's on my go - to stack . Highly recommended",504,1,0.20886029943472798,0.00024096385542171514,0.00024096385542171514,0.00024096385542171514,0.00024096385542171514,0.00024096385542171514,0.00024096385542171514,0.00024096385542171514,0.00024096385542171514,0.00024096385542171514,0.00024096385542171514,0.025579598204911715,0.00024096385542171514,0.00024096385542171514,0.00024096385542171514,0.00024096385542171514,0.03460010208631406,0.06161553938744138,0.03637189309760665,0.00024096385542171514,0.00024096385542171514,0.00024096385542171514,0.00024096385542171514,0.00024096385542171514,0.00024096385542171514,0.00024096385542171514,0.00024096385542171514,0.00024096385542171514,0.01099927003080509,0.01955748181457667,0.00024096385542171514,0.00024096385542171514,0.1270237810999434,0.00024096385542171514,0.130544059936566,0.012623291275874133,0.00024096385542171514,0.00024096385542171514,0.03949075080009586,0.05445263428340799,0.1219390895801217,0.00024096385542171514,0.014041538646174932,0.00024096385542171514,0.00024096385542171514,0.09386693538167254,0.00024096385542171514,0.00024096385542171514,0.00024096385542171514,0.00024096385542171514,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
57261,4,"Great 3D for a enjoyably stupid movie OK , there is not really much to say here except that if you like to show off your field sequential 3D set you should have this disc as the depth is great and there is almost no ghosting in the entire film . The Plot is pure ham and cheese . A whacked out scientist steals the original manuscripts for Dracula , Frankenstein , The Werewolf of Paris , and The Mummy and begins to suck out the life force of a young librarian in order to bring the essence of the archetypes contained in the books to life . ( I told you it was stupid)Before the entire experiment can transpose the girl escapes midway through and we are left we pint sized versions of the classic monsters who are none too happy about their current height . If you can accept a movie on the level of a Police Academy or Earnest goes to Camp then you should not have a problem with this .

It 's very clean , sharp , and clear . I do n't remember any issues on the past DVD , but if there were any , it seems like they were cleared up for this release .

Most of his character is known in this set . It seemed almost if Yugi was only a side - note for a while . Even though I dislike dub , this was still good enough for me . The scene when Marik talks to his brother for the last time ( or so he thinks at that moment ) is one of the most beautifully drawn of any anime I 've seen . If only the voice actor sounded like Marik 's age for once and kept the poignant music .

57291,4,"Tears For The Hometown Hero ! Every fiber of my being is incorporated into this review for Jack "" Ti Jean "" Kerouac ! To actually see most of Kerouac 's fellow writer 's and poet 's giving his or her true and poignant interpretation of the unmitigated "" genius "" that was this brother Lowellian is in itself a magnificent production ! I bought this DVD today at a mall in New Hampshire and could have bought it for less on Amazon.com ! Just a few minutes ago I did order the DVD "" Jack Kerouac - King of the Beats "" on Amazon.com and ca n't wait for its arrival ! If it 's anything like "" What Happened To Kerouac ? "" then it will surely be another masterful production ! After I write this review I am going to watch this DVD again and experience the same chills as I did when initially watching it for the first time ! Anyone that is a true fan of Kerouac and his works will be smitten with this production because you are reliving pure literary genius ! To hear the poetry and prose from the lips and soul of Kerouac himself is truly awe - inspiring !

57301,4,"That There Might Be Witness : Through the Eyes of Children It is said that suffering develops character . Surely , when photographer Zana Briski went on a photography pilgrimage to the red light district in Sonagchi , Calcutta , in India , she discovered more character , and in smaller shape and size , then she might have imagined . Peering through a lens into the darkest shadows of life - into the world of prostitution - to capture the images the world wishes not to see , not , at least , from this angle of truth , she saw between the life - battered women ... their children . When we think of brothels , however we might think of them , how many think of children ? Whether we think of these places and their inhabitants as figures of perversity , embodiments of lust , or the tragic painted clowns of the joke that is humanity , it is probably more true than not that these women are rarely seen as , well , women . They are perhaps at best merely meat , merely body parts , to be used and abused and then tossed aside . What Zana Briski 's photo lens reveals is that these are indeed women , human beings , and , for better or for worse , also mothers , daughters , wives , sisters . We see in this montage of photos and film combined , women who are deformed by the ugliness inside . They are broken , they are stunningly and fiercely angry at the world that has so betrayed them , yet they also have their moments of hope and tenderness . All of this , and more , falls upon the heads of their children . Weaving between these women are their little ones , boys and girls who grow up around the perversities of lust and abuse . What might such children be like ? This is the sharp focus of Briski 's lens . Perhaps we need to look at ugliness to see beauty in contrast . The faces and spirits of these children contain both . They have in them the despair of those forgotten and betrayed by the world . Society all around them refuses them a place outside the red light district . They are already banned from normalcy . They have been witness to humans at their worst , and no one outside wishes to bear the weight of such witness . Yet they will not be silenced , and if we do not wish to hear them speak , then Briski has given them cameras to let them capture their worlds , inside and out , and bring these images to us . What these children capture on film is nothing less than breathtaking . They miss nothing . Their intense talent and power of seeing discovered , this film also shows us how Briski works to bring this artistic discovery to the world , meanwhile also fighting to give these children a chance , slim as it is , to a life of normalcy . Key to this is education , yet as she soon learns , no school in Calcutta wishes to enroll children born into brothels . At last and with determined persistence , she does find one , and a portal into life beyond opens for some of the children . Their photos , too , are put on exhibit , available also now in book format . Some are saved , some are pulled back into the dark . The individual stories of these tiny photographers are stories that must be witnessed , heard and seen , so that they know : everyone matters . Even in the darkest shadows , we refuse to be blind to them any longer",647,1,0.0002409638554217134,0.026666640387423696,0.0002409638554217134,0.01982083466692745,0.0002409638554217134,0.0002409638554217134,0.0002409638554217134,0.3181874914392914,0.01374251618938441,0.0002409638554217134,0.0002409638554217134,0.0002409638554217134,0.11137327276753964,0.0002409638554217134,0.0002409638554217134,0.0002409638554217134,0.0002409638554217134,0.0002409638554217134,0.0002409638554217134,0.0002409638554217134,0.0002409638554217134,0.0002409638554217134,0.0002409638554217134,0.0002409638554217134,0.0002409638554217134,0.014104124839549,0.0002409638554217134,0.0002409638554217134,0.0002409638554217134,0.0002409638554217134,0.0002409638554217134,0.0002409638554217134,0.0002409638554217134,0.0002409638554217134,0.22164493517312242,0.0002409638554217134,0.016509777518143552,0.0002409638554217134,0.0002409638554217134,0.014057584232270458,0.10681067044252836,0.012289159592298215,0.0002409638554217134,0.11563636624549635,0.0002409638554217134,0.0002409638554217134,0.0002409638554217134,0.0002409638554217134,0.0002409638554217134,0.0002409638554217134,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

57315,4,"Cliffhanger Certainly one of the great classics of alltime and proof positive that they do n't make movies like this anymore ! From the instant when the dazzling 3-D artdeco credits appear , we 're onboard for the ride of our lives , actually the lives of hero Cary Grant ( 1904 - 86 ) and Eva Marie Saint . The plot of this 100 percent attention - keeper thickens as its characters sicken . Notable in the glorious cast are the handsomely ignoble James Mason ( remember him ? 1909 - 84 ) and ever - dapper Leo G. Carroll ( who later played the ghost in the TV series Topper ) . Superbly angled cinema shots feature lush hotel interiors - the elegant UN - an aerial shot of ant - tiny Cary Grant in existential torment against desolate grasslands - and closeups of Mount Rushmore , which Hitchcock had dreamt of shooting , here becoming a backdrop of life - and - death drama . Of the 50-some films of Sir Hitchcock ( 1899 - 1980 ) I 'd rate this in the top three , with Psycho and Rebecca rounding out the bases .",198,1,0.0008695652173913689,0.0008695652173913689,0.0008695652173913689,0.0008695652173913689,0.036727109515664665,0.0008695652173913689,0.0008695652173913689,0.2105260967909804,0.0008695652173913689,0.0008695652173913689,0.0008695652173913689,0.0008695652173913689,0.0008695652173913689,0.0008695652173913689,0.0008695652173913689,0.0008695652173913689,0.0008695652173913689,0.0008695652173913689,0.0008695652173913689,0.0008695652173913689,0.0008695652173913689,0.0008695652173913689,0.0008695652173913689,0.09025264492980231,0.0008695652173913689,0.0008695652173913689,0.05989458483193033,0.0008695652173913689,0.0008695652173913689,0.07477157893553411,0.0008695652173913689,0.0008695652173913689,0.0008695652173913689,0.0008695652173913689,0.0008695652173913689,0.0008695652173913689,0.0008695652173913689,0.0008695652173913689,0.0008695652173913689,0.0008695652173913689,0.0008695652173913689,0.0008695652173913689,0.0008695652173913689,0.48956711543086817,0.0008695652173913689,0.0008695652173913689,0.0008695652173913689,0.0008695652173913689,0.0008695652173913689,0.0008695652173913689,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1

57330,4,"Scathing Hollywood satire This is a wonderful inside - Hollywood thriller / comedy directed by Robert Altman . Tim Robbins stars as a big shot producer who begins receiving hate mail from one of his rejected writers . He thinks he 's figured out who it is ( Vincent D'Onofrio ) , goes to meet him , and in a rage kills him . He then falls in love with D'Onofrio 's weird girlfriend ( Gretta Scacchi ) , an artist who ca n't ever finish anything . There is also a movie within the movie which has to do with the making of a melodrama in which an innocent woman is about to be executed - only to be rescued at the last minute by the D.A. Altman 's theme has to do with the Hollywood version of reality , which is nothing more than what will earn big bucks ; it has nothing to do with "" truth . "" A long list of Hollywood stars make cameo appearances . It 's really a well - done movie , very classy and hip . Altman also satirizes Hollywood power players extremely well - it 's a whole other world out there in LaLa land",206,1,0.0006666666666667268,0.0006666666666667268,0.0006666666666667268,0.0006666666666667268,0.0006666666666667268,0.0006666666666667268,0.0006666666666667268,0.0006666666666667268,0.0394681642598143,0.0006666666666667268,0.0006666666666667268,0.03399095654118593,0.0006666666666667268,0.0006666666666667268,0.0006666666666667268,0.0006666666666667268,0.0006666666666667268,0.0006666666666667268,0.0006666666666667268,0.0006666666666667268,0.5409750132799516,0.0006666666666667268,0.0006666666666667268,0.0006666666666667268,0.0006666666666667268,0.0006666666666667268,0.0006666666666667268,0.0006666666666667268,0.0006666666666667268,0.0006666666666667268,0.0006666666666667268,0.0006666666666667268,0.0006666666666667268,0.0006666666666667268,0.0006666666666667268,0.0006666666666667268,0.0006666666666667268,0.0006666666666667268,0.0006666666666667268,0.0006666666666667268,0.0006666666666667268,0.03400000000000098,0.0006666666666667268,0.3215658659190447,0.0006666666666667268,0.0006666666666667268,0.0006666666666667268,0.0006666666666667268,0.0006666666666667268,0.0006666666666667268,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
57331,4,"Absolutely "" Stellar "" I 've actually been hoping for a live CD release , but I was more than happy with this DVD . All the favorites are here ( only a minor gripe with the omission of Echo and 11 am , and the inclusion of Priceless , but that 's just personal preference ) . This is all the evidence needed to show that this band has reached maturity . Drive is an unexpected change , but being the most played - out song in their lineup , the obscurity is welcome . The musical talent all around seems much improved from the previous DVDs , and each member gets to show off all their new tricks . Unlike some other bands , Incubus seems to perfectly display each musician 's talents so well with each song , and this -for me- showed how it can all be put together so seamlessly . Every song is a highlight on this one - my favorites are Made for TV Movie and Sick Sad Little World . Other notes : It 's the perfect place to film for a DVD ; We get to see Brandon play guitar and how well Ben works as a backup singer ; and I think Jose could make any rock band sound good .

57334,4,"EPIC : Amazingly real and terrifically told ... Das Boot is an epic film that is very well done . I loved the suspense and terrific character moments . The thrills are well paced and we get a feeling of the boredom and terror of living in a Nazi U - boat in the midst of the Atlantic during 1941 WWII . Going 60 days with no sight of the enemy helps show the epic nature of the ocean . The three week storm is well crafted and adds so much more tension to the film . This movie is now one of the top ten movies of all time for me . In viewing the DVD , I chose to turn on English Subtitles while also selecting the English 2.0 spoken language . What is interesting is how the english dub has paraphrased certain lines and in others totally changed every meaning behind the statements . I 'm talking about the line that , in German , reads something like "" I ca n't wait to get back home and f**k the h*ll out of a few wild wh**es ! "" is rewritten and dubbed as "" When I get home I 'm going to shower and sleep until December ! "" Quite a drastic change . But of course , sailors in the German Navy use language that I suppose is unacceptable - even in an "" R "" rated movie - for English audiences ... There are more than fifteen conversations of that nature that have been translated into English subtitles from the German language spoken in the original dub of the film , while the English dub is totally different . Later in the film , there are even lines shown in subtitles that are not spoken at all in the English dub . Very interesting and fun to watch . Even with the subtitles on , I enjoyed this movie from start to finish . I love the epic movies that run well over two and a half hours . This one clocks in at a good four and a half hours ! It draws you in and keeps you going from the very first moment to the very last explosion ... One of the best war movies I have ever seen!One of the most interesting ironies of this film is that the entire movie takes place within the Nazi U - boat and we get to see and feel compassion for the German men who fight to keep the boat afloat . The irony occurs when the Allied forces attack them and we get to experience the other side of the equation . Very intense and dramatic",453,1,0.0002597402597402828,0.0002597402597402828,0.0002597402597402828,0.04672510715481113,0.0002597402597402828,0.011861666924487934,0.0002597402597402828,0.02656148988854543,0.0002597402597402828,0.0002597402597402828,0.0002597402597402828,0.0002597402597402828,0.0002597402597402828,0.0002597402597402828,0.026213886817635767,0.0002597402597402828,0.0002597402597402828,0.0002597402597402828,0.0002597402597402828,0.0002597402597402828,0.3082737014009639,0.0002597402597402828,0.0002597402597402828,0.0002597402597402828,0.0002597402597402828,0.0002597402597402828,0.08245823498306769,0.0002597402597402828,0.0002597402597402828,0.0002597402597402828,0.0002597402597402828,0.017329075317501014,0.0002597402597402828,0.0002597402597402828,0.08902185656556535,0.0002597402597402828,0.0002597402597402828,0.13448835268494266,0.0002597402597402828,0.0002597402597402828,0.0002597402597402828,0.0002597402597402828,0.0002597402597402828,0.15167328136579505,0.08053852763178872,0.0002597402597402828,0.014984689394764666,0.0002597402597402828,0.0002597402597402828,0.0002597402597402828,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0
57335,4,"Better than any other baby video These are the best dvds out there for babies because they are full of live action animals , people , flowers , water , etc . I got them for my daughter when she was about 3 months old - she loved them then and she still loves them at 6 months .

57348,4,"Still my favorite anime after all this time This anime was what got me hooked on anime years ago when it first came out on cartoon network , and now is definetly considered a classic alongside Cowboy Bebop and others . This is truly a wonderful series that reaches somewhere inside you and pulls you into the very souls of the characters and you feel like you know these people . Yoko Kanno is my favorite music director and the music is absolutely perfect . It 's so beautiful and fits the story so well . The overtone is semi dark with those special times where the mood is happy and cheerful . As for the languages and region , while I would n't know yet for this particular box set , I would assume it is just like the individual DVDs they put out with Japanese and English language and English subtitles . And I do n't know where to look for the region of the DVD , but I think it might be region 1 , whatever it means . I do know that I have n't had any troubles playing it on any of our DVD players .

57350,4,"Moving and influential I first saw this movie in high school in the theater . I was extremely moved by the film , and it triggered a facination with South Asia that lasts to this day - I even work half the year in Sri Lanka now . So for me , personally , this movie is of tremendous influence . I understand the arguements about the crediting of non - white actors ; I always wondered why Candice Bergman is given top billing , given that she only appears in a very few scenes . Well , that 's the way of the world - it 's marketing right or wrong , and to get people into the theater you highlight those who are well known . It 's not right , but that 's Hollywood . I mean , better to have unfair credits than to not have the movie at all , yes?And you 've got to admit , it was quite a debut for Ben Kingsly . Wow . He 'll be forever known for this role . That aside , this is an excellent , amazing film . Of course , it 's still highly relevant , perhaps even more so in our post-911 world of fear . The movie ends with a feeling of real hope and inspiration . A must - see for anyone who feels anger , fear , agressively nationalistic , hopelessness , hatred , or lost .

57363,4,"Something is rotten in the state of Tokyo ... "" The Bad Sleep Well "" is a forgotten gem from one of Japan 's great masters , Akira Kurosawa . His other two Shakespeare adaptations , "" Throne of Blood "" ( Macbeth ) and "" Ran "" ( King Lear ) , are much more famous and well - regarded , justifiably so if you have seen them ( "" Ran "" is particular is my favorite of all Kurosawa films ) . However , this sharp and caustic adaptation of Hamlet deserves an equal amount of praise and recognition . It may be the most bleak subject matter that Kurosawa ever tackled - the corruption in the highest levels of government in post - war Japan . The film begins with a long but funny wedding sequence that illustrates Kurosawa 's great skill as a director . We ( and the camera ) are among a group of reporters discussing the numerous convenient reasons for the marriage ; the bride is lame and the daughter of Iwabuchi , the head of corporation , and the bridegroom , Nishi , has aspirations to elevate his status in the business . We see the comedy of manners play out in this sequence in increasingly humorous situations as the various parties deny these rumours and reporters comment to each other , culminating in the panicked looks on the faces of the corporate higher - ups as the wedding cake arrives - in the shape of their office building , Public Corp. , with a red X marking a spot in one of the windows where one of their former partners commited suicide . It 's a virtuoso sequence that perfectly sets up the tone of the rest of the film . The newspapers have a field day with this , especially when various members of Public Corp. are investigated for fraud and embezzlement , yet they stoically remain silent and the case goes nowhere . Then it heats up again as a few of them commit suicide ; the rumours are that they were goaded into doing so ( n fact , they were ) . However , without any substance to press the matter , the case is dropped . And that 's when the real story begins - one of the Public Corp executives , Wada , survives and is rescued by Nishi and his shadowy accomplice , Itakura . This is followed by a brilliant scene in which Wada is taken to his own funeral and observes the farce - all the while , Nishi plays him a tape with Moriyama and Shirai , his former partners , plotting his murder . The way Kurosawa stages this is masterful ; the sublime music emanating from the funeral is contrast dramatically with the cold - blooded words of Public Corp , as Wada listens on . One of the ways Wada contributes is to scare the living hell out of Shirai - Wada poses as a ghost of himself in order to freak out Shirai ( a pointed but clever method of tying in the ghost in Hamlet ) . As the plot progresses , Nishi reveals his reasons for saving Wada and exacting a very personal revenge on Iwabuchi and his cohorts ; the story 's pace becomes more frantic and exciting . Technically , Kurosawa is at his best here . The wedding and the funeral are both marvels and they contrast each other perfectly . He uses a lot of intriguing mise - en - scene compostions for his interiors that serve to highlight his characters ' inner thoughts but very little movement of the camera in order to manipulate his audience ; the dark nature of the story is enough to suck you in . One of the fascinating observations in "" The Bad Sleep Well "" is that all of the characters are morally bankrupt and filled with secrets - even Nishi , the protagonist . His wife , the Ophelia character , is the only one that Kurosawa allows us to feel sympathy for , and even then in the end she is not fully spared her grief . Taken in this context , Kurosawa 's Hamlet becomes a study in the morality and pragmatism of revenge but also an incisive jab at the fat cats in modern Japan . If there is a flaw in the film , it is that the overall pacing is not always brisk enough to sustain the long running time ( 2 1/2 hours ) . The wedding , despite being absolutely essential , is protracted ; the rest of the film is much quicker but still drags in parts . Also , Kurosawa seems unsure about his ending ; the film ends quite abruptly but appropriately in terms of his larger point about the hopelesness of fighting the rampant corruption , I would argue . However , despite these flaws , overall "" The Bad Sleep Well "" is a masterful and dark excursion into the seedy side of corporate crime , using Shakespeare Hamlet brilliantly but not completely as it 's core . Toshiro Mifune in particular gives one of his most unique low - key performances ; instead of his usual fiery exterior we get a performance full of internalized anger throughout .

57374,4,"Without a doubt , the definitive version of Blade Runner . While I 've always loved Blade Runner , the so - called "" Theatrical Cut "" was seriously marred by narration that was hilariously blunt in content and awful in its monotone articulation . Harrison Ford has claimed he did this on purpose with the hope that the whole narration would be scrapped . But Hollywood , in its infinite vulgarity and congenital contempt for its audience 's intelligence and artistic sensitivity , stuck with it anyway , on the assumption that we needed to be spoon - fed with sophomoric incompetence . Equally stupid , though less damaging in that its effect was more restricted , was the inappropriate sappy ending , which not only contradicted the entire thematic essence of the film but its visual essence as well . It did n't even make any sense : the earth was supposed to be ravaged by wars . But Hollywood , with characteristic cowardice , trembled in fear at the thought of actually challenging an audience . Rick Deckard 's fate at the end of the Director 's Cut is far more memorable than the nonsense inflicted on theater viewers in 1982 , and the subsequent VHS audience . It reminds me of what Orion Pictures did to George Romero 's Monkeyshines . ( Since when does a Romero film end with two people grinning at each other like lovesick idiots ? ) Or how about the "" happy ending "" grotesquely grafted onto Terry Gilliam 's Brazil?The extra footage between Deckard and Rachael , while not extensive , enriches the characterizations , however modestly , and the brief dream sequence pays off by the end . The only thing I regret is that the extra bloody footage - in the eye gouging and hand impaling scenes - found on the old VHS tape was not included in the Director 's Cut . Which means that this is not fully the Director 's Cut : the material was left out to garner the sacred , almighty "" R "" rating upon the film 's re - release , as it was the first time around . One would think it would have been restored on DVD , but Warner , with their predictable spinelessness and artistic ineptitude , decided against it . They probably rationalized it by saying to themselves that Ridley Scott would have wanted it that way . Can anyone say "" Eyes Wide Shut""?The fact that there are viewers course enough to value the "" theatrical cut "" and loathe the improved and definitive edit of the film may only go to show that Hollywood may not be underestimating their intelligence and artistic sensitivity after all . And "" definitive "" the Director 's Cut is : despite the one hesitation over the missing bloody footage , there is no doubt that this is the only version of the film that should ever be viewed again , by anyone .",505,1,0.08213562945702382,0.0002857142857143182,0.0002857142857143182,0.0002857142857143182,0.0002857142857143182,0.017370329985638124,0.0002857142857143182,0.0002857142857143182,0.0647755713061918,0.0002857142857143182,0.0002857142857143182,0.0002857142857143182,0.20123318695040107,0.0002857142857143182,0.0002857142857143182,0.0002857142857143182,0.018100875349772703,0.0002857142857143182,0.0002857142857143182,0.0002857142857143182,0.0002857142857143182,0.0002857142857143182,0.0002857142857143182,0.0002857142857143182,0.019654300441184543,0.0002857142857143182,0.0002857142857143182,0.0002857142857143182,0.0002857142857143182,0.0002857142857143182,0.0002857142857143182,0.0002857142857143182,0.06299259571325364,0.0002857142857143182,0.0002857142857143182,0.0002857142857143182,0.0002857142857143182,0.0002857142857143182,0.0002857142857143182,0.0002857142857143182,0.0002857142857143182,0.0002857142857143182,0.0002857142857143182,0.5217375107965332,0.0002857142857143182,0.0002857142857143182,0.0002857142857143182,0.0002857142857143182,0.0002857142857143182,0.0002857142857143182,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

57389,4,"Dazzlements I 'm another of those who saw this at Sundance , and all the things I enjoy about Gaiman and McKean 's graphic novels were on display : the quiet humor , the intelligence , the delightful weirdness , the astounding visual vocabulary . Except that in this case , the words are spoken by good actors , and all those visuals get up off their feet and move . It 's hard to describe the impact of watching a McKean painting move and talk . There might be those who quibble about the movie looking too "" animated , "" but of course that 's exactly the point : to create a world and make it dance . The end result , visually at least , is like nothing you 've ever seen before , and absolutely worth seeing for that reason alone . Some of the people I talked to after the screening also loved the visuals but felt the story was a bit dull , that they had seen it all before . Well , it 's true that the story does wear its influences on its sleeve -- a little "" Alice in Wonderland "" here , a little "" Time Bandits "" there , a lot of "" Wizard of Oz "" over here , not to mention a resemblance to Gaiman 's own "" Coraline . "" But I 'm just as familiar with those stories as anyone else , and the resemblances never interrupted my enjoyment of "" MirrorrMask""--after all , it 's what you do with a story that determines its success . And from moment to moment , there was enough innovation and cleverness , enough delight and wonder , to make the movie a positive delight . When the movie came out in theaters I went to see it again , and there was a little girl about six years old in the row ahead of me who sat through the whole thing with eyes agog ; then a friend of mine tried to show the DVD to her young son but he got completely creeped out by the spider - thingie . ( Hey , in "" Wizard of Oz "" the moment when the Witch appears in the crystal ball had exactly the same effect on me -- yet it lingered in memory , and when I got older I was drawn back and fell in love with the movie . That 's how this stuff works . ) "" MirrorMask "" was probably a little too wild to be a full - out commercial success ; but I bet it 's going to have a long , long shelf life on DVD as people pull it out to tell their friends "" Wait till you see this .",472,1,0.08883444655598927,0.00026666666666668706,0.00026666666666668706,0.00026666666666668706,0.00026666666666668706,0.015256396175829063,0.00026666666666668706,0.00026666666666668706,0.00026666666666668706,0.00026666666666668706,0.00026666666666668706,0.00026666666666668706,0.09667443045805127,0.00026666666666668706,0.00026666666666668706,0.00026666666666668706,0.00026666666666668706,0.04778438215511651,0.00026666666666668706,0.00026666666666668706,0.39339464965763643,0.00026666666666668706,0.00026666666666668706,0.00026666666666668706,0.00026666666666668706,0.00026666666666668706,0.00026666666666668706,0.00026666666666668706,0.00026666666666668706,0.015141002814623019,0.00026666666666668706,0.00026666666666668706,0.00026666666666668706,0.00026666666666668706,0.17011407027936434,0.00026666666666668706,0.00026666666666668706,0.00026666666666668706,0.00026666666666668706,0.00026666666666668706,0.056446187159220805,0.013758367247057738,0.00026666666666668706,0.00026666666666668706,0.06065113126402481,0.03154493623308607,0.00026666666666668706,0.00026666666666668706,0.00026666666666668706,0.00026666666666668706,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0

It is a beautiful heartwarming movie , with gorgeous scenery , unforgettable characters , and plenty of moments to laugh and cry",109,1,0.0010526315789474475,0.0010526315789474475,0.0010526315789474475,0.0010526315789474475,0.0010526315789474475,0.0010526315789474475,0.0010526315789474475,0.0010526315789474475,0.0010526315789474475,0.0010526315789474475,0.0010526315789474475,0.05253560175136187,0.0010526315789474475,0.0010526315789474475,0.0010526315789474475,0.0010526315789474475,0.0010526315789474475,0.0010526315789474475,0.0010526315789474475,0.0010526315789474475,0.6525579934412534,0.0010526315789474475,0.0010526315789474475,0.16626532216533285,0.0010526315789474475,0.0010526315789474475,0.0010526315789474475,0.0010526315789474475,0.0010526315789474475,0.0010526315789474475,0.0010526315789474475,0.0010526315789474475,0.0010526315789474475,0.0010526315789474475,0.08022003001046946,0.0010526315789474475,0.0010526315789474475,0.0010526315789474475,0.0010526315789474475,0.0010526315789474475,0.0010526315789474475,0.0010526315789474475,0.0010526315789474475,0.0010526315789474475,0.0010526315789474475,0.0010526315789474475,0.0010526315789474475,0.0010526315789474475,0.0010526315789474475,0.0010526315789474475,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1
57421,4,The story of a film genius I saw this on PBS ' Great Performances . This documentary is about film genius Akira Kurosawa . The documentary charts Akira Kurosawa 's early life in pre - WWII Japan to the end of his life . Kurosawa brought Japanese cinema to a world wide audience . I recommend this DVD for anyone who is a Akira Kurosawa fan . Plus the DVD has 100 minutes of bonus interview footage not seen on the PBS program and Kurosawa filmography,86,1,0.0010000000000000523,0.0010000000000000523,0.0010000000000000523,0.0010000000000000523,0.0010000000000000523,0.0010000000000000523,0.0010000000000000523,0.07332035853425267,0.0010000000000000523,0.0010000000000000523,0.0010000000000000523,0.04651868227272965,0.0010000000000000523,0.0010000000000000523,0.0010000000000000523,0.0010000000000000523,0.0010000000000000523,0.16720202469676557,0.05099006044834826,0.0010000000000000523,0.0010000000000000523,0.0010000000000000523,0.0010000000000000523,0.054577720597820796,0.0010000000000000523,0.0010000000000000523,0.0010000000000000523,0.0010000000000000523,0.0010000000000000523,0.0010000000000000523,0.0010000000000000523,0.0010000000000000523,0.0010000000000000523,0.0010000000000000523,0.0010000000000000523,0.0010000000000000523,0.0010000000000000523,0.0010000000000000523,0.0010000000000000523,0.0010000000000000523,0.0010000000000000523,0.0010000000000000523,0.0010000000000000523,0.5633911534500806,0.0010000000000000523,0.0010000000000000523,0.0010000000000000523,0.0010000000000000523,0.0010000000000000523,0.0010000000000000523,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1

57445,4,"A Blossoming Career Deserves A Better Production Than This Li is no heavy - weight pianist . Neither is Bunin or even Zimerman . And do n't foeget that Chopin himself weighed less than a hundred pounds after all . And judging from the steam and progess Li has made , Lang Lang 's position is certainly under threat . And any viewer who is interested in Li or how Chinese pianists nowadays are doing should perhaps go for this-- here we have to thank Martha for doing a good job in picking him as the winner of the Chopin Competition . Now in his mid - twenties , and musically out of almost nowhere , Li is already a full fledged musician . Of course , viewers should not compare him with Arrau 's fine balance between the extreme high and rather low register ; or his scales with Richter 's . This is not fair , for Arrau and Richter are such great artists . Li is already so close to Zimerman now . Furthermore , what we hear may have more to do with the accoustics of the hall , something which has more to do with the engineers than the performer himself . And I say so because I 'm a bit concerned about the quality of the picture of this DVD . It appears to me more like a VCD than DVD production ( or somewhere in between ) : it is slightly below average DG production and the camerawork is also average only . This is obviously not fair to a blossoming career that Li is now having . One star is taken for want of a better production .",286,1,0.0006451612903226461,0.20101675003627217,0.05496137464807931,0.0006451612903226461,0.02739478774722278,0.0006451612903226461,0.0006451612903226461,0.0006451612903226461,0.1302282190518204,0.0006451612903226461,0.0006451612903226461,0.0006451612903226461,0.0006451612903226461,0.0006451612903226461,0.0006451612903226461,0.0006451612903226461,0.18632881048102087,0.07514452963173744,0.0006451612903226461,0.0006451612903226461,0.0006451612903226461,0.0006451612903226461,0.0006451612903226461,0.0006451612903226461,0.0006451612903226461,0.0006451612903226461,0.0006451612903226461,0.0006451612903226461,0.0006451612903226461,0.03589336337947932,0.0006451612903226461,0.0006451612903226461,0.2222057857931902,0.0006451612903226461,0.0006451612903226461,0.0006451612903226461,0.0006451612903226461,0.0006451612903226461,0.040374766327949174,0.0006451612903226461,0.0006451612903226461,0.0006451612903226461,0.0006451612903226461,0.0006451612903226461,0.0006451612903226461,0.0006451612903226461,0.0006451612903226461,0.0006451612903226461,0.0006451612903226461,0.0006451612903226461,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I borrowed this movie from a friend and looking at it , it appears to be one of those movies with no plot and just a lot of nudity . Well , this movie does have a plot and it 's quite complicated . Some of the dialouge falls short in a few scenes , but you ca n't argue that this is a damned good movie . Matt Dillon stars as Sam Lombardo , a guidance counselor at Blue Bay High School . Lombardo is a lady 's man , in one scene a prosecutor mentions that he 's done half of Blue Bay . Well , Lombardo has a student named Kelly Van Ryan ( Denise Richards , who i 've never found particularly attractive but looks great in this movie ) who seems to be coming onto him ; Lombardo happens to be having an affair with her mother Sandra who happens to be a very powerful woman in Blue Bay . Well , one day Kelly and a friend stop by on a weekend and wash Lombardo 's car for the senior car wash and then we see Kelly leaving his house with a mad look on her face . Then , Kelly says Lombardo raped her . Lombardo immediately declares his innocense and hires a lawyer ( Bill Murray ) . Well , then another girl named Suzie Toller ( Neve Campbell ) says Lombardo raped her as well . Another player in the plot is Ray Duquette ( Kevin Bacon ) , the detective investigating the rapes who is skeptical of both stories . Now , this movie is one of those films where you think you know what 's going on and then they throw a wild card . After that , you think you know what 's going on again and then s*it happens . Even when the movie ends , you do n't know the full story until the credit sequence . The sex scenes ( the most famous with Denise Richards , Matt Dillon , and Neve Campebell ) are quite nice , but surprisingly the movie would be good without them . This is a really great movie and worth the $ 5 bucks it would cost to buy it .",444,1,0.00023529411764708637,0.00023529411764708637,0.00023529411764708637,0.00023529411764708637,0.04892122434384502,0.00023529411764708637,0.00023529411764708637,0.00023529411764708637,0.00023529411764708637,0.00023529411764708637,0.00023529411764708637,0.00023529411764708637,0.00023529411764708637,0.00023529411764708637,0.014095800947849374,0.00023529411764708637,0.00023529411764708637,0.0151235476018091,0.011999999999999558,0.04340850718759674,0.5567476008188436,0.13418229982483507,0.00023529411764708637,0.00023529411764708637,0.00023529411764708637,0.03202122106253391,0.00023529411764708637,0.00023529411764708637,0.00023529411764708637,0.00023529411764708637,0.00023529411764708637,0.00023529411764708637,0.00023529411764708637,0.00023529411764708637,0.00023529411764708637,0.00023529411764708637,0.00023529411764708637,0.00023529411764708637,0.00023529411764708637,0.017220183408779077,0.00023529411764708637,0.012008830189822866,0.013029574039568477,0.00023529411764708637,0.06996286084177758,0.00023529411764708637,0.022572467379797546,0.00023529411764708637,0.00023529411764708637,0.00023529411764708637,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0
57465,4,PLEASE STOP THE CRYING ALREADY : - ( ......... I really wish that people would stop trashing this movie for being unbeleivable and that it is so long it hurts to sit through it etc . I have watched the film 4 times and have not had a problem with the length . The movie is about a giant gorilla ! It is a fantasy film kids ! The original is one of my favorite movies and there is plenty to laugh at in that one as well . I think the remake is incredible ..... is it better than the original ? In some ways yes ! in some ways no ! That s the way it goes ! I still love the new one and the original and both deserve to be in everyone 's movie collection ! I wish Peter Jackson would try to remake Son of Kong into as good a movie ..... now if he can pull that off ....... ;- ),167,1,0.0005882352941176935,0.0005882352941176935,0.0005882352941176935,0.0005882352941176935,0.0005882352941176935,0.030104327929560533,0.0005882352941176935,0.0005882352941176935,0.0005882352941176935,0.0005882352941176935,0.0005882352941176935,0.02932100824321601,0.0005882352941176935,0.0005882352941176935,0.0005882352941176935,0.0005882352941176935,0.0005882352941176935,0.0005882352941176935,0.0005882352941176935,0.0005882352941176935,0.7061023728659431,0.0005882352941176935,0.0005882352941176935,0.0005882352941176935,0.0005882352941176935,0.0005882352941176935,0.0005882352941176935,0.0005882352941176935,0.0005882352941176935,0.0005882352941176935,0.0005882352941176935,0.0005882352941176935,0.0005882352941176935,0.0005882352941176935,0.0005882352941176935,0.03062810260986564,0.0005882352941176935,0.0005882352941176935,0.05795124343076272,0.0005882352941176935,0.0005882352941176935,0.029999999999999295,0.0005882352941176935,0.09059882727359175,0.0005882352941176935,0.0005882352941176935,0.0005882352941176935,0.0005882352941176935,0.0005882352941176935,0.0005882352941176935,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

57524,4,"Reiner 's Masterpiece . For the old days ....... Setting and Theme(s ) : Castlerock , smallville , summer friends ' adventure , life 's lessons , solidarity found in kinsmanship and standing tall against the unknown . This 1986 instant classic of Rob Reiner 's directing earns its spot on the mantle of other inimitable works of film . The musical score is dramatic , it sets the tempo from start to finish , and it never misses a beat ; each song and rhythm takes you somewhere within the movie 's unfolding , and you do n't forget where until it all coalesces in a fabulous concluding . The lives of four local pals are traced from the impatient , lazy summer days of grandeur , to the oft treacherous events inherent in a trip initiated on spontaneity . One can in Stand By Me favorably assume to watch : pie eating contests , leeches , trains , train dodging , mail ball , fancy cars , fancy footwork ( i.e. Verno 's beloved comb 's freefall ) , cantenes ( thought they disappeared w/ Ben Franklin 's outlets ) , junkyard dog chases , and much much more . The ending is the real gravy . The narration is superb also . By far one of the favorite films of my youth . Believe John Cusack can be seen playing the role of Gordy 's football star elder brother ? Stand By Me is the childhood that big city life just does n't afford , at least not anymore . Everyone nowadays instead chooses to remain trapped in their offices and maniacal distresses ; rustic destination spots , like the ones presented in this movie , are still out there folks . With a smidgen of ambition toward adventure , which will take your there , the healing power of the wilderness can become appreciated . Although movies and books alone can never fully capture the true splendor of the outdoors . Five stars for Reiners finest photoplay .",342,1,0.00048780487804882673,0.00048780487804882673,0.0510811664875963,0.00048780487804882673,0.00048780487804882673,0.00048780487804882673,0.00048780487804882673,0.1306358495514502,0.00048780487804882673,0.00048780487804882673,0.00048780487804882673,0.00048780487804882673,0.00048780487804882673,0.00048780487804882673,0.00048780487804882673,0.00048780487804882673,0.00048780487804882673,0.00048780487804882673,0.00048780487804882673,0.00048780487804882673,0.32364918485441935,0.00048780487804882673,0.00048780487804882673,0.03932513824952053,0.00048780487804882673,0.00048780487804882673,0.0664759506980207,0.00048780487804882673,0.00048780487804882673,0.06381296068005433,0.00048780487804882673,0.00048780487804882673,0.037030669712163115,0.00048780487804882673,0.00048780487804882673,0.00048780487804882673,0.04356727936134307,0.00048780487804882673,0.00048780487804882673,0.00048780487804882673,0.00048780487804882673,0.03954711806053384,0.00048780487804882673,0.18536248722294546,0.00048780487804882673,0.00048780487804882673,0.00048780487804882673,0.00048780487804882673,0.00048780487804882673,0.00048780487804882673,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

57527,4,"A tepid ghost story Half Light is a movie my wife would like , if I can convince her that it 's not too scary for her . She is the most timid of movie goers , and refuses to watch horror movies with me . But Half Light is a ghost story very much in the classic sense : there are some scares , but at the most tepid edge of today 's horror . The movie is much more about the grief of a mother ( have the Kleenex box close by ) , and has a big love story ( with running horses on a romantic beach with a lighthouse ; ugh ) in the middle of it . Just the kind of thing my wife might like , when she 's willing to see something on her scary side . Unfortunately for me , this is not my kind of movie at all . Even so , it was well made . It was well acted . The English locations were impressively beautiful . The story was interesting , and had a good plot twist at the end .

57531,4,"CSI Miami reaches a high point with Season 3 : Sun , Glamour , and Overacting Galore ! CSI : Miami , having evolved with difficulty over the first two seasons , reaches its high point in Season 3 . Anyone who has watched the show realizes that Horatio , unlike Gil Grissom or Mac Taylor , is the true star of the show . The rest of the CSIs are entertaining , but the show is truly about him . This dynamic , when combined with the glamour and glitz of the Miami setting and crimes most foul , make this for me the CSI that is above the rest . Plotwise , season 3 is bit over the top . Issues covered in this season include a stalker murder , a sports star on trial for his wife 's murder , a young woman killed in a club , the murder of a uniformed cop , gang warfare in a hospital , the killings of IRS agents , speed dating that ends in a death , spree killing , and the murder of a wingwoman . Some of the lesser episodes involve our old friend Clavo Cruz , a giant boa contricter that eats a woman , skaters and gamers , and of course , the infamous tsunami episode . The season incorporates the Raymond Caine subplot heavily in the last 5 or 6 episodes . This leads up to a satisfying conclusion in the season finale . The season is also one of change . A regular cast member gets killed in episode 1 , which quite frankly , was quite a relief since the character was terrible . Another regular , not a CSI , kills himself . A new cast member joins , Officer Ryan Wolfe , makes the transfer from patrol to CSI , and making some waves in the process . Callie and Delco ( who has very little to do this season ) have a tough time dealing with tragedy , and we actually see Horatio dating a rather attractive Assistant DA , at least for a few episodes . Some old familiars pop by , including Suzy and Madison , and Raymond Caine 's killer Bob , who ends up being much more important in the story than we assumed . All in all it adds up to a great season , which will be extremely difficult to top in Season 4.People either love or hate this show , so if you count yourself among the fans , this is a must addition to the collection .

The supporting roles are superbly done , the tension in the plot is sustained well until the end , and when this shows up on cable TV I almost always watch it again for a half - hour or so . Here you find soldiers and the law and political correctness in conflict , and that reflects a lot of real life in the USA during the past four years . I enjoy the script , because it demonstrates how brain power sometimes wins out over brute force .",123,1,0.0009090909090909821,0.0009090909090909821,0.0009090909090909821,0.0009090909090909821,0.0009090909090909821,0.0009090909090909821,0.0009090909090909821,0.0009090909090909821,0.0009090909090909821,0.0009090909090909821,0.0009090909090909821,0.0009090909090909821,0.0009090909090909821,0.0009090909090909821,0.04636229397277603,0.0009090909090909821,0.0009090909090909821,0.05017228029329868,0.0009090909090909821,0.0009090909090909821,0.0009090909090909821,0.2931229702200216,0.0009090909090909821,0.10549508266634046,0.0009090909090909821,0.0009090909090909821,0.0009090909090909821,0.0009090909090909821,0.0009090909090909821,0.04369925104480391,0.0009090909090909821,0.0009090909090909821,0.0009090909090909821,0.0009090909090909821,0.0009090909090909821,0.0009090909090909821,0.0009090909090909821,0.0009090909090909821,0.0009090909090909821,0.0009090909090909821,0.07969255213453032,0.04649319514650718,0.0009090909090909821,0.29678055633990064,0.0009090909090909821,0.0009090909090909821,0.0009090909090909821,0.0009090909090909821,0.0009090909090909821,0.0009090909090909821,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1
57566,4,"Surprisingly Entertaining Could n't believe that this was the same John Lithgow who starred in "" Third Rock From the Sun "" , an hilarious comedy that ran for a few years on NBC . John plays the ultimate bad guy seeking twisted revenge for being stopped in his tracks by Denzel 's character . Wasn't expecting much , but this movie was surprisingly entertaining . Yes , it was a little violent , and some parts were a tad unbelievable , but overall , Denzel and John were worthy antagonists . Boy , Denzel sure was gorgeous ! ! Still is .",103,1,0.0010000000000000792,0.0010000000000000792,0.0010000000000000792,0.0010000000000000792,0.0010000000000000792,0.0010000000000000792,0.0010000000000000792,0.14102075142711584,0.0010000000000000792,0.0010000000000000792,0.0010000000000000792,0.0010000000000000792,0.0010000000000000792,0.0010000000000000792,0.0010000000000000792,0.0010000000000000792,0.0010000000000000792,0.0010000000000000792,0.0010000000000000792,0.0010000000000000792,0.5392429996271956,0.17367882618168096,0.0010000000000000792,0.0010000000000000792,0.0010000000000000792,0.0010000000000000792,0.0010000000000000792,0.0010000000000000792,0.0010000000000000792,0.0010000000000000792,0.0010000000000000792,0.0010000000000000792,0.0010000000000000792,0.0010000000000000792,0.0010000000000000792,0.0010000000000000792,0.0010000000000000792,0.0010000000000000792,0.0010000000000000792,0.0010000000000000792,0.10005742276400423,0.0010000000000000792,0.0010000000000000792,0.0010000000000000792,0.0010000000000000792,0.0010000000000000792,0.0010000000000000792,0.0010000000000000792,0.0010000000000000792,0.0010000000000000792,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1
57569,4,"Cold War in the High Arctic This is a good cold war drama . After a Soviet spy satellite comes down in the wrong place , the race is on to recapture the film . As was pointed out in the film , the Soviets used their German scientists to launch the satellite containing the camera stolen from England 's German scientists using a special film developed by the US 's German scientists . The film has the location of both side 's missile installations and both sides want it . Neither side will give an inch . The chase takes place with a US nuclear sub , overcrowded by marines and spies . The problem is that there is a double agent on board who will give up his own life to sabotage the mission . The twists and turns do n't stop and neither does the excitement . The film is dated but still a good show . The photography especially is spectacular , especially for that day and age . Rock Hudson leads an all star cast which does a great job across the board .",189,1,0.0005714285714286144,0.0005714285714286144,0.0005714285714286144,0.0005714285714286144,0.019954080993249985,0.0005714285714286144,0.029143973376571132,0.0005714285714286144,0.0005714285714286144,0.0005714285714286144,0.0005714285714286144,0.02906787429685823,0.0005714285714286144,0.0005714285714286144,0.0005714285714286144,0.0005714285714286144,0.1701056523332381,0.0005714285714286144,0.0005714285714286144,0.0005714285714286144,0.0005714285714286144,0.0005714285714286144,0.044620015451392436,0.0005714285714286144,0.0005714285714286144,0.04584710865995369,0.0005714285714286144,0.0005714285714286144,0.0005714285714286144,0.0005714285714286144,0.0005714285714286144,0.08194149796076979,0.0005714285714286144,0.0005714285714286144,0.0005714285714286144,0.0005714285714286144,0.0005714285714286144,0.0005714285714286144,0.0005714285714286144,0.0005714285714286144,0.0005714285714286144,0.0005714285714286144,0.0005714285714286144,0.4568991119456848,0.035762386484571106,0.0005714285714286144,0.0638011556405659,0.0005714285714286144,0.0005714285714286144,0.0005714285714286144,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0
57570,4,"One of my all time favorites I had to replace my video with this DVD version . This movie is spectacular -- beautiful photography , excellent acting , and most importantly a tremendous comment on the social restrictions placed on women of the time . It is based on the true life of one of the first commissioned female artists in Europe . Artemesia , whose father is an artist , is forbidden to draw or paint the human body . Her efforts to do so lead her into difficulties . Her father is supportive but even he must fight the social structure -- especially when trying to get her into the male - only art school . He finally gets her apprenticed to another talented artist and is devastated when he finds they have engaged in an "" unlawful "" relationship . He files rape charges and everyone suffers .

57583,4,"Moore 's best film , before he became a political celebrity ... I really liked this film . Before Michael Moore became a liberal celebrity , he was a completely obscure magazine writer and filmmaker . This film was a major underground hit at the time , and it still is excellent today . You really feel for the people who lose their jobs , and you 're infuriated by the callous indifference of Roger Smith and the management of General Motors . I really liked the segment where Flint tries to reinvent itself as tourist mecca of the Midwest . It consisted of a horribly misguided attempt at opening up a Hilton in downtown Flint , and opening up a theme park called Auto World . It justs smacks of desperation and stupidity ; it has make you laugh and grimace at the same time . Instead of giving these people really good jobs again , they come up with this idiotic scheme , which ended up in disaster ( both the Hilton and Auto World closed within a year ) . Moore in recent years has become a "" political celebrity "" , in that politics has become quite the cottage industry in America . It 's not just Moore doing it ; right wingers like Hannity and Coulter have been doing it too . They all got books ; some of them got films ; some of them have radio shows . A lot of them are n't really interested in changing anything , as it might interfere with their livelihoods . I do n't know if Moore is like that or not . But this is still a potent , darkly funny film about real class warfare , and the dismantling of the working class in America .",302,1,0.0003921568627451291,0.0003921568627451291,0.0003921568627451291,0.0003921568627451291,0.0003921568627451291,0.0003921568627451291,0.0003921568627451291,0.16700102482209547,0.0003921568627451291,0.0003921568627451291,0.0003921568627451291,0.0003921568627451291,0.24383554154731216,0.0003921568627451291,0.0003921568627451291,0.0003921568627451291,0.0003921568627451291,0.0003921568627451291,0.0003921568627451291,0.0003921568627451291,0.0003921568627451291,0.1923089526342855,0.0003921568627451291,0.0003921568627451291,0.0003921568627451291,0.0003921568627451291,0.0003921568627451291,0.0003921568627451291,0.0003921568627451291,0.05806725270439186,0.0003921568627451291,0.0003921568627451291,0.0003921568627451291,0.0003921568627451291,0.0003921568627451291,0.0003921568627451291,0.02897248585048151,0.0003921568627451291,0.025023057366532087,0.0003921568627451291,0.025657404636644923,0.0003921568627451291,0.0003921568627451291,0.24266369220296116,0.0003921568627451291,0.0003921568627451291,0.0003921568627451291,0.0003921568627451291,0.0003921568627451291,0.0003921568627451291,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
57588,4,"Agonized Poetry Visualized Exquisitely Frida is luscious eye candy from beginning to end ; so beautiful it could be enjoyed without sound . This is due to its subject , its star , and its director , Julie Taymor , who also gave us the astounding Titus . ( If you have not yet seen Titus , do so before finishing this review - it is an art director 's tour de force on a par with Brazil.)Regardless of where one falls on the political spectrum , one ca n't help but be intrigued by the fascinating , and certainly unconventional , people of Frida . Diego Rivera , played superbly by Alfred Molina , boasted the traditional faults of great artists , ( narcissism , thoughtless cruelty , obsessive egotism ) , while showcasing some exceptional ones , ( art as propaganda device , naive political idealism ) . His flaws were as large as his murals , but he was never dull . In addition to starring as Frida , Salma Hayek co - produced the film and pretty much moved heaven and earth to get it made . How wonderful that she did . Hayek has traveled under a Hollywood curse , appearing in one dreadful picture after another . This is clearly the film she wants to be remembered by , and her performance is note perfect . The story is so full of pain and passion that it could easily become maudlin and goopy , but Hayek never lets that happen . Her Frida is heart and steel all at once - amazing . The take home message , if there is one , is that great art is never free . In the case of Rivera , others paid the price ; he fed off others like a greedy child . In the case of Frida Kahlo , she herself paid the price , digging further and further into her own pain and laying it bare in a way that is almost unspeakably brave . There are moments of magic realism in Frida , where we move imperceptibly from the filmed image to paintings and vice versa - if nothing else this reveals the paintings for what they were , astounding autobiographical statements . There are a few missteps . The liaisons with Trotsky and Josephine Baker feel almost obligatory , as if a form is being filled out . But blemishes this small are overshadowed by so many splendid moments , for example , when Rivera 's dog urinates on his painting and he responds by calling him the best art critic in Mexico . Beyond highly recommended - must viewing .",449,1,0.0003448275862069385,0.0003448275862069385,0.0003448275862069385,0.0003448275862069385,0.13722349275595355,0.0003448275862069385,0.017936968923667407,0.0003448275862069385,0.0003448275862069385,0.0003448275862069385,0.0003448275862069385,0.06741442788359521,0.0003448275862069385,0.0003448275862069385,0.0003448275862069385,0.0003448275862069385,0.0003448275862069385,0.0003448275862069385,0.0003448275862069385,0.0003448275862069385,0.0003448275862069385,0.0003448275862069385,0.0003448275862069385,0.0003448275862069385,0.0359062205408892,0.0003448275862069385,0.059686916565138574,0.0003448275862069385,0.017739813578899567,0.0003448275862069385,0.0003448275862069385,0.0003448275862069385,0.0003448275862069385,0.0003448275862069385,0.0003448275862069385,0.0003448275862069385,0.0003448275862069385,0.0003448275862069385,0.03213632342353336,0.0003448275862069385,0.0003448275862069385,0.021640695257924586,0.0003448275862069385,0.44989884851324013,0.02178914718382664,0.12517886951126111,0.0003448275862069385,0.0003448275862069385,0.0003448275862069385,0.0003448275862069385,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0

I thought "" Silence Of The Lambs "" was good - it featured a great performance by Anthony Hopkins , and the rest of it was .... good . But that was about it , as far as I was concerned . It just did n't really click with me , and it was n't anything near the great movie I 'd been hoping for , so when its sequel was released I did n't feel any great need to rush out and get it as soon as it was released . A bit surprisingly though , I thought "" Hannibal "" was really great once I finally did see it . Everyone said it was more geared toward horror than "" Silence ... "" ( which is fine by me ) and it may have been , marginally . But much more than that , it was just a Better horror movie than its predecessor , and it was also a better thriller and a better drama movie , in my opinion . Hopkins is just as good , if not better , than he was as Dr. Hannibal Lecter the first time around , and while I usually do n't like recasting roles in a movie ( unless the actor or actress is playing a creature or monster or something where you do n't see their real face or hear their real voice , and even there they sometimes end up getting the mannerisms wrong ) Julianne Moore did a great job stepping into the Clarice Starling role originally played by Jodie Foster . The movie centers around the hunt to find Lecter by the only victim of his original , pre - incarceration , carnage to survive - a thoroughly despicable pedophile who avoided ever being charged for his crimes by cutting a deal with prosecutors to give evidence against Lecter . It seems like "" Hannibal "" has changed tract from "" Silence "" and is implying that most if not all of Lecter 's victims May have been horrendous individuals who in some way brought his wrath down upon themselves . Whether that 's the truth or whether it was just this one victim who was so reprehensible , the effect was to create a foil for Hannibal who 's even more evil than he is . Hannibal Lecter himself is , well , he 's not a ' good guy ' in this movie ; he is , though , presented in very cryptic shades of grey . His behaviors contradict one another but do so in a way that feels real , and he 's much more interesting as a character this time around . Clarice also is ; she comes across here as a character who 's somehow traumatized , perhaps even mentally unbalanced , deep down but supresses it so well that it took a genius like Lecter to ever see it , and that 's what so intrigued him in the first place . One possible interpretation of things overall ( and this is just one of many potential takes on it ; the movie briefly and subtly hints at so many different things that you could take away just about anything from it - making it a great source of conversation for movie - lovers ) is that Hannibal Lecter is a person who had / has the potential for great goodness within himself but chose evil , while Clarice Starling has the potential for great darkness and Hannibal - level violence in her , but chose to be good , chose in fact to make her career in opposing those who give in to the same darkness . A lot of food for thought in this one ( no pun intended ) . Great performances all around ; in notable addition to Hopkins and Moore the brilliant Gary Oldman plays Lecter 's nemesis and the chronically overlooked and under - rated Ray Liotta plays an unlikable , rather creepy FBI agent who 's constantly at odds with Starling . A very , very engaging and wel - made movie",713,1,0.14724758710999977,0.00018181818181819568,0.00018181818181819568,0.00018181818181819568,0.11638170288129991,0.02576319517141459,0.00018181818181819568,0.00018181818181819568,0.00018181818181819568,0.00018181818181819568,0.00018181818181819568,0.00018181818181819568,0.00018181818181819568,0.00018181818181819568,0.00018181818181819568,0.00018181818181819568,0.087639986135135,0.00018181818181819568,0.00018181818181819568,0.00018181818181819568,0.547988965638449,0.00018181818181819568,0.00018181818181819568,0.00018181818181819568,0.00018181818181819568,0.00018181818181819568,0.00018181818181819568,0.00018181818181819568,0.00018181818181819568,0.00018181818181819568,0.00018181818181819568,0.00018181818181819568,0.04707555682499648,0.00018181818181819568,0.00018181818181819568,0.00018181818181819568,0.00018181818181819568,0.00018181818181819568,0.02008482442052314,0.00018181818181819568,0.00018181818181819568,0.00018181818181819568,0.00018181818181819568,0.00018181818181819568,0.00018181818181819568,0.00018181818181819568,0.00018181818181819568,0.00018181818181819568,0.00018181818181819568,0.00018181818181819568,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Put your hands together for Naaaacho Liiiibbbbre!Jack Black ( KING KONG ) returns as another obsessive character in Jared Hess ' latest cinematic offering , NACHO LIBRE . Most will remember Hess for his stunning direction of NAPOLEON DYNAMITE . Here he gets a bit more money for production and gives us a hilarious tale of a Mexican monk who 's early dreams of becoming a luchador ( wrestler ) come to fruition later in life . Jack Black plays Nacho , a cook at an orphanage / monastery where his talents as a chef come into question daily . But the one thing Nacho yearns for is to become a professional wrestler . His contact sports passions are reignited by the arrival of a beautiful nun named Sister Encarnacion ( Ana de la Reguera ( LADIES NIGHT ) , and by a wily thief named Esqueleto ( SUPERVIVENCIA ) , a streetwise thug with bizarre moves . Esqueleto and Nacho team up and eventual take to the ring , only to be beaten time and again , but still making money . But making money is n't enough for Nacho ( "" I want to win ! "" ) . Vanity gets the better of Nacho and he tries everything to achieve his goal of becoming a winner , including finding a shaman who gives him sketchy advice regarding eagle eggs . Finally Nacho learns that winning comes from within and uses his "" inner "" strength to make his way to the top . Silliness occasionally racks Nacho Libre , but it is saved by Jack Black 's incredible physical comedy . Not since SCHOOL OF ROCK has he been so well cast . The training scenes alone are worth the price of the rental ( Cow dung to the face ? A wasps nest to the head ? Shooting Esqueleto with a blunted arrow ? ) When Nacho tries to court Sister Encarnacion , the comedy is further ratcheted up as Jack Black uses his butt - muscle tone in a nut cracking fashion ! Napoleon Dynamite fans will flock to Hess ' latest film , and will probably be amazed at what he accomplished with a little more cash and a few Hollywood well - known actors",419,1,0.0003773584905660768,0.0003773584905660768,0.0003773584905660768,0.0003773584905660768,0.0003773584905660768,0.0003773584905660768,0.0003773584905660768,0.25599693185173883,0.0003773584905660768,0.0003773584905660768,0.0003773584905660768,0.0003773584905660768,0.0003773584905660768,0.0003773584905660768,0.0003773584905660768,0.0003773584905660768,0.0003773584905660768,0.0003773584905660768,0.0003773584905660768,0.0003773584905660768,0.24155850532564374,0.0003773584905660768,0.0003773584905660768,0.0003773584905660768,0.0003773584905660768,0.0003773584905660768,0.02558746280737074,0.0003773584905660768,0.0003773584905660768,0.0003773584905660768,0.0003773584905660768,0.0003773584905660768,0.0003773584905660768,0.0003773584905660768,0.0003773584905660768,0.09670135153493402,0.0003773584905660768,0.0003773584905660768,0.0003773584905660768,0.14068460006694716,0.042806266355452184,0.0003773584905660768,0.0003773584905660768,0.18043846696357213,0.0003773584905660768,0.0003773584905660768,0.0003773584905660768,0.0003773584905660768,0.0003773584905660768,0.0003773584905660768,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

This movie is a rather complex movie and not the typical "" first gay love movie "" , but if you like movies that are not , this one if a must have . The movie is not a hardcore sex movie , in fact there is only one scene of sex , in the movie . The positives of this movie are , it uses silence as a tool and it looks into a differnt kind of first love , one that does n't turn out in the same way other movies portray .

57619,4,"All teen movies should be this great I love this movie . While the teen movie stereotypes are always apparent in every film , "" She 's All That "" does n't go overboard and , surprisingly , presents a relatively realistic view of the high school social strata . After Zach , the class president and soccer star , is very publically dumped by his "" magically delicious "" ( and equally popular ) girlfriend , Taylor , he 's hard put to maintain his legacy . Uber - jock , though a little slow , Zach 's friend , Dean , bets him that he ca n't replace Taylor and make any girl prom queen . Enter Laney Boggs , an art student who cares little about the social scene . Dean picks Laney as Zach 's prom queen "" project "" and Zach has a hard time convincing Laney to even go out with him . Meanwhile , Taylor , the ex , is dating a Real World reject who she met over spring break , but she 's still catty over her "" discards "" and is horrible to Laney , embarassing her at a party . The more time Zach spends with Laney , the more he starts to like her and Laney begins to open up and finds a real outlet in her art . Dean , sensing he might be about to lose the bet , asks Laney to prom before Zach gets around to it and , a recently single Taylor , attaches herself to Zach 's arm , assuming he 'll take her back . Ultimately , feelings are hurt , battle lines are drawn ... and a really cool dance scence takes place at the prom . I love the fresh comedy in the movie that is amusing for teens without being impractical or raunchy . The characters are well - developed and actually evolve in a realistic fashion ( even if you are left wondering how nice - guy Zach ever dated self - absorbed Taylor Vaughn).All - in - all , there 's really nothing comparable to the teen movies like "" Sixteen Candles "" or "" Pretty In Pink "" because those are genres unto themselves , but "" She 's All That "" is definitely a nice representation of a good , modern teen movie",399,1,0.0003389830508474859,0.10759814298871588,0.0003389830508474859,0.0003389830508474859,0.0003389830508474859,0.0003389830508474859,0.018675543480234383,0.07513878952368917,0.0003389830508474859,0.0003389830508474859,0.0003389830508474859,0.0003389830508474859,0.0003389830508474859,0.0003389830508474859,0.0003389830508474859,0.0003389830508474859,0.0003389830508474859,0.0003389830508474859,0.0003389830508474859,0.0003389830508474859,0.4677093610905919,0.12754834751385338,0.0003389830508474859,0.0003389830508474859,0.0003389830508474859,0.09567987988920829,0.0003389830508474859,0.0003389830508474859,0.0003389830508474859,0.01783717859720996,0.0003389830508474859,0.0003389830508474859,0.0003389830508474859,0.0003389830508474859,0.0003389830508474859,0.0003389830508474859,0.0003389830508474859,0.0003389830508474859,0.0003389830508474859,0.0003389830508474859,0.0003389830508474859,0.0003389830508474859,0.0003389830508474859,0.07557546878090264,0.0003389830508474859,0.0003389830508474859,0.0003389830508474859,0.0003389830508474859,0.0003389830508474859,0.0003389830508474859,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

57622,4,"A Story Worth The Whole Nine Yards If there is one war story to keep on your shelf besides "" Saving Private Ryan , "" this is it . The story starts with a lawyer visiting England as a tourist years after war 's end . He discovers a cheap , ceramic antique which the store owner tells him is of little value . "" Value ? "" replies the lawyer . "" Wrap it very carefully "" he adds . So begins his mental journey back in time to the English airstrip where he served as adjutant of the 918th ( nine , eighteenth ) Bomb Group . This "" hard luck "" group is taken over by a brigadier general from a colonel who has "" over - identified "" with his men , thus putting them before his missions . The general , Frank Savage , must restore group discipline and performance before the group disintegrates as an effective fighting unit . General Savage puts mission before men and turns the disgruntled men who despise him into a cohesive unit . They turn into a group that will do anything to keep from being left behind , or letting down their new leader . ( Each announcement of a mission for the following day is characterized by the operations officer going to the mantel piece in the Officers ' Club , and turning the head of a ceramic pirate , face outward.)But the tough general will not make the same mistake that the last group commander makes . He will always keep the mission first , and will not over - identify with his men . He will not let the loss of his men affect him . Or , will he?This black and white story is exceptional and superbly acted . It shows the mental tug - of - war a leader must make in the decisions that will cost the lives of men he has come to admire and respect . It depicts how the ugliness of war brings out the best in ourselves , and creates fraternal bonds that last a lifetime . This is not a gory story , but it is one that will leave you breathless . It may sadden you , but it will not disappoint you . It does not end with everyone living , or happy . War never does . P.S.

57654,4,"Not For Everyone Witch Hunter Robin is a great series which I enjoyed immensely but fails at delivering some of its finer qualities throughout the course of the series . The visuals are first rate , the music ( when there is music ) is beautiful , and the storyline is intriguing . Silence and extended stares cloak the characters in mystery ... so what 's the problem ? That same cloak covers the series in what could potentially be a series of yawns . One of the major problems with Witch Hunter Robin is the pace . Many serious animes either take themselves too seriously or not seriously enough ... WHR takes itself much too seriously . Surely the story and visuals are worth it but for some reason there are long , tiring sequences during the course of the series which are supposed to be "" meaningful . "" They are I suppose in retrospect ( one will notice this once they watch the final episodes of WHR ) , but the events in the series do not warrant such extended periods of self reflection on the part of the main character(s ) . The psychological and philosophical themes present are obvious toward the end of the series , and where they are not , the intelligent viewer can pretty much guess at them . I realize that this exhausted review of WHR seems to only be about the tiresome pace at which the series progresses , but it 's an important factor as it leaves many to simply drop the series half way before ever seeing the later episodes ( the best episodes in my opinion).A second problem is also the fact that there are a number of "" witch capturing "" which take place during the series that seem ... well , silly . The beginning of the series is all about these capturing - surely after seeing the last couple of episodes the viewer begins to understand how this ties into rounding out the characters but during the course of the series this might just bore you to tears especially if a number of episodes feature witch / enemies that simply do n't interest you ( which they may not , the creativity and design behind many of them is poor to say the least).In the end the series is about the characters , story , and visuals not the enemies which frequently populated much of the series - if you find yourself hooked on the main characters and their back - stories when they are introduced in the beginning of the series then you might like the whole thing . Lastly as for reviewers that were expecting something "" scary , "" most of the shows on Adult Swim are for adults and the anime shows featured on Adult Swim are geared toward those typically interested in other things beside quick thrills ( needless to say those watching the series probably are n't into it because the name of the series is "" Witch Hunter , "" they are instead - hopefully - looking for a high quality , cohesive action / drama anime ) . This is not for individuals wanting to watch an action anime however ... it 's more of a beautiful drama . Younger anime viewers are not bound to like this one at all!!!I'd give it a try first renting it before you go out and spend money on it !",582,1,0.2230283059977039,0.00020833333333335468,0.047027823766582495,0.00020833333333335468,0.00020833333333335468,0.00020833333333335468,0.00020833333333335468,0.00020833333333335468,0.028804809009068358,0.00020833333333335468,0.00020833333333335468,0.00020833333333335468,0.00020833333333335468,0.00020833333333335468,0.012621145164635509,0.00020833333333335468,0.00020833333333335468,0.00020833333333335468,0.00020833333333335468,0.00020833333333335468,0.00020833333333335468,0.10582260828340397,0.00020833333333335468,0.2481482454531582,0.00020833333333335468,0.00020833333333335468,0.015146418700557388,0.00020833333333335468,0.021158382935634688,0.00020833333333335468,0.00020833333333335468,0.00020833333333335468,0.00020833333333335468,0.00020833333333335468,0.21806564395573597,0.00020833333333335468,0.00020833333333335468,0.00020833333333335468,0.00020833333333335468,0.02716659391165962,0.00020833333333335468,0.00020833333333335468,0.00020833333333335468,0.00020833333333335468,0.044885022821859126,0.00020833333333335468,0.00020833333333335468,0.00020833333333335468,0.00020833333333335468,0.00020833333333335468,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0
57658,4,Unbelievable Acting and Cinematography - downright depressing though This movie is going to bring you down . That 's a fact . But it 's hard to deny this movie all the praise it deserves .

57660,4,"Great film , not so great dvd The Movie : One of the boldest and most interesting films of the early 90 's , and one that deserved far more acclaim and attention than it ultimately recieved , this is a smartly written and beautifully acted film that should be seen by any cinemaphile with an open mind . And despite the whining from some , usually hardline Christian , corners , it 's not anti - christian at all . What it is is simply great , imaginative and clever film making , and a superbly done character piece centered around a magnificent performance from Mimi Rogers , ably supported by the likes of David Duchovny , Will Patton and Patrick Bauchau . I 'm not going to go into it too deeply simply because it 's one of those films that should be seen and experienced with as little up front knowledge as possible . ( Please note that I 'm not attacking Christians or Christianity above , just a small , but , as usual , vocal closed minded minority that always gets up in arms about any film that dares tackle any such subject with any degree of honesty instead of going down the traditional biblical fawning path . People who will instantly hate a film like this just "" on principle "" and then proclaim to all that they should avoid "" such trash "" . You know exactly the kind of people I 'm talking about . They 're a minority , they just happen to be a very vocal and closed minded one . And none of that has anything to do with their christianity as much as it has to do with their absolute closed mindedness and their fear of anything that dares stray from a certain comfortable path.)The DVD : The good news , this film is finally on dvd , and with a pretty decent audio commetary to boot . The bad news , the movie has been badly misframed , which is something that becomes obvious in a couple of key scenes especially . I 'm not sure whether this was done as a form of censorship ( as the misframing of one scene does effectively nullify a sequence of any real nudity that it once had ) or whether it was just a botched transfer , but it is clearly misframed regardless as I saw this film twice on it 's theatrical run and the framing is different now than it was then . Plus the misframing is quite obvious anyway , and on the audio commentary you can even hear remarks about the film pertaining to parts of the print that are no longer visible due to said misframing ( so clearly they were watching the film in it 's proper framing ) . Unfortunately this does n't appear to be available anywhere else on dvd , so if you want the film on dvd right now this is your only option , just be aware going in , and hope for a better release somewhere down the track . Apart from the framing issue the sound and audio quality are perfectly fine , and the only other notable extra is the film 's trailer . The bottom line : A really good , bold , interesting film on a disappointing and variable quality dvd .

57669,4,"Season 3 - -Steele as good as ever ! SEASON 1 : Wonderfully funny with a lot of quick wit , incredible acting for a TV series , and classic plots . All around a great opening season for a classic show . SEASON 2 : Great story lines , very different plots , thickening of the chemistry between Remington and Laura with lots of cliff - hanger moments . The addition of Mildred Krebs in Season 2 was the best move that the show producers made . SEASON 3 : TOPS the first two seasons . It 's hard to hold back and not watch all the episodes in one sitting . The most disappointing thing about season 3 is that you know there are only one and a half season left of this great , classic show . Laura ( Stephanie ) and Remington ( Pierce ) are really just starting to get into the groove of their ever - messy , non - relationship , relationship , and Mildred ( Doris ) is just starting to blossom as an actual "" Gumshoe "" . It is really too bad that this show ended after only 5 seasons . The good news in all of this is that you can watch the shows over and over and not get tired of them . I would highly recommend purchasing Seasons 1 - 3 ( because I 've seen them already ) , as well as the final set of discs ( Seasons 4 and 5 ) , even though I have not yet watched them ( I 'm trying to drag it out and make the show last longer!).One MAJOR down - side ( not with the show itself but with the DVD discs ) is that we have experienced some technical errors with the discs -- stopping completly , skipping to the end or back to the beginning , skipping chapters , etc . One disc will not even play in our computer , which was disappointing because we only figured that out once we were in Africa for 4 months and trying to watch the show one night to relax . It 's too bad that they do n't take more care transfering great shows like this to quality DVD 's for years of non - skipping enjoyment . The same disc did n't have as much trouble playing in our actual DVD player once we were back in the States , but still skipped from time to time .

57671,4,much better than its remake . it was GREAT i loved this movie . for those who gave it one star i guess did nt see how well it was done . In the american version all it was .. was Sarah Michelle Gellar 's face . The Japanese version was much better ( considering it was original and made more sense).it has alot of characters in it but not so much that u will get lost in all of them since they usually die or just do nt appear until later in the film . It has some twists which are good . The american leaves out soo sooo much . In the american one it was basically a dead girl killing random people . In the Japanese one it is touching because the whole time the ghost was reaching out for help . anyway i recommend this to anyone who loves Asian horror and likes a good plot and movie ! ! go see it ! ! and enjoy,171,1,0.0005263157894737287,0.0005263157894737287,0.0005263157894737287,0.0005263157894737287,0.0005263157894737287,0.08237449069930122,0.0005263157894737287,0.0005263157894737287,0.06127951659555948,0.0005263157894737287,0.0005263157894737287,0.0208506630887583,0.0005263157894737287,0.0005263157894737287,0.0005263157894737287,0.0005263157894737287,0.0005263157894737287,0.0005263157894737287,0.0005263157894737287,0.0005263157894737287,0.5742409402678724,0.09250151074656791,0.0005263157894737287,0.0005263157894737287,0.0005263157894737287,0.0005263157894737287,0.06199203365961644,0.0005263157894737287,0.0005263157894737287,0.0005263157894737287,0.0005263157894737287,0.0841292659949539,0.0005263157894737287,0.0005263157894737287,0.0005263157894737287,0.0005263157894737287,0.0005263157894737287,0.0005263157894737287,0.0005263157894737287,0.0005263157894737287,0.0005263157894737287,0.0005263157894737287,0.0005263157894737287,0.0005263157894737287,0.0005263157894737287,0.0005263157894737287,0.0005263157894737287,0.0005263157894737287,0.0005263157894737287,0.0005263157894737287,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
57673,4,"An interesting docudrama Civil War reenactors will enjoy . In all fairness , this film is advertized on the package as a "" docudrama "" and not as a drama . The problem is that it is n't clear from that description whether what is being documented dramatically is the actual 1863 battle or the reenactment of battle on its 140th anniversary . As a documentary about the reenactment , this is a fine collection of footage , interspersed with some ( thankfully ) brief portrayals of the principle leaders on both sides . ( Actually , I thought the actor portraying Longstreet did a fine job -- the others were less convincing . ) As a documentary about the actual historic battle it is not inaccurate but it provides only a glimpse into the major actions that comprised this long and complex battle . As a reenactor , I found it interesting watching the various units on the field . Despite the occassional glimpse of earplugs and sunglasses , the equipment and uniforms appear reasonably authentic . Of course , given the generous build of most of the reenactors in this film the title should have been "" Three Days of Density "" instead . I kid my fellow reenactors ... unfortunately most people who have the money to spend on reenacting also have too much money to spend on good food and drink , myself included . So , if you want to really learn about the battle , read Harry W. Pfanz 's trilogy or Stephen Sears ' book . If you want to see what Civil War reenacting on a grand scale can be like , this is a fine introduction",285,1,0.10836187932392134,0.0004878048780488258,0.05640439133821722,0.0004878048780488258,0.0004878048780488258,0.0004878048780488258,0.0004878048780488258,0.0004878048780488258,0.0004878048780488258,0.0004878048780488258,0.0004878048780488258,0.0004878048780488258,0.0004878048780488258,0.0004878048780488258,0.0004878048780488258,0.0004878048780488258,0.0004878048780488258,0.0004878048780488258,0.0004878048780488258,0.0004878048780488258,0.0004878048780488258,0.0004878048780488258,0.0004878048780488258,0.0004878048780488258,0.0004878048780488258,0.0004878048780488258,0.0004878048780488258,0.0004878048780488258,0.0004878048780488258,0.0004878048780488258,0.0004878048780488258,0.04926829268293019,0.0004878048780488258,0.0004878048780488258,0.0004878048780488258,0.02502242356973327,0.1592909258247734,0.0004878048780488258,0.20392728873811794,0.0769616621595284,0.0004878048780488258,0.0004878048780488258,0.0004878048780488258,0.3002753314847274,0.0004878048780488258,0.0004878048780488258,0.0004878048780488258,0.0004878048780488258,0.0004878048780488258,0.0004878048780488258,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

57687,4,"chocolate delight Maybe better than the original . I liked that they focused on Wonka 's childhood throughout the film . That was something that really added to the storyline . They really did a good job in the beginning making the golden wrapper seem like a big deal , too . I guess the only surprising thing was that the bubble room from the original was n't anywhere to be seen in this one , but in a way the room with the squirrels made up for it . Oh , and the children seemed ESPECIALLY bratty this time , which made it better when those bad things happened to them . A friend pointed out to me that this version has a LOT more musical numbers . Good call . I do n't know if the ending was better than the original , but it was certainly a very good , interesting way to wrap up this wonderful remake . I do n't want to reveal what happens at the end , so let 's just say that when the factory tour is over , and Charlie leaves , there 's still a decent chunk of storyline left . I was kind of disappointed that the whole fantasy of "" living in a world of chocolate "" element was n't really there , which is definitely a bad thing . I mean , come on . We ALL want a world of chocolate ! I just feel there should have been more chocolate - related things included in the film . Overall , it 's probably not better than the original , but it 's not worse either .

57688,4,"Like a magical unicorn rainbow Having seen Stella 's live show in Hollywood , I had a sneaking suspicion that I was going to love their Comedy Central show , and I was not disappointed . These guys have mastered the art of genius - disguised - as - idiocy , and nearly every episode is hilarious from beginning to end . I guess I 'm not surprised it did n't last ; this kind of humor is n't for everyone . But come on ... we are talking about a network whose supposed hits include Mind of Mencia and Blue Collar Comedy , both of which are among the worst dregs that the comedy world has to offer . These guys have been making great comedy for a lot of years , and I hope to see them in another show or movie soon .

57698,4,"Two excellent films for one low price Spider - Man ( 2002 . ) The first Spider - Man film . Spider - Man 2 ( 2004 . ) The second Spider - Man film . INTRODUCTION : In 2002 , the first of the live - action Spider - Man hit theatres . It 's not likely that the film 's director , Sam Raimi , had any idea just how successful his big - screen incarnation of the classic superhero would be . It drew in huge amounts of money at the theatres , and the DVD releases did the same . The sequel , appropriately enough , was even more hyped , and did even better . And now , both films have been combined into a single set ! Read on for my review of the Spider - Man films . STORYLINE : Essentially , this set includes both of the films . The first of the two films explains how Peter Parker got bitten by a radioactive spider , and gained the powers that ultimately turned him into Spider - Man . In the first film , the villain is former head of Oscorp , Norman Osborn , who has been transformed into the Green Goblin by a chemical he was testing . The second film continues two years after the first left off , and features Spider - Man facing off against Doc Ock , a brilliant scientist who has gone mad due to a mixture of not getting the proper credit for his work and an electric shock that permanently grafted mechanical arms to his body . This time around , juggling the duties of being Spider - Man with work and school have made Peter Parker question whether or not he wants to continue the superhero lifestyle . OPINIONS : Both of these films flat - out rule . Seeing the first film turned me into a Spider - Man fan practically overnight . The acting and storyline are both excellent , particuarly Willem Dafoe 's portrayal of Norman Osborn / The Green Goblin . Everything the first film did well , the second one does even better . I was amazed that they managed to create a sequel superior to the original film , since sequels rarely top the film that comes before them - but Sam Raimi does it here . These are great films , and the fact that they 're together in one package only sweetens the deal . DVD : These are the standard DVD releases of the film , meaning each one has a bonus disc of material . There are a ton of bonus features , including commentary , cast and crew interviews , and assorted other extras too . The second disc included with the first film even has a listing of a ton of the old comic books , and the plotlines of them ! That 's my favorite extra on either of the discs . The other features are also excellent , and if you like the films , you 'll agree they 're worthwhile . OVERALL : I ca n't begin to express my satisfaction with these films . The cast and crew have creates two cinematic masterpiece , and I think you 'll agree superhero movies do n't get any better . Being able to get both movies in a single set makes the deal all the more sweet . These are must - watch movies , regardless of who you are . Even if you 're not a big fan of the Spider - Man franchise , you may be pleasantly surprised",613,1,0.00017094017094018617,0.00017094017094018617,0.00017094017094018617,0.00017094017094018617,0.030598082861671018,0.00017094017094018617,0.00017094017094018617,0.18198757317876274,0.00017094017094018617,0.00017094017094018617,0.012518683206446885,0.00017094017094018617,0.00017094017094018617,0.00017094017094018617,0.00017094017094018617,0.00017094017094018617,0.00017094017094018617,0.02518241827523313,0.00017094017094018617,0.00017094017094018617,0.05124010284681373,0.00017094017094018617,0.00017094017094018617,0.06561461125630139,0.00017094017094018617,0.04742665496192587,0.08194745935965152,0.00017094017094018617,0.00017094017094018617,0.00017094017094018617,0.00017094017094018617,0.00017094017094018617,0.04848509074002047,0.00017094017094018617,0.00017094017094018617,0.00017094017094018617,0.019751119541381687,0.00017094017094018617,0.05475149163123757,0.012130300271457454,0.01083480291118088,0.00017094017094018617,0.00017094017094018617,0.3299265856898406,0.02162211728516856,0.00017094017094018617,0.00017094017094018617,0.00017094017094018617,0.00017094017094018617,0.00017094017094018617,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0

57705,4,"More "" Good Evening 's "" for all ... I ca n't wait for this second season to FINALLY be released . I bought the first set on a whim and WOW was I pleasantly surprised . I never knew Alfred Hitchcock had such a fun personality and such wicked humor before viewing his little intro 's and exits during each episode . This set includes 39 episodes from the 1956 - 1957 season . The casts of each show are superb and the certain actors who show up in other episodes are always welcome as the new characters they play . If you love short , play - like drama 's ( some are comedy 's in a dark vain ) you owe it to yourself to check out both season sets and join me and others who hope that the studio 's will quickly release all of the seasons for us fans .

57710,4,"Wonderfully attractive and relaxing family comedy / Action / Adventure This is really sweet adventurous romp with plenty of action and humor and I really enjoyed watching it . I think it has great replay value and as one of the other reviewers noted you can just switch your brain into neutral and enjoy the silliness . I found it more reminiscent of the old 60 's films like ' Monte Carlo or Bust ' or ' Those Magnificent men .... ' . Jackie Chan rather than trying to take a leading role delights as the action - packed foil to ' Fillius Fogg ' played with brilliant English reserve and self - deprecating humor by ' Steve Coogan ' . There 's no comparison to the original and the film does n't even try to copy . Rather , it takes a silly story with silly character 's puts them in silly situations and with quite considerable imagination and verve makes one of the nicest family action / adventure / comedy movies you 'll see . Because this is n't a typical ' Martial Arts ' vehicle for ' Jackie Chan ' I found that the fight scenes and stunts worked a whole lot better given the storyline . Check out for instance the fight - scene in the Art - Gallery which goes to show why ' Jackie Chan ' is probably the best Action / Comedy star in the world right now . There 's much that 's Chaplain / Keaton - like in his performance and all the stunts are more impressive because you know that he does most all his own stunts . The guest - stars are a nice treat to spot during the travels and again harkens back to the older comedies which used similar devices , most notably ' It 's a Mad , Mad , Mad , Mad World ' ( What I think is the best Comedy ever and this is by no means a comparison ) . Anyway ' Arnold Swarzenneger ' in his awesomely bad wig was a hoot as a Turkish Prince no less ( Possibly the poorest Arabian impression ever , which is of course why it works so well ) and ' Rob Schneider ' has the funniest guest spot as the smellier than smelly bum with poor career advice . Miss ' Cecile de France ' is a beautiful Comedy foil and manages to overcome a limited role to portray a luminous comic talent and I hope to see more from her . You might expect the comedy in the film to be crude or obvious but I found a lot of it to be nicely restrained , this was in part due to great casting and what appeared to be great chemistry on set , check out the extras . All in all a wonderfully attractive and relaxing family comedy / Action / Adventure with ne'er a slow moment and a well paced story that however familiar still manages to please on repeated viewing .",512,1,0.00022222222222224335,0.00022222222222224335,0.00022222222222224335,0.00022222222222224335,0.05055300915536294,0.00022222222222224335,0.00022222222222224335,0.07315185968098045,0.00022222222222224335,0.00022222222222224335,0.00022222222222224335,0.00022222222222224335,0.07020401198706078,0.00022222222222224335,0.00022222222222224335,0.00022222222222224335,0.00022222222222224335,0.00022222222222224335,0.00022222222222224335,0.00022222222222224335,0.48171347347732674,0.15147553508844774,0.00022222222222224335,0.00022222222222224335,0.00022222222222224335,0.014290764196280335,0.00022222222222224335,0.00022222222222224335,0.00022222222222224335,0.00022222222222224335,0.00022222222222224335,0.00022222222222224335,0.00022222222222224335,0.00022222222222224335,0.073762046343957,0.00022222222222224335,0.00022222222222224335,0.011408405469385237,0.00022222222222224335,0.00022222222222224335,0.00022222222222224335,0.00022222222222224335,0.00022222222222224335,0.06432978349008663,0.00022222222222224335,0.00022222222222224335,0.00022222222222224335,0.00022222222222224335,0.00022222222222224335,0.00022222222222224335,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
57713,4,"My favorite movie kiss I was a teenager in the 80 's , so I love all of the old 80 's teen movies , but Some Kind of Wonderful makes my top three . The performances were believable - the actors became the characters , not the other way around . Eric Stoltz is a level headed mechanic from the wrong side of the tracks ( literally ) who wants to pursue art instead of business . Mary Stuart Masterson is his best friend , a tomboy drummer who is secretly in love with him . Lea Thompson is the beautiful girl from their neighborhood who made it into the inner circle of popular rich kids on the basis of her beauty - and her boyfriend . Craig Scheffer is the rich bully boyfriend - and the only off note . Keith ( Eric Stoltz ) is interested in Amanda ( Lea Thompson ) and takes the opportunity to ask her out when she breaks up with her boyfriend . To spite the boyfriend , she says yes . Watts ( Mary Stuart Masterson ) predicts trouble and their friendship is tested . My favorite line from the movie is when Keith defends Amanda , claiming , "" You ca n't judge a book by its cover . "" Watts cynically replies , "" Yeah , but you can tell how much it 's gon na cost . "" Finally Watts agrees to help Keith prepare for the date , including helping him "" practice kissing "" - and it 's a doozy of a kiss . Throw in John Ashton as Keith 's father , Maddie Corman as his meddlesome sister , and Elias Koteas as the scary guy Keith befriends in detention , and you have a "" wonderful "" movie",304,1,0.00046511627906981756,0.0667102374538434,0.00046511627906981756,0.00046511627906981756,0.00046511627906981756,0.027560613204287796,0.00046511627906981756,0.00046511627906981756,0.00046511627906981756,0.00046511627906981756,0.023216111237626614,0.04831279094826653,0.00046511627906981756,0.00046511627906981756,0.00046511627906981756,0.00046511627906981756,0.00046511627906981756,0.00046511627906981756,0.00046511627906981756,0.00046511627906981756,0.6083187351510839,0.00046511627906981756,0.00046511627906981756,0.00046511627906981756,0.00046511627906981756,0.08362602051283187,0.06452842584603881,0.00046511627906981756,0.00046511627906981756,0.00046511627906981756,0.00046511627906981756,0.00046511627906981756,0.00046511627906981756,0.00046511627906981756,0.00046511627906981756,0.00046511627906981756,0.0327088390314556,0.00046511627906981756,0.00046511627906981756,0.00046511627906981756,0.00046511627906981756,0.025948459172702845,0.00046511627906981756,0.00046511627906981756,0.00046511627906981756,0.00046511627906981756,0.00046511627906981756,0.00046511627906981756,0.00046511627906981756,0.00046511627906981756,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

57757,4,"Charming take on the children 's story Before we first rented one of the Barbie videos for my daughter , I was expecting them to be trite , over - commercialised , and over - sugary . However , I have been pleasantly surprised . Yes , they do have a lot of commercial spin - offs and a high saccarine count , but the quality of the Barbie films we have subsequently bought or rented , including "" 12 Dancing Princesses , "" was significantly higher than I had expected . They have not just kept my children engrossed for hours - including my son as well as my daughter - but introduced them to some beautiful stories and truly wonderful music . On more than one occasion I have been listening to a CD of a classic such as Beethoven 's pastoral symphony , or The Queen of the Night 's aria from Mozart 's magic flute , and my daughter has recognised and expressed appreciation of the music , and correctly remembered which Barbie film had used it . ( "" Magic of Pegasus "" and "" Mermaidia "" respectively . ) The soundtrack to "" Twelve Dancing Princesses "" is mostly adapted from some of Mendelsohn 's best work , including "" A Midsummer night 's dream "" and the Scottish and Italian symphonies . It also includes a lullaby sung to the King by the 12 princesses which was based on a 16th century anthem by Byrd , the recording of which was sung beautifully by Melissa Lyons and the Women 's Occidental Glee club . The story is loosely based on the children 's story . "" Barbie "" plays "" Princess Genevieve "" , the seventh of 12 daughters of a widowed King ( e.g. seven young women , plus a pair of twins who appear to be about 11 and a set of triplets who appear to be about 6 . ) Like the original , the story is about 12 princesses who having been banned from dancing , sneak off every night through a magic passage and take a magic barge to a special island where they can dance all night . However , in this version the killjoy who tries to stop them dancing is not the King their father , who loves them very much , but his cousin , Duchess Rowena , who he has brought to the palace to be their tutor . At first even the princesses do not realise quite what a bad mistake this was ... As with many of the Barbie films , comic relief is provided by talking animal companions of some of the principal characaters . In this case Princess Genevieve has a pet cat , and the evil Duchess Rowena has an equally evil pet monkey , Brutus . The hero , who in this version is the royal cobbler , Derek , has a pet parrot , who for some reason talks with a greatly exaggerated Indian accent . ( That 's Indian from the subcontinent , not native American.)Those people who enjoy criticising what the Barbie franchise represents will not have much difficulty finding things in this production to sneer at . If you , or more importantly your kids , are allergic to an excess of twee sweetness , then this film and the Barbie videos generally may not be for them . And the female characters are all on the thin side of plausibility : I 'm not worried that watching this is going to give my daughter anorexia as she likes food too much and has a good sense of the difference between fantasy and reality , but if you are worried that your children may be forming an unrealistic idea about how thin a healthy body shape is , that is a concern with this film . But on the plus side : it is beautifully made , it will hold the attention of most small children for long enough for the typical exhausted parent to clear the mess they have made in several rooms of the house or collapse for an hour 's rest after doing so . Alternatively there are enough more sophisticated jokes thrown in that you wo n't be completely bored to death if you decide to watch it with your offspring . And best of all , the soundtrack is almost worth buying the film for on it 's own",751,1,0.07870778428818778,0.00020408163265308278,0.013009059323251053,0.027556218149497116,0.00020408163265308278,0.012289371958984425,0.010408163281546628,0.09937825584247217,0.045127584057552225,0.00020408163265308278,0.00020408163265308278,0.019077887558404137,0.00020408163265308278,0.00020408163265308278,0.012104940611506984,0.00020408163265308278,0.00020408163265308278,0.00020408163265308278,0.00020408163265308278,0.04904909546093855,0.00020408163265308278,0.00020408163265308278,0.00020408163265308278,0.00020408163265308278,0.012789646538645281,0.016434755662247287,0.00020408163265308278,0.00020408163265308278,0.01856201414803371,0.00020408163265308278,0.00020408163265308278,0.01053277700584072,0.11013963749190776,0.00020408163265308278,0.15427802802795457,0.00020408163265308278,0.00020408163265308278,0.00020408163265308278,0.01779706068341323,0.00020408163265308278,0.00020408163265308278,0.0699957262876968,0.00020408163265308278,0.21643546300967417,0.00020408163265308278,0.00020408163265308278,0.00020408163265308278,0.00020408163265308278,0.00020408163265308278,0.00020408163265308278,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

57778,4,"Anthony Hopkins sets the standard ' The Bunker ' is one of three films that deal with Hitler 's final days as the Soviets encircle Berlin and put an end to the Third Reich in April / May 1945.'The Bunker ' is both one of the best and one of the worst of the three ( the others being 1973 's ' Hitler : the last ten days ' and 2005 's ' Downfall ' ) at the same time . The triumph of ' The Bunker ' is Anthony Hopkins tour de force performance as Hitler , at times so exact it is as if you are watching a newsreel . The element that makes the film almost painful to watch is that almost a 1/3 of it is dedicated to the whitewashing of convicted Nazi war criminal Albert Speer . One thing that makes ' The Bunker ' different from the others is the occasional use of flashbacks , and although brief they do allow Hopkins to portray Hitler in different venues and in a relaxed mode , casually chating and enjoying the company of friends when times were fat . In the bunker itself Hopkins turns Hitler purple in a full throttle rage as he yells about the need to destroy "" the scourge and pestilence of Jewish Marxism!""'Hitler : the last ten days ' does a bit better than the rest in portraying the supporting cast of characters in the drama but one stands out in ' The Bunker ' and that is Michael Lonsdale as Martin Borman , Hitler 's personal secretary and gatekeeper , a man of considerable power who plays his cards close to the vest and is always scheming to stay one step ahead of his rivals . Despite its flaws ' The Bunker ' earns a high rating as the Hopkins performance simply can not be missed .",317,1,0.000454545454545497,0.13711883664345276,0.11304939142250219,0.000454545454545497,0.026525541170762387,0.000454545454545497,0.000454545454545497,0.000454545454545497,0.000454545454545497,0.000454545454545497,0.000454545454545497,0.000454545454545497,0.000454545454545497,0.000454545454545497,0.000454545454545497,0.000454545454545497,0.000454545454545497,0.000454545454545497,0.000454545454545497,0.000454545454545497,0.1800596241747955,0.000454545454545497,0.000454545454545497,0.000454545454545497,0.000454545454545497,0.000454545454545497,0.000454545454545497,0.000454545454545497,0.000454545454545497,0.000454545454545497,0.000454545454545497,0.06392822450509836,0.000454545454545497,0.000454545454545497,0.000454545454545497,0.000454545454545497,0.000454545454545497,0.000454545454545497,0.000454545454545497,0.000454545454545497,0.000454545454545497,0.024537307355136356,0.000454545454545497,0.3685635359161626,0.000454545454545497,0.03455935230046646,0.03302182287525805,0.000454545454545497,0.000454545454545497,0.000454545454545497,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0
57781,4,"Truffaut 's Classic Relationship Triangle as Idiosyncratic , Disconcerting and Mesmerizing as Ever The enduring legacy around Fran � ois Truffaut 's emotionally turbulent 1962 film depends primarily on how compatible the three actors are in inhabiting the triangle at the core of the story adapted from Henri - Pierre Roch � semi - autobiographical novel . And in showing that elusive rapport , Oskar Werner , Henri Serre and especially Jeanne Moreau provide superbly etched characterizations in one of the defining works of the French New Wave . Fortunately , the two - disc Criterion Collection DVD set provides an appropriately rich package for this classic , although the print transfer is frustratingly variable at times . The story focuses on the friendship between two writers , an Austrian named Jules and a Frenchman named Jim , kindred spirits who enjoy a decadent lifestyle in pre - WWI Paris . Inspired by a statue of a woman 's face with a most enigmatic smile , they agree that they are destined to fall in love with a woman with the same smile . Enter Catherine , as seductively capricious a free - spirit as ever there was in cinema , and the two men are instantly enamored . Jules is intent on marrying her , even though it 's clear from the outset that she is not one who could commit for the long term . The war intercedes , and the two friends are fighting on opposite sides . After the war , Catherine , married to Jules and raising their young daughter , is emotionally dissatisfied and embarks on an affair with Jim . With Jules ' blessing , things are idyllic for a while , but Jim proves too much the alpha male to defer to Catherine 's whims , and the resulting imbalance leads to increasingly dramatic consequences . In just his third film , Truffaut 's trademark style emerges with fast cuts between scenes and naturalistic camera movements ( courtesy of Raoul Coutard 's fluid cinematography ) . Moreover , George Delerue 's animated music score and Michel Subor 's voiceover add to the evocative photo - album memory atmosphere . At times , the storyline feels a bit disjointed , but the fulsome performances more than compensate . Werner fully captures the internal struggle within Jules in attempting to reconcile his love for Catherine with her impossible demands on him . Serre has the comparatively more objective role but convincingly shows his character surrendering to the tangled situation . After her impressive turn as an obsessed adulterer in Louie Malle 's "" Elevator to the Gallows "" , Moreau solidifies her vaunted reputation here , conveying Catherine 's petulance and unyielding passion in a vividly mercurial fashion . The DVD extras are abundant starting with two commentary tracks . The first one , a more factual account of the production , was recorded in 1992 with Truffaut collaborator Suzanne Schiffman , editor Claudine Bouche , co - screenwriter Jean Gruault , and scholar Annette Insdorf . The second , produced in 2000 , is far better as it has Moreau sharing her personal recollections of the filming with Truffaut biographer Serge Toubiana . Disc One also includes a brief 1966 interview with Truffaut discussing Roch � and a 1985 featurette , "" The Key to Jules and Jim "" , which contains interviews with the author 's friends as they discuss the inspirations for the characters . Disc Two takes a broader look at Truffaut with five separate interviews with the director over the span of fifteen years , as well as insightful interviews with Coutard and co - screenwriter Jean Gruault",619,1,0.0003333333333333724,0.0003333333333333724,0.0003333333333333724,0.0003333333333333724,0.0003333333333333724,0.0003333333333333724,0.0003333333333333724,0.07219852208251841,0.0003333333333333724,0.0003333333333333724,0.0003333333333333724,0.0003333333333333724,0.0003333333333333724,0.0003333333333333724,0.0003333333333333724,0.0003333333333333724,0.0003333333333333724,0.0003333333333333724,0.0003333333333333724,0.0003333333333333724,0.0003333333333333724,0.0003333333333333724,0.032304576346043154,0.0003333333333333724,0.08980991193227363,0.07151432086867034,0.0003333333333333724,0.0003333333333333724,0.0003333333333333724,0.0003333333333333724,0.0003333333333333724,0.03506021934124734,0.0003333333333333724,0.0003333333333333724,0.0003333333333333724,0.0485515618078756,0.048085652915587515,0.0003333333333333724,0.0003333333333333724,0.0003333333333333724,0.03107484874634158,0.017357665162528388,0.04525365320215689,0.4957890675947557,0.0003333333333333724,0.0003333333333333724,0.0003333333333333724,0.0003333333333333724,0.0003333333333333724,0.0003333333333333724,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

57805,4,"NOT A BAD FILM AT ALL There were loads of Swords and Sorcery films coming out in the 80 's , most of them low budget garbage . But this was actually one of the better films . It had a lot wrong with it , but it had enough good to make it enjoyable . Richard Lynch is Cromwell who plots against the throne , takes power as the young prince Talon ( lee Horsley ) eventually will grow up to challenge the tyrant . Pretty standard stuff . But it 's exectuted well . The opening is stolen directly from Robert E. Howard 's Conan Story "" The Hour of the Dragon "" as Cromwell and his conspirators , including a witch , find an ancient tomb and revive a powerful , ancient sorcerer . In the Conan story the sorcerer 's name was Zaltotun . In this movie , the name is Xusia . Mere coincidence ? I think not . But Xusia is played well be the towering Richard Moll ( of Night Court fame ) . He 's suitably imposing and evil , as he quickly tears the heart out of the witch who helped restore him to life . Unfortunately Xusia does n't get enough screen time . Lynch always does a good job in the role of the villain and does so here , too . Horsley plays his role clearly more influenced by Errol Flynn in Robin Hood than by Conan . He 's a fun - loving reveling rogue leading a band of rogues hoping to take back the throne . He is eventually captured and Cromwell has him nailed to a cross , although it 's an "" X "" cross so as to not upset anyone with religious symbolism . Again , this is a scene lifted from a Conan story "" A Witch Shall be Born "" when Conan was nailed to a cross . Only Conan had to be rescued by desert raiders while Talon , actually pulls the nails out of his own hands and gets up to fight immediately . Now , I 'm no doctor but I 'm guessing that someone who had a 4 "" nail driven through their palms is NOT going to be able to pickup and handle a sword but , ok , it 's fantasy so I 'll buy it . Still , despite some shortcomings , this is an enjoyable little diversion . The ending Credits even gave the title of a sequel which never materialized",428,1,0.00035087719298249027,0.00035087719298249027,0.00035087719298249027,0.00035087719298249027,0.00035087719298249027,0.00035087719298249027,0.00035087719298249027,0.08833760806684418,0.08068803580078149,0.00035087719298249027,0.00035087719298249027,0.00035087719298249027,0.00035087719298249027,0.00035087719298249027,0.00035087719298249027,0.00035087719298249027,0.14354630459001166,0.023529789573411862,0.00035087719298249027,0.00035087719298249027,0.00035087719298249027,0.16575562905684846,0.00035087719298249027,0.00035087719298249027,0.00035087719298249027,0.00035087719298249027,0.00035087719298249027,0.00035087719298249027,0.00035087719298249027,0.00035087719298249027,0.00035087719298249027,0.00035087719298249027,0.00035087719298249027,0.00035087719298249027,0.12362781459060092,0.00035087719298249027,0.00035087719298249027,0.00035087719298249027,0.05110563451400341,0.00035087719298249027,0.00035087719298249027,0.024644401019404162,0.00035087719298249027,0.20441079018239464,0.08031890488639973,0.00035087719298249027,0.00035087719298249027,0.00035087719298249027,0.00035087719298249027,0.00035087719298249027,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0
57808,4,"Highly recommended "" Mighty Quinn "" features a young sexy Denzel Washington ( Xavier Quinn ) as a smart detective who did a stint with the FBI and returns home as police chief on a Carribbean island . There 's a shadowy plot involving $ 10,000 bills , a guerilla movement and guns , but the movie focuses more on Quinn 's conflicts because his childhood friend is suspected of a grisly murder , and Quinn 's own discomfort from having "" made good "" but ending up caught between two worlds , white and black . He 's also caught between the islanders ' desire to protect their own and white political pressure to drop the investigation .

57825,4,"Potentially Promising ; Hence Its Sudden Suffocation CBS 's THRESHOLD held the promise of a good science - fiction thriller ; however regardless of it 's interesting story premise , good acting , and well supported production team , it , like NBC 's "" SURFACE "" and ABC 's "" INVASION "" , was cancelled . Although I considered it the weakest of the three mentioned , it alone was told before production ended , it was not being re - newed ; hence , it had just enough time to provide an adequate series finale and why I rated it 4 vice 3 stars . Was it cancelled because the plot was flimsy or dumb ? Possibly , but it did offer better tv viewing than many of the boob tube 's "" reality "" shows and less than funny comedies . Was it cancelled because it lacked character depth and good acting ? Maybe , but Carla Gugino ( Molly ) , Charles Dutton ( Blaylock ) , Brent Spiner(Fenway ) , Rob Benedict ( Lucas ) , Peter Dinklage ( Ramsey ) , and Brian Holt ( Cavennaugh ) did a very good job trying to provide three dimensions to their characters . Sadly , they did n't have the opportunity to finish the job . Was it cancelled because it did n't get the support it needed from the folks behind the scenes ? Arguably , but the team did offer some great visuals , interesting plotlines , and nightmare scenarios . So why was this potentially promising series suddenly suffocated ? Probably because it cost too much money and the average television viewer does n't appreciate a good story takes time to develop ( The X - Files , Alias , 24 , Law and Order , CSI , Smallville , Numbers , etc.).Is it worth buying or renting ? Yes . Though a cancelled series , it has that one thing most of it 's one season wonders do n't have -- an adequate conclusion that does n't leave you wondering how a cliff - hanger is to be resolved",357,1,0.0003636363636363934,0.0003636363636363934,0.0003636363636363934,0.0003636363636363934,0.0003636363636363934,0.0003636363636363934,0.0003636363636363934,0.0003636363636363934,0.0740298760035044,0.0003636363636363934,0.0003636363636363934,0.0003636363636363934,0.24155249405340268,0.0003636363636363934,0.0236300211497197,0.0003636363636363934,0.10803665434393492,0.0003636363636363934,0.0003636363636363934,0.0003636363636363934,0.0003636363636363934,0.32270309566763855,0.0003636363636363934,0.09185775777851447,0.0003636363636363934,0.0003636363636363934,0.0003636363636363934,0.0003636363636363934,0.0003636363636363934,0.0003636363636363934,0.0003636363636363934,0.0003636363636363934,0.0003636363636363934,0.0003636363636363934,0.07821659946427259,0.027777220838368578,0.0003636363636363934,0.0003636363636363934,0.0003636363636363934,0.0003636363636363934,0.0003636363636363934,0.0003636363636363934,0.0003636363636363934,0.0003636363636363934,0.0003636363636363934,0.017287189791552037,0.0003636363636363934,0.0003636363636363934,0.0003636363636363934,0.0003636363636363934,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

57835,4,"EXCELLENT ! Definitely a great movie , Rules of Engagement , brings to the screen two stories as they unfold simultaneously ; that of a military investigation into whether an officer in the Marines was in violation of the code of conduct during an incident in Yemen , and the inner struggle of the investigator / defence lawyer as he tries to come to terms with his past and the ghosts that have been haunting him ever since Vietnam .... The film combines drama , action and adventure making it one of the best of its kind . Needless to say , Tommy Lee Jones , Samuel Jackson , and the rest of the cast have truly outdone themselves with their performances , which are outstanding to say the least ! All the actors , without exceptions , give it their 100 % and it really shows ( the chemistry is AMAZING)!The plot , the setting , the dialogues , the special effects , and the music are all wonderful!In short , it is a movie definitely worth watching and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection ( if you have n't already done so ) ! !

57851,4,"One of My Favorite Woody Allen Films Up until last years Match Point , Crimes and Misdemeanors was considered Woody Allen 's last great film . I 've only seen 3 Woody Allen films ( not counting Match Point ) that came out after C and M and before MP , but I 'd have to agree . Crimes and Misdemeanors is a film that ranks right up there with Allen 's greatest work . Films like The Purple Rose of Cairo and Annie Hall . It 's a perfect blend of drama and comedy . In fact , Match Point was kind of a retread of this film . The drama without the comedy . This movie stars Martin Landau ( ' Ed Wood ' ) as Judah Rosenthal , an eye - doctor ( I do n't remember the term for one ) who 's been having an affair with a woman named Dolores ( Anjelica Huston , ' Buffalo 66 ' ) . Problem is , he 's tried to break it off but Dolores is n't having it . She 's , instead , threatened to expose his infidelity to his wife . He 's barely intercepted the letters . He looks to a patient , a rabbi ( Sam Waterston , ' The Killing Fields ' ) , for help ... But it 's not working . When he turns to his mobster brother Jack ( Jerry Orbach , ' Law and Order ' ) for help . Jack suggests murder . Judah reluctantly gives in . Meanwhile , a filmmaker named Cliff Stern ( Allen ) is tapped by his brother - in - law Lester ( Alan Alda,'Mahattan Murder Mystery ' ) to make a documentary special on him . Cliff hates Lester , but is n't getting work anywhere else . While working on it , Cliff meets Halley Reed ( Mia Farrow , ' Rosemary 's Baby ' ) whom he falls for , despite being married . In typical Woody Allen style , the film is fueled mostly by conversations between the main characters . I liked his ploy of showing clips of old movies ( as a character was watching them ) that kind of went over what was occurring in his own movie . The movie is separated into comedy and drama , kind of like Allen 's "" Melinda and Melinda . "" The drama part is the Judah plot . The comedy is the Cliff plot . Although both of them drift into the other category occasionally . They both finally come together at the end . The movie simultaneously reminded me of Match Point and Manhattan . The former for obvious reasons , the latter because the endings are similar in what happens to Allen 's character . Anyway , the acting is great of course . As is the dialogue , as always . There 's a lot of great one - liners ( "" I have n't been inside a woman since I visited the statue of Liberty "" ) and some physical bits of humor as well . If you 're a fan of Woody Allen , you 'll definitely love it .

57901,4,"A great reproduction of a great movie with a great set of Extras I need to preface this review with the comment that I am not a John Wayne fan . However "" The Searchers "" is often said to be the Duke 's best movie . And it is clear from here that he was no cardboard cut out actor and , if anything , his real talents were underused in his career . Still "" The Searchers "" is a classic and deserves to be better known . The 50th anniversary edition is a must for any collector . The restored print for the DVD is excellent . Just what you want to watch John Ford 's gorgeous Monument Valley location shots . The "" extras "" disk is also excellent . There are three good documentaries all of which were made with thought and genuine concern . A change from all those "" afterthought "" DVD extras . One documentary features interviews with Martin Scorsese and another some great shots of the film production camp in Monument Valley in the early 1950s , before it was on the tourist trail . The documentaries would be of interest to serious film students and even amateur sociologists , they illustrate the many serious social issues "" The Searchers "" deals with , and takes a serious and humane point of view on , without preaching . A lesson I suppose for today 's "" socially concerned "" film makers , they really need to focus on the film making and the story first . John Ford did and the message is powerful and still relevant today",277,1,0.0003921568627451244,0.0003921568627451244,0.0003921568627451244,0.0003921568627451244,0.10024835248491527,0.0003921568627451244,0.0003921568627451244,0.18779977885955754,0.0003921568627451244,0.0003921568627451244,0.0003921568627451244,0.0003921568627451244,0.0003921568627451244,0.0003921568627451244,0.0003921568627451244,0.0003921568627451244,0.0003921568627451244,0.05586851171331228,0.0003921568627451244,0.0003921568627451244,0.08252118233531147,0.0003921568627451244,0.0003921568627451244,0.025743794038154647,0.0003921568627451244,0.025455158233500978,0.03456591228865994,0.0003921568627451244,0.0003921568627451244,0.0003921568627451244,0.0003921568627451244,0.0003921568627451244,0.0003921568627451244,0.0003921568627451244,0.0003921568627451244,0.0003921568627451244,0.0003921568627451244,0.0003921568627451244,0.12010132987437028,0.0003921568627451244,0.0003921568627451244,0.0003921568627451244,0.0003921568627451244,0.30792324708817126,0.04408645857424123,0.0003921568627451244,0.0003921568627451244,0.0003921568627451244,0.0003921568627451244,0.0003921568627451244,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0

57923,4,"Very Funny , A Great Movie "" Annie Hall "" is one of the most acclaimed romantic comedies of all time . The film not only holds a place on The American Film Institute 's Top 100 ( # 31 ) , as well as The American Film Institute 's Top 100 Comedies ( # 4 ) . The film took home 4 Academy Awards including Best Picture and Best Director ; The film is also without a doubt one of the best romantic - comedies ever made . It really nails that awkwardness of romance . I think few of us are like the neurotic Woody Allen and I do n't so much mean the way the characters act , but the way they think and stuff like that is totally realistic . Woody Allen plays Alvy Singer , a comeddian who always knocks it out of the park when it comes to comedy but ca n't really get a grip on love . He 's been through two marriages and is a little bit neurotic , which turns people off . Then his friend Rob ( Tony Roberts ) introduces him to Annie Hall ( the wonderful Diane Keaton ) . Annie is a little bit ditzy and not quite as smart as Alvy , but the two click and begin a relationship that ( to say the least ) has it 's share of ups and downs . Now , not only is the plot and the dialogue and everything true - to - life but this film is also absolutely hilarious . When I see a movie on AFI 's Top 100 Comedies , I tend to shy away from the films on that list . Not because they 're not good , it 's just that they do n't really pick by what 's the funniest film ever . Example , ' The 40 Year Old Virgin ' was funnier than their number 1 pick Some Like It Hot . But anyway , Annie Hall actually is very funny . The dialogue is quick - witted , some the scenes have become classics ( Allen sneezing on the cocaine ) . In an era where romantic comedies run rampant into movie theatres , it 's nice to go back and see the films that really made the genre what it is . This is a great film , a great romantic - comedy , a Woody Allen masterpiece .

57926,4,"ROURKE , ROBERTS , SINATRA SINGS "" SUMMER WIND "" What more can you ask for ( Lou Monte doing LUNA LUNA LUNA , it 's here ) . POPE is Vincent Patrick 's best written work and his screenplay works with Rourke and Roberts doing each other justice in the lead roles . The inside buzz is Michael Cimino sat in the directors chair , but evidence to the contrary is offered : The film is less than 3 hours in length and significantly lacks metaphors . Instead , POPE is a raucous and likeable tale of NYC bottom feeders whose only place in Trump Tower would be behind a broom .

57944,4,"The Inimitable DR . NO We have all heard about ` Product Placement ' especially in the James Bond films . Did you know it goes all the way back to DR . NO and was very prominent ? In the scene where Bond kicks and tosses Quarrel and Puss Feller into a stack of corrugated cartons , notice that those cartons are labeled ` Red Stripe . ' That 's right , ` Red Stripe ' Beer from Jamaica ! In this case ` Product Placement ' was not a bad thing because it adds to the authenticity of this film . In fact DR . NO is one of the best films of the series . It is much closer to Ian Fleming 's prose than most of the other films thanks to Sean Connery 's performance , Richard Maibaum 's scripting and Terence Young 's direction . At the same time other elements that would be unique to the series and distinguish it from other films were introduced here . Production designer Ken Adam 's sets , attractively futuristic yet totally simplistic and functional , adorned by Syd Cain 's detailed Art designs set the look for the entire series making their work in DR . NO the benchmark . Peter Hunt 's intuitive and effective quick - cut editing paced the film like no other at its time . Maurice Binder 's brainchild opening ` gun barrel ' is an incredible piece of Title Design , which is equaled only by the ` James Bond Theme ' , composed and re - orchestrated by Monty Norman and John Barry . Ted Moore 's cinematography , especially the shot of bikini clad Ursula Andress emerging from the sea , is now a classic and also set a standard for future ` Bond Girls . ' We are introduced to the organization known as S.P.E.C.T.R.E. in DR . NO . What is unique to this film is the main villain brilliantly portrayed by Joseph Wiseman . He is unlike future main villains of the series . He is n't exactly what you may call a ` social animal ' . Joseph Wiseman 's eerie and surreptitious portrayal made Dr. No one of the most mysterious and enigmatic of the series . In a way his portrayal seems like a model for the unseen Blofeld in FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE and THUNDERBALL . Rounded out by the beloved M portrayed by Bernard Lee , the lovely Miss Moneypenny played by Lois Maxwell , John Kitzmiller as Quarrel and Zena Marshall as Miss Taro , DR . NO ranks as one of the best .",445,1,0.000327868852459044,0.000327868852459044,0.000327868852459044,0.017932561179245538,0.000327868852459044,0.000327868852459044,0.000327868852459044,0.11333170599135957,0.023227243989424773,0.000327868852459044,0.04772289204230839,0.000327868852459044,0.09880785064354375,0.000327868852459044,0.000327868852459044,0.000327868852459044,0.000327868852459044,0.000327868852459044,0.000327868852459044,0.000327868852459044,0.000327868852459044,0.000327868852459044,0.000327868852459044,0.09975526409623701,0.000327868852459044,0.07001602413569659,0.000327868852459044,0.000327868852459044,0.000327868852459044,0.000327868852459044,0.000327868852459044,0.000327868852459044,0.000327868852459044,0.000327868852459044,0.000327868852459044,0.000327868852459044,0.000327868852459044,0.000327868852459044,0.000327868852459044,0.000327868852459044,0.000327868852459044,0.000327868852459044,0.000327868852459044,0.5154359661189045,0.000327868852459044,0.000327868852459044,0.000327868852459044,0.000327868852459044,0.000327868852459044,0.000327868852459044,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
57953,4,"The Sublime and the Ridiculous Most of this movie is terrible , but who 's complaining ? The epically long "" Begin the Beguine "" is the climax of the movie and it makes the whole mess worthwhile . The last 11 minutes of this movie are mind - blowingly great -- absolute perfection . The sets , the cinematography , the costumes , the orchestrations and the extraordinary routine itself -- everything combines to make "" Begin the Beguine "" the most ravishing , glamorous black and white production number ever put on film . It 's Hollywood at its apogee , the quintessence of silver screen glamor . A few of the other numbers are fun : the first , "" Do n't Monkey with Broadway "" is clever and pleasant ; later on , Fred Astaire 's lovely "" I 've Got My Eyes on You "" is also winning : a charming routine that he dances to a delightful , cheerful orchestration . Some other numbers are worth seeing , as well , but "" Begin the Beguine "" outshines everything else in this picture . In between the numbers , there 's a lot of dreary silliness afoot . Happily , DVD technology makes it easy to skip over the dross and go straight for the gold . Eleanor Powell was a very odd actress . She was rather pretty and decidedly perky ( how much you go for perky will determine how agreeable you find her personality ) ; she was also quite feminine . Why , then , does she speak out of the side of her mouth like a gangster ? She often sounds like a distaff Edward G. Robinson ( "" Dat was SWELL , Johnny , SWELL ! Nyah ! "" ) .

57974,4,"BERGMANIA ! Probably the best place to start for Bergman initiates . Three decent films ( although I think "" Through A Glass "" is in a different class to the other two features ) . Moreover , they all form a useful overview of the progression of Bergman 's art from circa 1960 to circa ' 62 ; from the religious torment of 1961 's "" Winter light "" , through the conjunction of interpersonal conflict and religious neurosis of "" Through A Glass ... "" to the explicit focus on familial relationships of "" The Silence "" , ( the latter reminiscent of Bergman 's mid - to - late 60 's output ) . In short , although there is nothing to match the astounding "" Persona "" ( 1966 ) , the films do give a great indication as to Bergman 's filmmaking in particular and the whole boom in Euroean Art House cinema of the early 1960s in general . DVD : Excellent Criterion transfers . The documentary disc a Swedish film about the production of "" Winter Light "" ) is excellent as well , worth watching alone for Bergman 's casual conversations on his religious torment : he speaks of spiritual angst in the tone most people speak of going to the shops for a loaf of bread",225,1,0.0006896551724138549,0.0006896551724138549,0.0006896551724138549,0.0006896551724138549,0.0006896551724138549,0.0006896551724138549,0.0006896551724138549,0.0006896551724138549,0.19066743420553697,0.0006896551724138549,0.0006896551724138549,0.0006896551724138549,0.0006896551724138549,0.0006896551724138549,0.0006896551724138549,0.0006896551724138549,0.0006896551724138549,0.0006896551724138549,0.0006896551724138549,0.07410192405751455,0.0006896551724138549,0.04603149005793797,0.0006896551724138549,0.0006896551724138549,0.0006896551724138549,0.0006896551724138549,0.06254125199230229,0.0006896551724138549,0.0006896551724138549,0.03837750742512827,0.0006896551724138549,0.0006896551724138549,0.0006896551724138549,0.0006896551724138549,0.0006896551724138549,0.0006896551724138549,0.0006896551724138549,0.0006896551724138549,0.0006896551724138549,0.0006896551724138549,0.0006896551724138549,0.0006896551724138549,0.0006896551724138549,0.5579355646753704,0.0006896551724138549,0.0006896551724138549,0.0006896551724138549,0.0006896551724138549,0.0006896551724138549,0.0006896551724138549,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
57976,4,"Soldier of Orange - DVD with commentary by Verhoeven Soldier of Orange with commentary by Director Paul Verhoeven is a must - see for all history buffs , WWII historians and lovers of war movies . Based on the life of Erik Haselhoff Roelfzema , it chronicles his life in the resistance and that of a small group of law students in Leiden , The Netherlands . Verhoeven 's commentary is worth the price of the DVD as he explains scene by scene what he tried to portray , while asking some very thought provoking questions . Verhoeven and I are the same age , and both of us lived in Holland during the occupation . His view of the conditions in Holland and the responses of the Dutch under occupation are very different . I also think his references to Das England Spiel are inaccurate . Having said all that , I still consider the DVD one of my most favorite productions , including the film itself . Soldaat van Oranje is my choice for best ever Dutch film .

57978,4,"The Forgotten 30 's Horrors of MGM and Warners This is a wonderful collection of horror pictures made by MGM and Warner Brothers during the Thirties . Neither studio was noted for horror pictures , but the ones they did make are unforgettable to fans of the genre as well as late night movie addicts . Following is a synopsis of the films contained in the collection : THE MASK OF FU MANCHU ( MGM , 1932 ) - Boris Karloff is wonderfully creepy as Sax Rohmer 's evil genius , Dr. Fu Manchu . It would not be the last time Karloff played a Chinese , as he later starred as Mr. Wong in Monogram 's low budget detective series later in the decade . The plot concerns a race between good guy Lewis Stone and Fu Manchu to find the tomb of Ghengis Khan . If Fu Manchu gets there first he will possess the magical relics placed there which , in turn , will allow him to enslave the world . Look for a young Myrna Loy in a delightful turn as Fu 's diabolical , and scantily - clad , daughter . DOCTOR X ( WB , 1932 ) - A good early effort by Michael Curtiz concerning the "" Moon Killer "" murders in which the victims are strangled , cannibalized and surgically dissected under the light of the full moon . Wise - cracking reporter Lee Tracy traces the clues to a spooky seaside mansion , where Dr. Xavier ( Lionel Atwill ) and his colleagues are conducting strange experiments . Made in early two - strip Technicolor , the film is wonderfully atmospheric , and the sets themselves will linger in your mind . Aside from the irritating Lee Tracy as reporter Lee Taylor , the acting is crisp and to the point . Atwill in particular is eerie . Fay Wray is good as Xavier 's daughter . I wo n't give any more of the plot away , but just remember the phrase "" synthetic flash . "" Once heard , it will linger in the mind always . MARK OF THE VAMPIRE ( MGM , 1935 ) - Tod Browning 's remake of his "" London After Midnight "" with Bela Lugosi as the vampire , Count Mora , and Lionel Atwill as Inspector Newman . In the original , both roles were played by Lon Chaney . The plot concerns the death of Sir Karell Borotyn , who appears to have been killed by vampire Count Mora . Fearing that the vampire 's next victim will be Borotyn 's daughter , Irena ( Elizabeth Allan ) , vampire expert Professor Zelen ( Lionel Barrymore ) is called I to protect her and shed some light on the goings - on . Look for Carroll Borland as the Count 's daughter ( a role played by Edna Tichenor in the original).MAD LOVE ( MGM , 1935 ) - One of the great plots in horror film history , and one that has been repeated many times . Colin Clive plays the brilliant concert pianist Stephen Orlac , whose hands are crushed in a train accident . His wife , Yvonne , is a noted stage actress whose ardent admirer is Dr. Gogol ( Peter Lorre ) . Although she rejected Gogol previously , she is forced to seek his help in restoring her husband 's hands . Gogol replaces Orlac 's hands with those of executed knife thrower Rollo , and the fun begins . Clive is his usual tortured , neurotic self and Lorre is brilliant as the oily monomaniacal Gogol . Pauline Keal , in her book on Citizen Kane , stated that Welles copied Lorre 's look for the older Kane . THE DEVIL DOLL ( MGM , 1936 ) - Tod Browning 's last great film is about as respected Parisian banker ( Lionel Barrymore ) , who is framed for robbery and murder and sent to Devil 's Island . Years later he escapes in the company of a scientist who has discovered a way to shrink living things to one - sixth their original size . Barrymore finds a new use for the scientist 's discovery as a means of revenge on those who had framed him . THE RETURN OF DOCTOR X ( WB , 1939 ) - The famous Humphrey Bogart punishment picture ! After years of complaining about his one - dimensional gangster roles , it was said that Jack Warner decided to teach Bogie a lesson and put him in the role of a vampiric lab assistant who needs freshly drained blood in order to stay alive . Bogart is a hoot in pasty - faced white makeup and a grey streak through his hair . Wayne Morris play the wise - cracking reporter who exposes Bogie as the killer . ( Tough job considering the makeup ) . Look for Olin Howard ( Jensen the drunk in Them ! and the Blob 's first victim ) as the undertaker .

57991,4,"All Time Classic Masterful pretty much says it all . I agree with the reveiwers who rated it "" one of the best all time movies""---not just among westerns . This film is Wayne 's HIGH NOON . The hard edges play well with today 's viewers and the things we confront . You will travel with the Duke as he is consumed by hate . He 's not out to save the young lady , but to destroy her . What will happen when he is face to face with her ? Watch and enjoy a great film !

57996,4,"Arguably the best of the movies Wrath Of The Dragon . INTRODUCTION : The Dragon Ball Z series is one of the finest animes out there , as any fan of Japanese animation will tell you . The series has a "" love it or hate it "" reputation , but those fans who get into the series are totally immersed by it for a number of reasons . Young people love the series for the fast - paced action and adventure , while older fans enjoy it for the sheer number of characters , and the way they are developed and evolve over the course of time . It 's no wonder the series is considered Akira Toriyama 's magnum opus , and by far the best of the three Dragon Ball series . When Toei animation made Dragon Ball into an anime , they did n't copy Toriyama 's mangas verbatim . They added in many sagas and plot elements not in the manga , often as a result so that the manga and anime were released at the same pace . Toei even created movies based on the series ! There were thirteen movies , two television specials , and one OVA / OAV . While not usually canon to the storyline , they are an undeniable part of the Dragon Ball Z franchise that ca n't be ignored . OVERVIEW : This is the thirteenth of the thirteen Dragon Ball Z movies . THE STORY : Majin Buu is beaten . Our heroes have won . Peace has returned . Yeah , right . Just as everyone has settled down , Gohan and Videl rescue an old suicidal man , and help him to unlock the seal on a music box of his using the Dragon Balls . What they do n't know is that this old man is from a race of warlocks who once unleashed a great evil upon the universe . The Z Fighters must join forces with a warrior who came from within the music box to fight against this unspeakable evil that once terrorized the universe . But are they strong enough?REVIEW OF STORY : This is one of my favorite Dragon Ball Z movies , due in no small part to the unique storyline , and some battle scenes that are absolutely spectacular . Granted , I wish Vegeta had a larger role , but no big complaints there . There is no other part of the Dragon Ball Z series that has a storyline anything like this . The interaction between Trunks and Tapion is excellent as well . And the ending ? Let 's just say it stands on a plane all its own . You wo n't want to miss it . OFFICIAL?This is a rare example of a Dragon Ball Z movie that could have taken place in the actual series storyline . Right after the defeat of Buu , this would fit into the actual series continuity . It did n't exist in the original manga so I consider it unofficial , but you be the judge . REVIEW OF DVD : All of FUNimation 's Dragon Ball Z DVDs are pretty much the same as far as content goes . There is no bonus content , unless you consider the obligatory trailers on the DVD to be bonus material . And honestly , I could have lived without them . Some more recent DVDs have character profiles , though these are lacking and could have been written better . Why could n't get get interviews with cast and crew , or trivia / facts , something like that ? FUNimation has a lot of room to improve on the DVDs . THE DUBBED VERSION : Lots of people tend to bash FUNimation 's dub of the Dragon Ball Z series ? Why ? It 's inaccurate and sometimes just plain stupid . They can do good dubbed versions for plenty of other animes , such as Full Metal Alchemist , but every time they 've tried dubbing Toriyama 's classic , they butcher it to hell . The nu metal they put in as background music only further defiles the original series . Stick with the uncut subbed track . OVERALL : Get it . Dragon Ball Z movies do n't get any better than this . EDITION NOTES : It was released in edited and uncut versions . Do I even have to say it ? Get uncut . And watch the subtitled Japanese version .",763,1,0.00016393442622952175,0.00016393442622952175,0.00016393442622952175,0.00016393442622952175,0.00016393442622952175,0.00016393442622952175,0.00016393442622952175,0.00016393442622952175,0.028996749373537276,0.00016393442622952175,0.00016393442622952175,0.00016393442622952175,0.02205581010436491,0.00016393442622952175,0.00016393442622952175,0.00016393442622952175,0.00016393442622952175,0.024125621234300208,0.00016393442622952175,0.00016393442622952175,0.448914652023448,0.00016393442622952175,0.00016393442622952175,0.233542452191209,0.015282354801456021,0.00016393442622952175,0.03242668961086134,0.00016393442622952175,0.01664865747549886,0.00016393442622952175,0.00016393442622952175,0.00016393442622952175,0.07687327623613559,0.00016393442622952175,0.00016393442622952175,0.00016393442622952175,0.00016393442622952175,0.00016393442622952175,0.00016393442622952175,0.00016393442622952175,0.00016393442622952175,0.00016393442622952175,0.00856938886045059,0.00016393442622952175,0.08617090546578693,0.00016393442622952175,0.00016393442622952175,0.00016393442622952175,0.00016393442622952175,0.00016393442622952175,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0
57999,4,"I love Chef ! , but I am disappointed in this DVD collection I am a huge Chef ! fan . I have been watching the show since it was on BBC America and my local PBS station . I was excited to find that the "" Complete Collection "" was finally available on DVD . I got the package and could not wait to start watching the show and that is when the dissappointment sat in . I realized that shows were missing from the "" Complete Collection "" like : Divorice ? , Gareth 's Father and the Christmas Special "" A Bird in the hand "" . Can someone please tell me how this can be the "" Complete Collection "" with those episodes ommitted from the DVD ?",132,1,0.0007407407407407842,0.0007407407407407842,0.0007407407407407842,0.0007407407407407842,0.0007407407407407842,0.0007407407407407842,0.03777777801858971,0.0007407407407407842,0.0007407407407407842,0.0007407407407407842,0.0376644424996999,0.0007407407407407842,0.0007407407407407842,0.0007407407407407842,0.0007407407407407842,0.0007407407407407842,0.12807810490978233,0.27436592086942285,0.0007407407407407842,0.0007407407407407842,0.0007407407407407842,0.0007407407407407842,0.0007407407407407842,0.05797634136044094,0.0007407407407407842,0.04986480305482002,0.0007407407407407842,0.0007407407407407842,0.0007407407407407842,0.0007407407407407842,0.0007407407407407842,0.0007407407407407842,0.0007407407407407842,0.0007407407407407842,0.0007407407407407842,0.3029901235466861,0.0007407407407407842,0.0007407407407407842,0.0007407407407407842,0.0007407407407407842,0.0007407407407407842,0.03777777777854223,0.0007407407407407842,0.0007407407407407842,0.0007407407407407842,0.04313433759164375,0.0007407407407407842,0.0007407407407407842,0.0007407407407407842,0.0007407407407407842,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
