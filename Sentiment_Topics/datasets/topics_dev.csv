104,0,Worst pile of drivel to date ! Everyone involved with this production should be ashamed of themselves . Not one single element of the movie was anything slightly like an original idea .

127,0,"I do n't even understand what they tried to accomplish with this movie , i mean really . You got this guy running from a bunch of cats , because he 's dead , but in order to be really dead this girl has to shoot them ? And they leave a corpse even though normal people ca n't see them because their dead ? The script already has a hole in it the size of Nebraska , then you have the main character played by Susan Paterno who just drones up her lines in a monotone , boring voice and with so little emotion on her face she might as well have starred as a female terminator robot . It 's absolutely horrendous and I do n't even understand how I managed to see it all the way to the end of the movie . The end being just as stupid as the entire movie mind you , and with absolutely no reward in it for the viewer what so ever .

187,0,"Two years after this movie was made , "" The Juror "" came out . Do n't waste your time on this one . See "" The Juror "" instead . "" The Juror "" is essentially the same story as "" Trial By Jury , "" with better acting , better directing and a far more gripping aura about it .

355,0,"I watched 5 % of this movie tonight and you may tell me that I need to see the whole movie to understand it , but frankly I do n't think so . What the hell is the story in this movie ? I saw a lot of people running around in a factory , shooting at everything around them . Where to start ? Okay .. 1 ) They were shooting around the place as if it was the Terminator or something they were trying to kill . The entire place is made of metal , but not a single bullet sparked on the metallic surfaces.2 ) No ricochet . Metal vs metal is bound to cause ricochets , but apparently no one got hit by a stray bullet.3 ) Magic bullets ? In one scene a bad - guy is standing right in front of a good - guy when another good - guy pops out behind the bad - guy and pumps him full of metal . You see the bullets exit his chest as it explodes in a bloody mist , but the good - guy right in front of him does n't get hurt at all ! 4 ) After having just splattered a human being all over the wall , the two good - guys tell each other some jokes and they laugh and look like teenagers playing with soft - guns.5 ) Sound ? At one point the good - guys cut a wire and an alarm goes off ( who the hell cuts a wire just to set off an alarm ? ) . The lady screams out "" Alarm in sector blah blah "" and the bad - guy boss says "" Okay .. this .. is .. not .. a .. drill .. blah blah "" in a very , very amateur kinda way . Ooh , we 're getting ambushed by terrorists , this is n't a drill , but I 'm gon na sound like I do n't give crap.6 ) Focus ! ! First you see the bad - guys load up on weapons . For some reason the same guy gets the same Uzi twice . Deja vu or loop of scenes ? You literally see every single bad - guy receive the same kind of weapon and they lock and load the same way . The weapons dealer pops in the clip and the bad - guy extra no . XX locks and loads . When they started opening fire you HAD to see the barrel flashes . Boooring ! ! 7 ) Actors or dummies ? One of the presumed good - guys throw down a smoke grenade for some reason and of course the bad - guys are suddenly inside the smoke because they 're smoke - blind or something so they do n't see it coming . They cough and moan as if it was Anthrax in the grenade . Then a semi - boss bad - guy arrives and he does n't even cough when he enters the smoke , he just pushes the other bad - guys away and they suddenly realize that the smoke is n't Anthrax anyway.8 ) B flick ? I think yeah ! A guy sliding down a metal pipe wielding a Uzi in his right hand shooting away at someone in his eye height apparently . I 'd like to see a guy fire a Uzi with one hand and I 'd like to see him go get his hand afterwards . Extra bloody gore mess in a B flick kinda way . Small * pops * and a red hole with a torn shirt indicates that this guy is dead . Though the first bullet hit his heart the good - guy who is a super trained green berets still feel the urge to empty his clip into the dead guy.9 ) One of these mentioned trained soldiers jump out from his hide with an empty clip ! How stupid can you be ! ? Always check your clip before facing an unknown amount of enemies ! 10 ) Boring scenes . Like the barrel flash scenes and the lock and load scenes , the movie is filled with time wasting scenes of people running around in an apparently empty building .

463,0,"Whilst this is most definitely a well crafted piece of film - making , it 's thoroughly without any entertainment value whatsoever . If you 're depressed already , this film will send you over the edge . If you 're feeling somewhat depressed , this film will be just one more thing in your life to feel bitter about . You 'll feel that it 's just your luck to have chosen to watch a movie that turns out to be a complete waste of time . Otherwise you might be able to make it through this film unscathed ( I did n't , BTW ) , safe in the knowledge that your life is so much better than Jim 's . Then again you might consider that you have been fooling yourself , and that are in fact in a much worse situation than you 'd previously realized . You might feel a bit annoyed at Jim for bringing this to your attention . You may want to slap him around a bit with a wet fish . The sad truth is , much as I wanted to like this movie ... I hated it . It took rather a long miserable road down the path of oblivion and then suddenly , for no reason whatsoever , looked back at itself and then stopped . Jim does not have an epiphany , at least not one that is conveyed on screen . Jim has a miserable life and a miserable set of options . He discovers nothing that one can relate to and fails to make any significant progress on his journey of self - discovery . Of course no - one alive could write a happy ending to this movie . As others have said it 's no Hollywood tale , it 's gritty and it 's real . It 's well made . Life is quite a struggle at times . If anyone were to know "" the answer "" , they do well to shout it from the rooftops . Still , I feel cheated because this movie pretends to have something to say . You feel that it 's going to say something , that if you just suffer through a little more of it , it 'll have something to say . It 'll make you stop and think . It doesn't . Again , I do submit that this is a well crafted film . And therefore may be of value to a film student with a penchant for e.g. lighting techniques of the use of colour palettes . For the rest of us , it 's utterly miss - able .",450,0,0.0002500000000000237,0.0002500000000000237,0.0002500000000000237,0.0002500000000000237,0.0002500000000000237,0.0002500000000000237,0.0002500000000000237,0.05858162379838021,0.0002500000000000237,0.0002500000000000237,0.0002500000000000237,0.0002500000000000237,0.060402882815493296,0.0002500000000000237,0.0002500000000000237,0.0002500000000000237,0.0002500000000000237,0.0002500000000000237,0.0002500000000000237,0.0002500000000000237,0.1595190385920655,0.0002500000000000237,0.0002500000000000237,0.0002500000000000237,0.013564704584154617,0.01226760687436484,0.0002500000000000237,0.0002500000000000237,0.0002500000000000237,0.0002500000000000237,0.0002500000000000237,0.0002500000000000237,0.0002500000000000237,0.0002500000000000237,0.034528336665447946,0.0002500000000000237,0.0002500000000000237,0.0002500000000000237,0.0002500000000000237,0.052541153683967445,0.0002500000000000237,0.0002500000000000237,0.0002500000000000237,0.38338849025494226,0.2149561627311831,0.0002500000000000237,0.0002500000000000237,0.0002500000000000237,0.0002500000000000237,0.0002500000000000237,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0

Why is this film made like a Disney movie . After about fifteen minutes it starts getting good with the gore and all . There 's 2 awesome killings then the movie goes straight to poop .

744,0,"I truly hate and despise this film and the filmmakers behind it . Sure , I 'm all for making a hard hitting and honest film about youth and youth culture.1987 's "" River 's Edge "" is an excellent example of a well - made teen drama . However , what I take exception to is the infantile , grubby and sensationalist approach that the makers of "" 2:37 "" took . A prime example is how it raises so many issues and yet fails in any significant way to comment or reach a resolution on even one of them . My other major problem with this film , apart from its complete plagiarism of Gus Van Sant 's "" Elephant "" ( surprised Van Sant did n't sue ) is its ' bull loose in a china shop ' attitude to quite delicate issues such as incest and particularly suicide . In short , avoid this film like the plague and anything that this filmmaker ever is involved with subsequently .

765,0,"Given the budget and the inexperience of everyone involved , Livin ' tha Life could have been worse . Jamal wants to be Chris Tucker ( whom I 've always found very annoying ) , as a previous commentator has noted , but Peanut ( Edward D. Smith ) , while some of his ( over)reactions go on way too long ( a director 's problem ) , has some comparatively subtle and funny moments , such as when he is trying to instruct Jamal on the proper method of smoking a joint with a buddy . Throughout , he is usually more poised and self - possessed than Jamal , which could have been the germ of a nice exploration of the contrasts in the relationship but was n't developed very far . But the inexperience of the writer / director / cinematographer / etc . is no excuse for his inattention . Has he ever seen a movie ? Faces are important ! Has he ever heard of a closeup ? Even Ed Wood could do a closeup . I do n't think it 's much of a budget issue . I could only give a general description of what any of the actors look like , and not just because of no closeups , but the lighting ... ! Lights for outdoor shooting may cost too much , but you can make a reflector with pieces of paper ! That would have required moving the camera closer to keep the reflector out of the shot , helping to solve the closeup problem at the same time . If that 's too technical you can turn the actors around so they are not in shadow , or you can expose for the shadows , and if it had n't been shot in L.A. I 'd say take advantage of cloudy days . It goes without saying that the movies this one steals from are all , with the possible exception of Weekend at Bernie 's , better than this one , but Livin ' tha Life would have left a much better impression if it had n't made the viewer squint all the way through just to catch a glimpse of whatever the human element might have been . P.S. The scene in the barbershop is just stupid .",391,0,0.41361054331718583,0.00038461538461541703,0.00038461538461541703,0.00038461538461541703,0.00038461538461541703,0.00038461538461541703,0.00038461538461541703,0.04934523821337795,0.00038461538461541703,0.00038461538461541703,0.00038461538461541703,0.00038461538461541703,0.00038461538461541703,0.00038461538461541703,0.00038461538461541703,0.00038461538461541703,0.00038461538461541703,0.00038461538461541703,0.00038461538461541703,0.00038461538461541703,0.24784346283064645,0.00038461538461541703,0.00038461538461541703,0.00038461538461541703,0.00038461538461541703,0.00038461538461541703,0.00038461538461541703,0.00038461538461541703,0.00038461538461541703,0.00038461538461541703,0.00038461538461541703,0.00038461538461541703,0.00038461538461541703,0.00038461538461541703,0.00038461538461541703,0.00038461538461541703,0.00038461538461541703,0.00038461538461541703,0.00038461538461541703,0.00038461538461541703,0.00038461538461541703,0.00038461538461541703,0.00038461538461541703,0.27150844794648055,0.00038461538461541703,0.00038461538461541703,0.00038461538461541703,0.00038461538461541703,0.00038461538461541703,0.00038461538461541703,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
787,0,"This movie is awful beyond belief . It 's a low - budget , badly written , piece of pointless garbage . But the Saturday afternoon I stumbled across it on TV still sticks in my mind as one of the most entertaining I 've ever spent in front of the television . The badness of this movie is epic -- maybe not Ed Wood epic , but close . The premise is hysterical ( men are banned for being too dangerous and imprisoned in -- haw ! -- football stadiums ) , the pseudo - dyke culture is laughably bizarre ( there 's an underground sex trade with women who dress up like men to service "" deviants "" ) and the "" last man "" of the title is a pitiful reincarnation of Rocky from Rocky Horror Picture Show . I did n't get to see the end of it , which I have to assume was so dripping with syrupy "" what have we all learned from this ? "" nonsense it would bring on an urge to brush the teeth , but everything in the first two - thirds was so memorably bad , even if the last third turned out to be a pale imitation of the rest , it 's still worthwhile for anyone who gets a kick out of campy , stupid , brainless sci - fi B - flicks .",238,0,0.0006666666666667307,0.0006666666666667307,0.0006666666666667307,0.0006666666666667307,0.0006666666666667307,0.034527998450166186,0.0006666666666667307,0.16629226992734628,0.0006666666666667307,0.0006666666666667307,0.0006666666666667307,0.0006666666666667307,0.0006666666666667307,0.0006666666666667307,0.033999728920419935,0.0006666666666667307,0.0006666666666667307,0.0006666666666667307,0.0006666666666667307,0.0006666666666667307,0.6983549723316607,0.0006666666666667307,0.0006666666666667307,0.0006666666666667307,0.0006666666666667307,0.0006666666666667307,0.0006666666666667307,0.0006666666666667307,0.0006666666666667307,0.03682503037040422,0.0006666666666667307,0.0006666666666667307,0.0006666666666667307,0.0006666666666667307,0.0006666666666667307,0.0006666666666667307,0.0006666666666667307,0.0006666666666667307,0.0006666666666667307,0.0006666666666667307,0.0006666666666667307,0.0006666666666667307,0.0006666666666667307,0.0006666666666667307,0.0006666666666667307,0.0006666666666667307,0.0006666666666667307,0.0006666666666667307,0.0006666666666667307,0.0006666666666667307,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
1088,0,"Director J.S. Cardone presents something a little scary and a little creepy , but nothing more . A widowed mother Karen Tunny(Lori Heuring)inherits a home in the Pennsylvania mountains ; so she takes her two daughters and moves into the sprawling estate in what seems the middle of nowhere . But it is somewhere , somewhere ninety some odd years ago a tragic mining accident claimed the lives of numerous children who were forced to labor in the dark and dank . The area and especially the Tunny estate seems to be haunted by the spirits of the tiny little wicked souls .

1357,0,"This movie is so bad , they would n't buy it back at my local used CD / DVD store . I only own it because it came in a box set which I bought for the masterpiece "" Deadfall "" . The store bought back the other two movies I was selling from the four disc set , but they would n't buy back Underworld , and those other two movies redefined rank , so what does that say about this movie ? So I tried to sell it back to another store , that even bought back budget DVDs that you could buy for a dollar at a local store , but they would n't buy back Underworld either . This movie is bad on every level , and is one of those that came out in the post - Tarantino - clone glut of the mid 90 's .

1439,0,"I 'm a big fan of Thomas Harris , I read all his novels at least 5 times and Hannibal 's the book I really love the most . Therefore the movie was my biggest disappointment and I really do n't get it why some folks here give it a nine or even a ten . Either their demands are very low or they have n't read the book or both . Even if I had n't read the book I 'd still consider the movie as absolute average and I 'd give it a five . The creepy , mysterious atmosphere from the novel does n't appear one single time in the movie , when I saw it first in the cinema I even fell asleep . Why was Margot Verger , a very important character , totally omitted ? Why was Barney shown as a dumb ignorant whose only ambition is to earn money ? And most of all , why was the psychological process Starling went through in the end , caused by the drugs Lecter applied to her , descended ? Not to speak about the fact that the ending was omitted , too , and totally changed ? Well , the reasons why Jodie Foster refused to play Starling again are well known and I accepted it , although like surely many others I 'm very disappointed 'cause I identified Starling with her . For stories like Red Dragon , The silence of the lambs or Hannibal that possess such psychological depth , it is very important to identify with a character when they 're adapted for the screen , but as the Germans say , that 's "" snow of yesterday "" . Ridley Scott did some incredibly good movies but with this one he does n't live up to his name . Jonathan Demme had exactly the right feeling for the plot , the characters and their relationships towards each other in The silence of the lambs , he should have done Hannibal , too .

1949,0,"No matter what other people have said you ca n't review this movie without comparing it to the original , if it existed on it 's own it would be a 2 - 3 out of 5 film but it is a remake of a 4 - 5 out of 5 film and so has standards to live up to and we need to see if it reached those standards . If the film was a re - working or , as in Planet of the Apes , a re - imagining of the original you would be able to look at the film in it 's own right , only referencing the original . Imagine it this way , if someone took the model in the ' Mona Lisa ' , posed her in a different way , and painted her you could only compare the framing , concept etc to the original but if someone just repainted her in the position of the original you would have to compare it totally . That said this film does n't just fail to be as good as the original it fails spectacularly , like it or not the original was one of the best movies ever made , the shower scene will never be forgotten , the remake was meant to be a celebration of Hitchcock but ended up actually degrading him and his master work . The degrading aspects of this picture were Vince Vaughn and Anne Heche . It 's nothing to do with wether they acted better or not it 's that the relationship between Norman and Marion in the original was really quite innocent , Norman did n't really understand sex , he had hardly any contact with the outside world and when he meets beautiful Marion and watches her change you feel that he is partly doing it from fascination as he does n't really understand sex and his attraction to her , this makes Norman sympathetic and almost an anti - hero , you are on his side because he does n't fully understand the world and is constantly fighting with himself and his ' Mother ' . In the remake that whole dynamic is gone , I must admit to Janet Leigh not being my type but she is very attractive and you can see that , Anne Heche is really unattractive and so Norman finding ' her ' Marion attractive is unbelievable if you add that to Vince Vaughn 's Norman masturbating whilst looking at her and you get a Norman that is just waiting for a chance to jack off at any naked woman no matter what she looks like , who you feel absolutely no sympathy for , they further destroy Norman 's innocent nature by putting the porno mags in his room . It destroys a character that we have come to like and feel sorry for , it 's like re - making ' It 's a wonderful life ' and having the main character a pimp , totally degrading . The only other character that I had problems with was Rita Wilson as Caroline , Marion 's workmate . In the original when Pat Hitchcock says the line ' he must have noticed my wedding ring ' it elicits a response of laughter as she is absolutely kidding herself , when Rita says it it just seems plausible as there really is n't any other reason why any man would flirt with Anne Heche over her . I'll admit that I am very biased , the original ' Psycho ' is my favorite film of all time , had the film been a reworking , with a different angle , then you could have turned these characters on their heads and it would have been perfectly acceptable . Hitch famously thaught the film would be too gory in colour and made it in black and white to lessen it . This also made the film more atmospheric and frightening in it 's own way and it gave it a beauty that could never be captured in colour and it is a sad statement about how movies are de - sensetising the public that people have said how the shower scene was more frightening in colour . ( n.b before people think ' he ca n't spell ' remember I 'm from England and we spell it colour)A remake should be just that , re made , this is a forgery , a complete copy and a very bad one at that . I could go on comparing but there is no point , almost everything is superior in the original . The only one thing that is better is the performance of Viggo Mortensen as Sam Loomis , John Gavin was very flat in the original ( Hitch called him ' The Stiff ' behind his back ) and Mortensen gives a more believable if less likeable performance . William H. Macy and Julianne Moore are the only other actors that hold up to the originals . Overall a movie that should be labeled ' Expensive Embarrassing Failed Experiment . Only view if comparing to original or if original is unknown to you . But view original too ' The movie would have got a 3 out of 5 if it were original or a reworking but as it is 0.5 out of 5 ( for Macy , Moore and Mortensen )",915,0,0.0001342281879194766,0.0001342281879194766,0.0001342281879194766,0.0077234211629936544,0.0001342281879194766,0.0001342281879194766,0.0001342281879194766,0.09594048175382465,0.0001342281879194766,0.0001342281879194766,0.0001342281879194766,0.007684483346157809,0.0001342281879194766,0.0001342281879194766,0.0001342281879194766,0.0001342281879194766,0.023626394782695685,0.0001342281879194766,0.0001342281879194766,0.0001342281879194766,0.372676208445682,0.0001342281879194766,0.0001342281879194766,0.0001342281879194766,0.0001342281879194766,0.0001342281879194766,0.03608606436601422,0.0001342281879194766,0.0001342281879194766,0.0001342281879194766,0.0001342281879194766,0.0001342281879194766,0.0001342281879194766,0.0001342281879194766,0.0001342281879194766,0.03283112283704498,0.0001342281879194766,0.0001342281879194766,0.20236604218824406,0.0001342281879194766,0.0001342281879194766,0.007164897454455438,0.0001342281879194766,0.17005241026925513,0.038613574064772574,0.0001342281879194766,0.0001342281879194766,0.0001342281879194766,0.0001342281879194766,0.0001342281879194766,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0
1950,0,"I know curiosity killed the cat , but I simply had to see the remake of Psycho , especially after being on such a Hitchcok journey recently and knowing his work . I 've watched the original Psycho though since I was a kid , I knew how to respect it and not only that , it was an excellent movie ! One of the best , in fact ! The first thing I said when I heard about the remake was "" How do you remake perfection ? "" . I stuck to that as well , but I think I have a more open mind now and figured maybe it was a way of introducing Psycho to a new generation . But this turned into a total insult and slap to the face of the original Psycho . I know this has been said , but I watched the making of this film , and the director was like "" Oh , I just want to update it and shoot each scene shot by shot like the original "" ... what 's the friggin ' point ? ! OK , but I want to judge this movie on it 's own , despite it 's insulting blows the original . I mean , the acting was n't up to par , but honestly , it looked like the actors just watched the original and just memorized the lines from there and made it their crappy own . Watching the making of this film , I wanted to slap Anne Hasche , she said "" I 've never seen the original , I just wanted to work with Gus . "" Ooh , that made me angry , because frankly , it 's not just that , she really sucked in this role as Marian , she was n't convincing , not to mention her shower scene really was horrible . Vince Vaughn did n't make ... let 's just put it this way , the film was horribly miscasted . This was a sin against film and on it 's own , this was actually a bad movie . It was too much and destroyed what could 've been a new introduction for a new generation . But to Gus , leave the film making the one 's who KNOW WHAT THEY'RE DOING!1/10",395,0,0.00021978021978023146,0.00021978021978023146,0.00021978021978023146,0.009027414341889315,0.00021978021978023146,0.00021978021978023146,0.00021978021978023146,0.00021978021978023146,0.00021978021978023146,0.00021978021978023146,0.00021978021978023146,0.00021978021978023146,0.26911987855151165,0.00021978021978023146,0.00021978021978023146,0.00021978021978023146,0.00021978021978023146,0.00021978021978023146,0.00021978021978023146,0.00021978021978023146,0.19735493288086622,0.00021978021978023146,0.00021978021978023146,0.00021978021978023146,0.00021978021978023146,0.00021978021978023146,0.00021978021978023146,0.00021978021978023146,0.00021978021978023146,0.00021978021978023146,0.00021978021978023146,0.00021978021978023146,0.00021978021978023146,0.00021978021978023146,0.00021978021978023146,0.00021978021978023146,0.00021978021978023146,0.00021978021978023146,0.318381841450783,0.00021978021978023146,0.00021978021978023146,0.00021978021978023146,0.00021978021978023146,0.19622582288483928,0.00021978021978023146,0.00021978021978023146,0.00021978021978023146,0.00021978021978023146,0.00021978021978023146,0.00021978021978023146,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
2144,0,"Do n't get me wrong , I love the TV series of League Of Gentlemen . It was funny , twisted and completely inspired . I was looking forward to the movie , the premise was interesting and I looked forward to see what they had done with the characters and where the bizarre storyline would take them . It was a total disappointment , for starters the three weakest characters in the series were the leads and it only contained bit parts for the other characters ( why not pick mickey & Pauline , papa Lazaro or tubs and Edward for the main parts ! ? ) . It was unfunny throughout , half baked gags and poor slapstick humour . The real clincher was the plain ridiculous period drama / comedy ( and i will use the word comedy loosely ) . It distracted from the main storyline and felt awkward , not to mention painfully unfunny . The direction of the movie is appalling , and often feels that the lines were delivered by the characters within one take . Very rushed . Then - the three headed Plasticine - esquire monster . What the hell was all that about ? plain ridiculous , it felt like the League of gentlemen tagged it on at the end . All in all I found myself looking at my watch and sighing with disappointment throughout my experience of the film . What was once an amazing Television series has been tainted by a terribly unfunny film . If i could give it 0 out of 10 i would .

Fatally flawed , "" Mob Boss "" is so derivative that boredom quickly overcomes comedy and the film drags on with car chases , hidden weapons in a restaurant bathroom , and numerous other nonsense . - MERK",134,0,0.0013333333333334218,0.0013333333333334218,0.0013333333333334218,0.0013333333333334218,0.0013333333333334218,0.0013333333333334218,0.0013333333333334218,0.0013333333333334218,0.1039776839072403,0.0013333333333334218,0.0013333333333334218,0.0013333333333334218,0.0013333333333334218,0.0013333333333334218,0.0013333333333334218,0.0013333333333334218,0.0013333333333334218,0.0013333333333334218,0.0013333333333334218,0.06812958234119582,0.33545335361569556,0.3382435011795081,0.0013333333333334218,0.0013333333333334218,0.0013333333333334218,0.0013333333333334218,0.0013333333333334218,0.0013333333333334218,0.0013333333333334218,0.0013333333333334218,0.0013333333333334218,0.0013333333333334218,0.0013333333333334218,0.0013333333333334218,0.0013333333333334218,0.0013333333333334218,0.0013333333333334218,0.0013333333333334218,0.0013333333333334218,0.0013333333333334218,0.0013333333333334218,0.0013333333333334218,0.0013333333333334218,0.09419587895635638,0.0013333333333334218,0.0013333333333334218,0.0013333333333334218,0.0013333333333334218,0.0013333333333334218,0.0013333333333334218,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
2797,0,"The movie is powerful as a political statement about extraordinary rendition , torture and the politics of the war on terror . Others have already commented on these and other aspects of the movie . My review may contain spoilers , so if you have n't seen the movie , you may not want to read beyond this point . Several questions are raised by this movie . First of all , was the protagonist guilty or not ? There is no satisfying explanation for why the NSA decided to have him picked up and rendered in the first place . Is there an innocent explanation for why he got phone calls from what the NSA thinks is a terrorist ? If there is , the movie does not seem to give one and that made the whole movie quite unsatisfying to me . It is all well and good to make statements about whether torture is right or wrong , but first prove to me that they tortured the wrong person , then we will take it to the next step . If the protagonist was guilty , then what was achieved by releasing him ? Perhaps , we was well - trained to resist up to a certain point and then pretend to break down and give answers that can be proved wrong with a little research , thus tending to lead the torturers to believe that they had tortured an innocent man into confessing without actually being guilty . However , there is nothing in the movie that proves he is guilty either . The various other loose ends out there are : 1 . So , a rogue CIA agent has him released and flown back home . What prevents the NSA from picking him up again ? A little publicity in the Washington Post ? Please give me a break here ... If a senator is not willing to put his neck on the line to intervene on his behalf , what does Corinne Whitman have to fear ? 2 . If the NSA has been tracking what phone numbers are being called by whom , why could n't they listen in on some of the calls to figure out whether anything underhanded is being discussed ? 3 . The plot is even more stupid anyways . Any criminal with more than a dozen brain cells would transact his criminal business on an anonymous prepaid cell phone line , not on one that can be traced back to him and his house . The whole movie revolves around tugging at the viewers ' heart strings by showing graphic and gratuitous scenes of torture . But when you think about it with any more depth , there is nothing of substance in this movie , only plenty of unanswered questions and the feeling of "" what , that is it ? ! ! ! "" at the end of the movie .",496,0,0.0003846153846154056,0.0003846153846154056,0.0003846153846154056,0.0003846153846154056,0.0003846153846154056,0.0003846153846154056,0.0003846153846154056,0.0003846153846154056,0.0003846153846154056,0.0003846153846154056,0.0003846153846154056,0.0003846153846154056,0.0003846153846154056,0.0003846153846154056,0.0003846153846154056,0.0003846153846154056,0.0003846153846154056,0.0003846153846154056,0.0003846153846154056,0.025676400129495448,0.4703664801710834,0.0003846153846154056,0.0003846153846154056,0.0003846153846154056,0.0003846153846154056,0.0003846153846154056,0.1742736728823876,0.0003846153846154056,0.0003846153846154056,0.0003846153846154056,0.0003846153846154056,0.023053883048227072,0.0003846153846154056,0.0003846153846154056,0.023247318454751725,0.0003846153846154056,0.02434990913704227,0.0003846153846154056,0.0003846153846154056,0.0003846153846154056,0.0003846153846154056,0.0003846153846154056,0.0003846153846154056,0.0003846153846154056,0.24249387463855007,0.0003846153846154056,0.0003846153846154056,0.0003846153846154056,0.0003846153846154056,0.0003846153846154056,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0
3332,0,"I liked most of this film . As other reviews mentioned it has a good cast , the plot is interesting enough . All in all it is fun to watch . But the ending , I feel , is completely botched , it left me bewildered . Yes , you expect people crossing and double - crossing each other in this sort of movie , but quadruple - crossing ? Well , if it 's justified by the plot then why not ? But that 's the bad part , there 's completely no need for it . After a certain point it 's all scheming with completely no meaning . ( here comes the SPOILER ) . After the airport scene Enrico and his accomplices already HAVE the money . I could n't understand the need for the rest of the scam . Is it all necessary just to rub Federico 's nose in the fact that he 's been fooled ? I do n't buy it .

3665,0,"simply i just watched this movie just because of Sarah & am also giving these 4 stars just because of her , on the other side This movie was easily one of the worst movies I have ever seen . Theacting was horrible . The script was uninspired . This was a movie that kept contradicting itself . The film was sloppy and unoriginal . its not like I was expecting a good film . Just something to give me a jump or two . This did not even do that.he worst thing is that , the more I think about the overall plot , the less sense it actually makes and the more holes we keep finding . A real shame really , as I 'm fairly sure that there was a good idea lurking in there somewhere ... I'm perhaps being a bit harsh giving the film a 4/10 but given the actors involved and again SARA obvious writing talent , this film really should have delivered far more . This movie is just crap , I ca nt put it differently . Since the very beginning one knows is going to be crap . The story , dialogue , acting , special effects , make - up , pretty much EVERYTHING sucks . I like vampire movies and I know they will never be Oscar winning movies but this one is not even worth seeing , I ca n't believe how somebody produced this thing . It 's not even about vampires , it 's more about a dream / reality experience . The development of the movie is incoherent , the motivation of the characters is ... Does n't exist , everything seems like a big joke . Maybe that 's what they tried to do , but I sincerely doubt it . I wish I knew what they tried to pull but it just backfired , it 's definitely one of the worst movies I 've ever seen in my life ( and I 've seen many bad movies , but nothing compared to this ) Please , make yourselves a favor and do NOT watch this . P.S. It 's also full of clichés ! P.S. 2 Bad Script , Bad directing , Bad cinematography . P.S. 3 I bothered commenting on this as a favor to everyone .",395,0,0.00021276595744682133,0.00021276595744682133,0.00021276595744682133,0.040719746306278296,0.00021276595744682133,0.013139820115547964,0.022602596090192266,0.00021276595744682133,0.00021276595744682133,0.00021276595744682133,0.00021276595744682133,0.00021276595744682133,0.1969061251746591,0.00021276595744682133,0.00021276595744682133,0.00021276595744682133,0.00021276595744682133,0.00021276595744682133,0.00021276595744682133,0.00021276595744682133,0.4550424292496166,0.15946949322802614,0.00021276595744682133,0.00021276595744682133,0.00021276595744682133,0.00021276595744682133,0.00021276595744682133,0.00021276595744682133,0.00021276595744682133,0.00021276595744682133,0.00021276595744682133,0.00021276595744682133,0.030698675580878736,0.00021276595744682133,0.00021276595744682133,0.00021276595744682133,0.00021276595744682133,0.00021276595744682133,0.00021276595744682133,0.00021276595744682133,0.00021276595744682133,0.00021276595744682133,0.00021276595744682133,0.07248494404203441,0.00021276595744682133,0.00021276595744682133,0.00021276595744682133,0.00021276595744682133,0.00021276595744682133,0.00021276595744682133,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
3963,0,""" ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ "" ! If IMDb would allow one - word reviews , that 's what mine would be . This film was originally intended only for kids and it would seem to be very tough going for adults or older kids to watch the film . The singing , the story , everything is dull and washed out -- just like this public domain print . Like other comedy team films with roots in traditional kids stories ( such as the awful SNOW WHITE AND THE THREE STOOGES and the overrated BABES IN TOYLAND ) , this movie has limited appeal and just does n't age well . Now that I think about it , I seriously doubt that many kids nowadays would even find this film enjoyable ! So my advice is DON'T watch this film .

4010,0,""" The Best Movie of the 90 's "" "" The Welsh Trainspotting"" .... Aye , right ! I went into this movie with pretty high expectations , and it was all downhill from there . This movie was supposed to be this archetypal movie on the drug culture of the early 90 's , and was going to allow us all to see inside this scene , and shatter the media 's preconceptions following the moral panic which followed the death of Leah Betts in 1995 . Unfortunately it has fallen a long way short . Where Trainspotting was able to treat you like an adult on the subject , and potential problems that surround drugs , this just provided us with some schmaltzy tale of the wonder of drugs , and how it can like , you know , like totally open your mind . Cue some guff about Bill Hicks , and Howard Marks ad nausea . It is painfully bad at times . I mean , the scene at the end between Lulu and her Auntie actually made me laugh out loud . Now maybe I am just a cynic , but the way Jip leads us through this tale is like listening to THAT Acid frazzled guy you once met at a house party , who talks to you about how "" the man "" is holding us back , and how Acid has released him from the strains of modern society . You just wanna shake some sense into him , and ask him to leave the premises . The script was a real problem for me , because where Trainspotting had Irvine Welsh 's excellent book to cite from , this is written and directed by Justin Kerrigan . The words "" Jack of all trades , master of none "" come to mind . You can see where his inspiration comes from , particularly in the style of narration from main character Jip ( which sets the main character in a social situation where he speaks directly to the camera , and outlines what is going through his mind as the scenario plays out ) The problem with this is that some of the speeches to camera are just painful to watch . Mainly this comes down to a lack of empathy for Jip , but they are so desperate to sound philosophical that they just end up sounding like your average A - Level drama project . The direction is fine , and the intentions are good , but it is so lacking in any integrity that you start to wonder what the hype is about . Saying that though , it is not all bad . There are moments which are genuinely very amusing , and entertaining . Moff is the highlight of the movie for me . For an independent movie it also managed to attract a high numbers of quality British actors / actresses , which maybe outlines why there was such a buzz about the movie . Best movie of the 90 's ? Not by a long shot , but if you 're looking for a solid Sunday night movie , then this might just be your bag . Inevitably though , the movie is flawed by the hype that surrounds it .",557,0,0.23150746044396525,0.00019801980198021668,0.017225605931600406,0.00019801980198021668,0.00019801980198021668,0.00019801980198021668,0.00019801980198021668,0.00019801980198021668,0.00019801980198021668,0.00019801980198021668,0.00019801980198021668,0.00019801980198021668,0.00019801980198021668,0.00019801980198021668,0.00019801980198021668,0.00019801980198021668,0.00019801980198021668,0.00019801980198021668,0.00019801980198021668,0.01443718495701928,0.540784224365763,0.00019801980198021668,0.02376156893495011,0.00019801980198021668,0.00019801980198021668,0.026753817189067566,0.00019801980198021668,0.00019801980198021668,0.010471448790612726,0.00019801980198021668,0.00019801980198021668,0.00019801980198021668,0.00019801980198021668,0.00019801980198021668,0.00019801980198021668,0.00019801980198021668,0.020749803092154514,0.00019801980198021668,0.02942576594551082,0.00019801980198021668,0.00019801980198021668,0.00019801980198021668,0.00019801980198021668,0.0769623282701478,0.00019801980198021668,0.00019801980198021668,0.00019801980198021668,0.00019801980198021668,0.00019801980198021668,0.00019801980198021668,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
4034,0,"This film almost gave me a nervous breakdown . When I was recovering from appendicitis a few years ago , I had just started teaching in secondary ( high ) school . The whole teaching business was all a bit nervewracking for a beginner , but to mentally prepare myself for going back into the classroom I decided to watch some rather awful films . The Flintstones was one of the films that I chose , and then I put "" King Of The Streets "" ( the UK title of ' Alien Warrior ' ) on . Just before it finished I found myself almost in tears at the sheer waste of it all ... my life , the film stock , the £ 2 I had paid for it a couple of weeks ago in the Blockbuster ex rental section , the time it must have taken to print the sleeve art , the effort of the editors and musicians involved in the soundtrack ( as negligable as their efforts were) ... the list goes on . I love bad films . Let me make this perfectly clear - I LOVE watching crappy films from Blockbusters . Me and my mate Dan used to sit and watch many , many cheapjack horrors and laugh at them . But this was a different type of crappy film . I do n't think that anything has come close to this , not even Tobe Hooper 's "" Death Trap "" ( which is probably my second worst film in the world ) . The whole making a car from abandoned parts section nearly killed me ; the repetition of music at any available opportunity , regardless of on - screen events ; the whole .... AAAGGGHHHHHHH ! ! ! ! ! I ca n't even carry on with this ' critical ' dissection , as my gag reflex has started . The futility of that film , even now , three years after I watched it for the first and last time , still renders me speechless ( but I am still able to type ) . The whole "" making a car from odd parts "" section had me contemplating horrible things . I implore you , if you are interested in watching this film , just gaze at the cover of the video and imagine the worst possible version of the story synopsis on the back . I can almost guarantee that it wo n't be even half as bad as this film actually is . Do n't , under any circumstances , contemplate actually watching it for any reason whatsoever . Not if you are a Christian and you want to see a Christ allegory ; not if you are a bad movie afictionado and you want to experience the true nadir of trash ; not even if you want your life to seem longer ( and believe me , every second that this film runs seems like at least a minute ) . Make no mistake about it , this film is unholy . It is the antichrist in video form .

4074,0,"There are good - bad movies and bad - bad - movies and enjoyably bad movies ... this is n't one of them . This is a movie that does n't realize just how bad it is . I saw this at a screening on November 14 , 2006 at the New Beverly Theater in Los Angeles as part of the "" Grindhouse Cinema "" this theater puts on every month . Hopefully presenters Eric Caiden & co. will think twice before letting writer / director Lawrenece Foldes anywhere near them again . What a con man . The guy got up to speak before the film -- you would think he was Orson Welles talking about "" Touch of Evil "" or some other lost classic . Hardly . Nice of him to take up 20 minutes of the audiences ' time with his incoherent rambling . "" Young Warriors "" has been described as a cross between "" Animal House "" and "" Death Wish "" but if you are expecting something along the lines of imitations like "" Revenge of the Nerds "" or "" The Exterminator "" you will be in for one sad disappointment . The script makes zero sense . The direction is so poor the actors looked embarrassed and what can you say when the best thing about the movie is watching a car blow up?Poor Richard "" shaft "" Roundtree . In this movie he plays another character with the first name of "" John "" but that 's about the only similarity his character here has to the aforementioned classic . I hope this film allowed him to pay the rent for another month . Other actors who look like they wished they could be anywhere else included Ernest Borgnine and Linda Day George . This is a complete waste of time . Even the audience did not seem that into it ( except for the one spazz - boy sitting in the back who yelled "" whoa "" every five minutes and his girlfriend who giggled with the fervor of a lobotomized talking Barbie every time he opened his mouth).For real films about vigilantes , I would suggest the following : Death Wish I , II , III , Exterminator I , Vigilante Force , Ms. 45 , Rolling Thunder , the No - Mercy Man ( the latter two being a pair of films presented at this theater a couple of years ago -- probably the same budget as "" Young Warriors "" but both were a million times better ! )",433,0,0.00024096385542170343,0.00024096385542170343,0.03527552790039531,0.00024096385542170343,0.00024096385542170343,0.00024096385542170343,0.00024096385542170343,0.0496647379561975,0.00024096385542170343,0.00024096385542170343,0.00024096385542170343,0.00024096385542170343,0.00024096385542170343,0.00024096385542170343,0.00024096385542170343,0.00024096385542170343,0.00024096385542170343,0.00024096385542170343,0.036383614923576155,0.025666123381630594,0.6303339067853726,0.00024096385542170343,0.00024096385542170343,0.00024096385542170343,0.00024096385542170343,0.00024096385542170343,0.00024096385542170343,0.00024096385542170343,0.00024096385542170343,0.00024096385542170343,0.00024096385542170343,0.00024096385542170343,0.00024096385542170343,0.00024096385542170343,0.00024096385542170343,0.00024096385542170343,0.00024096385542170343,0.00024096385542170343,0.00024096385542170343,0.018407408968211084,0.09741322692739596,0.00024096385542170343,0.00024096385542170343,0.0967349712295094,0.00024096385542170343,0.00024096385542170343,0.00024096385542170343,0.00024096385542170343,0.00024096385542170343,0.00024096385542170343,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
4171,0,"Wow . I felt like I needed to shower off after watching this one , but maybe there were other reasons that I will leave to your imagination . I felt used and abused after wacking , I mean watching this film . Hairy chests , thick mustaches , and well , hairy everything describes this porn / horror movie , but hey , it was 1981 , you ca n't call it "" porn "" in the 70s and 80s without the hair . As a horror flick , this bites . But as a piece of exploitation / porn from Italy 's rich cinematic history- it definitely has a place in my library . The copy I have is in Italian with English subtitles . I wish it had the really poorly dubbed English , I think it would have added to the sleaziness factor that already existed . The only white guy who gets laid in the movie is "" Mark Shannon""- he is the moustache wearing , hairy chested piece of machismo who really does try and give a performance every time he "" steps up to bat "" . This was at the end of an era where porn producers were actually trying to make something artistic . Nothing like panning the camera from a tropical backdrop to a hairy man having "" doggie - style "" sex with a woman . I ca n't help but laugh .

4636,0,"This movie would receive a much higher vote from me in general and I will talk about why , but first and foremost it receives four stars and should stay at four stars because of the directors ridiculously tasteless portrayal of rape and sexual assault . Not far into the movie Oyama sexually assaults a woman he rescued earlier , and while she briefly becomes somewhat miffed by his actions this attitude only lasts about five minutes before loving adoration sets in and carries her character through the rest of the film . I know many will argue that it 's not that important in a kung fu beat - em - up , and as a fan of the genera I ca n't say that it 's all that unusual , but that does n't stop it from being completely tasteless every time I see it . What I will say in this movie 's defence however is that it 's somewhat refreshing to see a martial arts , or even action movie of any sort , that offers no actual hero for the viewer to get behind . Oyama is portrayed as a rapist and murderer ; a societal outcast whose only student becomes completely mentally unbalanced before being gunned down by the police . The final shots of the movie leave one with the feeling that Oyama himself is poised for a major breakdown and no longer seems to care for the woman he earlier assaulted into loving him and has since followed him with puppy - dog like devotion . Whether this was truly the intended message of the movie or not , one ca n't help but feel a little hopeful that Oyama might be on the brink of suicide by the time the movie is over . This is a rare emotional treatment from the martial arts genre and its interesting to see a film that leaves you with a sense that its violence is not to be celebrated . If only Karate Bullfighter had treated the subject of sexual violence better , either by creating more emotional depth and recognition between the two characters involved , or by leaving it out all together , this would have been a much more interesting film .",381,0,0.13260696442833378,0.00039215686274513337,0.00039215686274513337,0.00039215686274513337,0.00039215686274513337,0.00039215686274513337,0.00039215686274513337,0.00039215686274513337,0.00039215686274513337,0.00039215686274513337,0.00039215686274513337,0.00039215686274513337,0.00039215686274513337,0.00039215686274513337,0.00039215686274513337,0.00039215686274513337,0.00039215686274513337,0.00039215686274513337,0.019990557369435957,0.00039215686274513337,0.39254717777850556,0.00039215686274513337,0.00039215686274513337,0.00039215686274513337,0.00039215686274513337,0.00039215686274513337,0.00039215686274513337,0.00039215686274513337,0.00039215686274513337,0.00039215686274513337,0.00039215686274513337,0.00039215686274513337,0.00039215686274513337,0.00039215686274513337,0.00039215686274513337,0.00039215686274513337,0.00039215686274513337,0.00039215686274513337,0.00039215686274513337,0.00039215686274513337,0.00039215686274513337,0.00039215686274513337,0.00039215686274513337,0.4368160847374485,0.00039215686274513337,0.00039215686274513337,0.00039215686274513337,0.00039215686274513337,0.00039215686274513337,0.00039215686274513337,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
4714,0,"This movie is about a depressed and emotionally constricted man has a distant relative move in with him in his apartment in Istanbul . As time passes , their relationship becomes more and more strained until finally he begins yelling at his house guest -- who is out of work and does n't appear all that eager to find work . That 's most of the movie in fact . The problem is that although emotionally constricted and depressed people are VERY withdrawn and non - communicative , they do n't make for a very satisfying movie . That 's because most of the time he ( and his roomie ) just stare into space and say nothing . I think all these flat moments could have been shortened to make a 30 minute movie -- I certainly would n't have minded .",143,0,0.0007692307692308243,0.0007692307692308243,0.0007692307692308243,0.0007692307692308243,0.04222831856131306,0.0007692307692308243,0.0007692307692308243,0.16745172040999326,0.0007692307692308243,0.0007692307692308243,0.0007692307692308243,0.0007692307692308243,0.21117650225457862,0.0007692307692308243,0.0007692307692308243,0.0007692307692308243,0.0007692307692308243,0.0007692307692308243,0.039215698072116084,0.040357194827522674,0.3490512008994592,0.0007692307692308243,0.05447765324595592,0.0007692307692308243,0.0007692307692308243,0.0007692307692308243,0.0007692307692308243,0.0007692307692308243,0.0007692307692308243,0.0007692307692308243,0.0007692307692308243,0.0007692307692308243,0.0007692307692308243,0.0007692307692308243,0.0007692307692308243,0.0007692307692308243,0.0007692307692308243,0.0007692307692308243,0.0007692307692308243,0.0007692307692308243,0.0007692307692308243,0.0007692307692308243,0.0007692307692308243,0.0007692307692308243,0.06373401942136658,0.0007692307692308243,0.0007692307692308243,0.0007692307692308243,0.0007692307692308243,0.0007692307692308243,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

I 'll admit idea is interesting and could be turned into a good movie but this is not it . First of all choosing real life person , countess Bathory , is stupid move that adds absolutely nothing to the story . Anybody even vaguely familiar with her story would begin to wonder why and how did this Hungarian noblewoman end up in this movie . Choosing a generic vengeful spirit would be much , much better . Then there is whole you - die - in - real - life - as - you - die - in - the - game concept . As I said before interesting , Ring - like story . But instead of developing it into good story line it sort of just flows along with no explanation given why did this game became such as it is , why it was created and so on . Waste of good idea . And finally this movie does n't even have gory of funny parts that can if not save at least make crappy horror movies watchable . Death scenes are too quick and acting is too wooden to be funny .

I am a lifelong fan of Gone With the Wind and I could not have been more repulsed by the movie . I did compare "" Scarlett "" to the original GWTW because any film worth following GWTW needed to be on the same quality level as the first . Rhett was cast beautifully , although NO ONE will ever compare to Mr. Gable . I am also a strict Vivien Leigh fan ! ! She WAS Scarlett . She fit the bill . Not another actress in this lifetime or another will ever fit the same shoes but with "" Scarlett "" the job could have been done better . Not enough thought went into finding the proper Scarlett , that was evident . Overall , something to look to but if you want to know the what happened to Scarlett and Rhett , I suggest writing it yourself or finding fan fiction .

6104,0,"It really amazed me to see that someone would take so much time to assess such a bad movie . The beginning ( of the film ) had some truth in it . The Partisan "" AF "" was started in 1943 when two communist pilots from the Croat Ustashi AF deserted , together with their observers , in Breguet 19 and Potez 33 , respectively . The aircraft saw some action in strafing and hand - bombing , but did n't last very long . One crew was killed and the other survived , the pilot being killed later while flying a Spitfire Vc . The real Partisan squadrons were established when RAF detached two of its ( Yugoslav ) squadrons of Spitfire Vc and , Hurricane IIc , respectively , manned by Ex Yugoslav Royal Airforce pilots , and allotted them to Tito 's forces on the Island of Vis . Even those were never engaged in air - to - air activities , but strictly for ground support . So the film was one giant cow manure , to put it mildly , and the lowest point for its , otherwise not at all bad , director . By some quirk of fate I was present on the filming of the last sequence of the movie , when dozens of German aircraft were destroyed ( Yugoslav 522 trainers , used also in the flying sequences ) on the Mostar military airport . The pyrotechnics were impressive , and the Scotch served lavishly by the film crew was even better . Otherwise , the film was a shameless lie was and frequently joked about by the contemporary audience .",281,0,0.0007407407407408006,0.0007407407407408006,0.0007407407407408006,0.0007407407407408006,0.0007407407407408006,0.0007407407407408006,0.0007407407407408006,0.0007407407407408006,0.0007407407407408006,0.0007407407407408006,0.0007407407407408006,0.0007407407407408006,0.0007407407407408006,0.0007407407407408006,0.0007407407407408006,0.0007407407407408006,0.0768517357693563,0.0007407407407408006,0.0007407407407408006,0.0007407407407408006,0.0007407407407408006,0.27553076981454405,0.037777777777774676,0.0007407407407408006,0.0007407407407408006,0.0007407407407408006,0.041969580753846034,0.0007407407407408006,0.0007407407407408006,0.0007407407407408006,0.0007407407407408006,0.0007407407407408006,0.0007407407407408006,0.0007407407407408006,0.0007407407407408006,0.0007407407407408006,0.0007407407407408006,0.0007407407407408006,0.0007407407407408006,0.0007407407407408006,0.0007407407407408006,0.0007407407407408006,0.0007407407407408006,0.42312548674540684,0.07097813116996,0.0007407407407408006,0.04191466611725772,0.0007407407407408006,0.0007407407407408006,0.0007407407407408006,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0

6818,0,"I purchased this one for a couple of dollars at the local video store , as they cleared out their tapes in favour of DVDs . I doubt they 'll be replacing this one , somehow . I could n't say that it 's one of the worst movies I 've ever seen , but it 's very dull . No real cannibal scenes . Me Me Lai is not naked enough of the time ( only about 4 or 5 times ) . And she 's not the Thai goddess that I expected , either . So two of my reasons for watching this movie were knocked out . There is some severe animal violence here for those that enjoy that sort of thing . A great fight between a mongoose and a large snake gets quite bloody .

6823,0,"Looking and sounding like a cheap porno without the sex , this is the first in an impressive string of stinkers from producer ( or in this case director ) Geoffrey Reeve . And it 's a doozy . Laughable on just about every level . Some government agents ( I think ) are "" professionally murdered "" in Amsterdam and a considerably less - than - charismatic , block - of - wood Interpol agent ( who I assure you is not named Louis Salinger ) is sent in to investigate by walking around a lot to ensure the tax - dodge financiers get their money 's worth for the plane tickets to shoot on location . The wannabe - hard - hitting attitudes to drugs and depiction of prostitution must have looked laughably outdated even before the celluloid dried , but the script at least is very obliging in that it explains exactly what 's happening regularly in horribly contrived direlogue ( "" Were you followed ? Oh no of course not . No one outside Washington even knows you 're here ! "" ) yet despite this the plot somehow remains confusing . By the time a sinister Vladimir Putin lookalike Priest ( no less than Kronsteen from From Russia with Love ) swaggers up to his pulpit to deliver a sermon your brain will have switched off , which is unfortunate because you 'll miss our hero - pinned to the ground during a fight - struggling to reach for a plank of wood only to later realise he is in fact sitting on a loaded pistol , and him shouting "" You bastaaaard ! "" at his friend 's murdered corpse , and the leather - bound , moustachioed go - go boys , the morris dancing and the hilarious torture sequence - all of which provide ample laughs . Only the climactic boat chase impresses . It 's an exciting , well - directed sequence that really has no place in this movie . Such a glaring anomaly is explained when the credits roll - Reeve had nothing to do with that sequence ! Thankfully everything goes back to business as usual for the ridiculous , spit - out - your - drink twist and warehouse shootout . Unless such a wretched thing as a Geoffrey Reeve completist exists - and you 're one of them - I would n't bother with this instantly forgettable nonsense .",413,0,0.0005882352941177024,0.09661917573039051,0.0005882352941177024,0.0005882352941177024,0.0005882352941177024,0.0005882352941177024,0.0005882352941177024,0.0005882352941177024,0.0005882352941177024,0.0005882352941177024,0.0005882352941177024,0.0005882352941177024,0.0005882352941177024,0.0005882352941177024,0.0005882352941177024,0.0005882352941177024,0.0005882352941177024,0.0005882352941177024,0.0005882352941177024,0.0005882352941177024,0.6509424749299707,0.0005882352941177024,0.0005882352941177024,0.0005882352941177024,0.0005882352941177024,0.0005882352941177024,0.07000110567467639,0.0005882352941177024,0.0005882352941177024,0.0005882352941177024,0.0005882352941177024,0.0005882352941177024,0.047493074864361724,0.0005882352941177024,0.0005882352941177024,0.0005882352941177024,0.0005882352941177024,0.0005882352941177024,0.0005882352941177024,0.10847358056530394,0.0005882352941177024,0.0005882352941177024,0.0005882352941177024,0.0005882352941177024,0.0005882352941177024,0.0005882352941177024,0.0005882352941177024,0.0005882352941177024,0.0005882352941177024,0.0005882352941177024,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

7940,0,"I tried . Lord help me , how I tried . But there are just some people almost incapable of creating quality . Brett Ratner , Uwe Boll , Britney Spears , and Asylum . To their credit "" The 9/11 Commission Report "" seems like an honest attempt by the company to advance into a more sophisticated state of storytelling and movie making . But for all intents and purposes , it comes off as another truly film in their gallery . At the opening , the disclaimer notifies audiences that all the names have been changed , but the names of the terrorists remain relatively the same . A man named Mussaui attempts to learn how to fly a plane . With a stone cold grimace that would instantly make anyone uneasy , this "" undercover "" agent is able to learn how to fly on a small computer . And you have to wonder , not how he was able to get into this program so easily , but on how these people did n't even ask questions ; because this scene is so far - fetched in its presentation , and the actor playing this man is extremely over the top . And you can see that director Scott attempts to mimic Paul Greengrass with a bright grainy photography that 's followed by an awfully dizzying and irritating hand - held direction that , throughout the entire film , attempts to take off from Greengrass 's gung - ho guerrilla film - making techniques . You can sense Scott emulating Greengrass 's technique for realism , but it becomes rather lame - brained halfway in . Meanwhile the film comes off less a "" Traffic "" take off , and more a take off on "" Law & Order "" in which we 'll have the disclaimer notifying us the names have been changed , the logo almost reminiscent of the "" Law & Order "" logo , and then ninety minutes of the actors pumping their chests and discussing politics . Neither of which are ever as compelling as it tries to be . And then when the film seems as if its attempting to be an adult drama , Scott relies on his old failsafe , the sex scene . Scott 's new film looks like it really wants to be thought of as a low budget "" Munich "" but it 's not , and it manages to be underwhelming on every such occasion possible . "" The 9/11 Commission Report "" falls flat , and that 's because its limited in its attempts to imitate other films . While I appreciate the ambition inherent behind the camera , this new perspective of the events leading up to 9/11 is flat , and dull . Hard as it may try to be a low - budget "" Munich "" it 's only really as entertaining as a normal Dolph Lundgren film you 'd find on Cinemax .",504,0,0.00030303030303033117,0.10199911172450592,0.016497515539642467,0.00030303030303033117,0.00030303030303033117,0.00030303030303033117,0.015454545500371331,0.00030303030303033117,0.00030303030303033117,0.00030303030303033117,0.00030303030303033117,0.00030303030303033117,0.11528153384007614,0.00030303030303033117,0.00030303030303033117,0.00030303030303033117,0.00030303030303033117,0.00030303030303033117,0.01544700537693177,0.00030303030303033117,0.1663346751575789,0.00030303030303033117,0.00030303030303033117,0.00030303030303033117,0.00030303030303033117,0.00030303030303033117,0.00030303030303033117,0.00030303030303033117,0.00030303030303033117,0.00030303030303033117,0.00030303030303033117,0.00030303030303033117,0.05322848339212801,0.00030303030303033117,0.00030303030303033117,0.00030303030303033117,0.00030303030303033117,0.00030303030303033117,0.00030303030303033117,0.00030303030303033117,0.00030303030303033117,0.00030303030303033117,0.00030303030303033117,0.3804336163944017,0.00030303030303033117,0.12289927065012038,0.00030303030303033117,0.00030303030303033117,0.00030303030303033117,0.00030303030303033117,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0
7996,0,"Tom Selleck plays an absentee son to senile "" pop "" Don Ameche and weary mom Anne Jackson , making up for his indiscretions ( one presumes ) and taking them in after Ameche has burned down his mobile home ; meanwhile , Selleck 's job is vanquished by the F.B.I. , his assets are frozen , his wife and kids leave him and his obnoxious sister and her brats have come to stay . Brightly - painted comedy - of - ills is as out of touch with reality as Ameche 's doddering old coot . Perhaps a serious first draft ( with scenes such as Ameche walking out into traffic with two toddlers ) was incorporated into a sillier second or third version ( with Selleck getting poked , bumped , prodded , and eventually losing a toe and a testicle ! ) . Either way , it 's a painful experience , and Selleck 's sudden dedication to his father makes little sense ; he hobbles around and howls in pain , but retains his heart of mush .

8095,0,"Reeves plays Haji Murad , a hero in 1850 's Russia . This is a badly dubbed movie , with June Foray doing some of the voices . Unfortunately who ever was suppose to sync the voices to the lips was blind since the words never match the lip flaps . Anyone who says that Japanese films are bad have never watched this film . The film 's plot is instantly forgettable and so I 've forgotten it in the time its taken the movie to end and for me to sit and write this down . Perhaps it has more to do with the fact that the film is one of the many that Reeves made in hopes of moving away from action to more plot driven sort of films . It may have been a good thing for Reeves , but its deadly for the audience who have to slug through nooze fests such as this , where its all court intrigue with very little action . In Reeves defense , he was a good actor , he just had no real luck in picking films that were any good . They all looked great , but very few of them did n't put the those watching them into a coma for the film 's running time . This film will put you in a coma .

8198,0,"This is the second adaptation of Charlotte Armstrong by Claude Chabrol for the screen : the first was "" la rupture "" ( 1970)(from novel "" the balloon man "" ) and it 's really a pity no one cares about it . It 's Chabrol 's sleeper , and I urge any of his fans to see it . ""The chocolate "" cobweb was not that strong a detective story to begin with . I read it 20 years ago and forgot all about it . The movie promises some good things at first , though , then finally disappoints to a fault . This is a confusing Chabrol movie , mixing elements of the heyday ( circa 1969),and a lotta tongue - in - chick stuff coming from the eighties , the likes of ' poulet au vinaigre"",not one particularly memorable work . Part of the disappointment comes from the cast : this is a distressingly poor gathering : Jacques Dutronc plays like a zombie , Isabelle Huppert reveals herself a somewhat limited actress , finally rather vulgar .It worked in "" une affaire de femme"",it does not here . They are not supported by the young couple : both are bland and unremarkable . Actors from the past , say , Stephane Audran or Michel Bouquet(both in "" la rupture "" ) were brilliant and contributed to Chabrol 's then unique atmosphere . The story itself is undistinguished : beginning as some kind of "" serious "" "" la vie est un long fleuve tranquille "" ( besides , a character hints at Etienne Chatilliez 's very funny movie),the movie drags on and on as a laughable psychological drama afterwards . We will not congratulate the young female pianist , who , after all she learned about her wicked hostess , agrees to drive a car along a dangerous road . Because he makes too many movies , Chabrol frequently releases turkeys . One wonder why people who wants to watch one of his movies should choose this one among all his stuff up for grabs .

Katrina Kaif and Govinda pair looked awful . ( He 's 49 and she 's just 24 ... more than double of her age ) 3 . Salman 's comedy is less of acting and more of overacting.4 . Songs are good but interrupts the pace of the movie.5 . Some scenes were deliberately attempted by the movie makers to be funny , and 6 . Poor and flawed story . However , there are few pluses- 1 .

8520,0,"This quirky and watchable film is the story of a deluded dentist who starts out on his mission or crusade to fight tooth decay in the back and beyonds of Patagonia . Hailing from Northern Ireland , via New Jersey , the main character , Fergus , sees his crusade as a mission of mass importance and approaches it with all the enthusiasm , vitality , discipline and attention to detail one would expect from a trained dentist . Which adds to the hilarity , as his grand plans unravel and gradually fall to pieces as he goes from disaster to debacle in the Patagonian outback on the back of a customised motor bike or his , er , mobile dental unit . We never get to meet his wife , nor the rich philanthropist who is sponsoring the ill - fated mission , but , we do get a solid display from Lewis . Fans of his work will not be disappointed with his very believable performance as the deluded dentist who is gallantly adored by the , innocent but sexy , 18 year old female lead who tags along on for the * ahem * ride . This film is not for everyone and I can understand why it was n't pushed by the suits . It 's a low budget , sometimes charming , always disarming , mildly amusing and instantly forgettable film that sets out with low expectations and almost succeeds .",246,0,0.0009523809523810193,0.05104846571636491,0.0009523809523810193,0.0009523809523810193,0.0009523809523810193,0.0009523809523810193,0.0009523809523810193,0.0009523809523810193,0.0009523809523810193,0.0009523809523810193,0.0009523809523810193,0.0009523809523810193,0.0009523809523810193,0.0009523809523810193,0.0009523809523810193,0.0009523809523810193,0.0009523809523810193,0.0009523809523810193,0.0009523809523810193,0.0009523809523810193,0.0009523809523810193,0.0009523809523810193,0.1196424499400095,0.12621378712765566,0.0009523809523810193,0.0009523809523810193,0.0009523809523810193,0.0009523809523810193,0.0009523809523810193,0.0009523809523810193,0.0009523809523810193,0.0009523809523810193,0.1454739397804491,0.0009523809523810193,0.10111127315754084,0.0009523809523810193,0.0009523809523810193,0.0009523809523810193,0.0009523809523810193,0.0009523809523810193,0.0009523809523810193,0.0009523809523810193,0.0488658735393015,0.3666918297862946,0.0009523809523810193,0.0009523809523810193,0.0009523809523810193,0.0009523809523810193,0.0009523809523810193,0.0009523809523810193,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1

What I really thought was bad was at the beginning where Kirk and McCoy were teaching Spock how to sing "" Row , Row , Row Your Boat!""Do I have something against William Shatner ? I do not . But when it comes to being a director , he sucks ! This film is not one of the worst movies I have ever seen . But it is the worst of the Star Trek series ! I noticed that after this Shatner did not return to direct another film in the series . They apparently did not want him to direct another film again after this happened ! Overall , this movie sucks ! 2/10",180,0,0.0004761904761904987,0.0004761904761904987,0.0004761904761904987,0.08200280065902865,0.0004761904761904987,0.0004761904761904987,0.0004761904761904987,0.0004761904761904987,0.0004761904761904987,0.0004761904761904987,0.0004761904761904987,0.0004761904761904987,0.0004761904761904987,0.0004761904761904987,0.0004761904761904987,0.0004761904761904987,0.0004761904761904987,0.0004761904761904987,0.0004761904761904987,0.0004761904761904987,0.42389199418725926,0.18714865777691603,0.0004761904761904987,0.06557699306334415,0.0004761904761904987,0.0004761904761904987,0.06347583094620668,0.0004761904761904987,0.0004761904761904987,0.0004761904761904987,0.0004761904761904987,0.0004761904761904987,0.0004761904761904987,0.0004761904761904987,0.0004761904761904987,0.0004761904761904987,0.0004761904761904987,0.0004761904761904987,0.0004761904761904987,0.0004761904761904987,0.0004761904761904987,0.0004761904761904987,0.0004761904761904987,0.15695134241486314,0.0004761904761904987,0.0004761904761904987,0.0004761904761904987,0.0004761904761904987,0.0004761904761904987,0.0004761904761904987,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
8911,0,"I caught a screening of this at the True / False Documentary film festival in Columbia , Missouri , and I was pretty disappointed . I was expecting a cool documentary into the protest and activism surrounding the RNC , but what I got was a largely flawed , bad - acted , fictitious , conspiracy ridden badly woven tale . I 'd heard of its neo - documentary technique , "" blending both True and False "" but I expected more along the lines of a fictitious storyline developed for a better personification and to create a sense of unity between real interviews , but it was more along the lines of a terrible made - for - conspiracy theory TV movie . The acting overall is terrible except for Rossario , which is not surprising considering the Director at the screening said most of the lead characters had no acting training , his excuse being that he wanted them to be real . Heres a hint , real people ca n't act , but actors can usually act real . It would of been not so cornily offensive if it was n't blatantly obvious about how keen he was to push this extremely radical conspiracy theory onto us throughout the whole movie , its especially hysterical when we get a scene where the director cameos and starts ranting on about ridiculously stupid theories and secret agendas . The movie also does a good job of laughably stereotyping every single role , it tries so hard to romanticize these street activists and stamp a big ' Good ' or ' Evil ' on every character . Skip it , maybe find yourself a nice real documentary/",287,0,0.0003703703703704048,0.0003703703703704048,0.0003703703703704048,0.0003703703703704048,0.0003703703703704048,0.0003703703703704048,0.01888888888888833,0.0003703703703704048,0.0003703703703704048,0.0003703703703704048,0.0003703703703704048,0.0003703703703704048,0.0003703703703704048,0.0003703703703704048,0.0003703703703704048,0.0003703703703704048,0.05674418018958472,0.0003703703703704048,0.0003703703703704048,0.0003703703703704048,0.6222717892341364,0.13003827031142726,0.0003703703703704048,0.0003703703703704048,0.0003703703703704048,0.0003703703703704048,0.0003703703703704048,0.0003703703703704048,0.0003703703703704048,0.027710363514455,0.0003703703703704048,0.0003703703703704048,0.0003703703703704048,0.0003703703703704048,0.0003703703703704048,0.0003703703703704048,0.0003703703703704048,0.0003703703703704048,0.0003703703703704048,0.0003703703703704048,0.0003703703703704048,0.0003703703703704048,0.0003703703703704048,0.12805021156521024,0.0003703703703704048,0.0003703703703704048,0.0003703703703704048,0.0003703703703704048,0.0003703703703704048,0.0003703703703704048,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

Many secrets were never uncovered , the horse never found , the main conspirators never captured etc . However , this film seems to be distracted by character study , and very little attention payed to the plot . Some other questions are raised though , like why on earth would Mickey Rourke be in this film ? Its good to see rourkes career has taken off again , but he must cringe at the mention of this rubbish .

Her only two competitors in this category are John Leguziamo in "" The Pest "" and Julia Stiles in anything she 's done ( or half - done ) . Maybe she performed exactly as the script suggested or maybe ( groan ! ) that is the limit she has to her acting range . Either way , they should have had a rewrite and killed her off in the first 30 seconds of the film ( eg . Like the girl that fell off the balcony in Lethal Weapon ( I ) ( but at least she had nice breasts))Most Humbly Submitted ...

9409,0,"The original Road House was a classic cheesy 80s movie , which although it did n't have anywhere near award worthy writing or acting , was a very enjoyable and popular film , largely due to the presence of star Patrick Swayze and the great supporting cast , along with some excellent fight scenes and eye candy.16 years later , and MGM / Sony attempts to re - create the magic which left us all quoting one liners and reciting the three rules of bouncing ... with a movie which quotes all the original 's best one liners and recites the three rules . Were this an amateur fan made film , it would be seen as a loving homage to one of the most popular of Swayze 's movies . As a professionally made film , it falls flat on it 's face right into the DVD Bargin Bin , with its continual reuse of lines and plot from the original movie becoming more of an annoying sign of lack of originality rather than cool references to the original . Having said that , with new lines such as "" I 'm gon na kill you just like I killed your father "" no wonder the screenwriters decided to rehash much of the original script . I knew this was never going to be anything special , being a Straight to DVD Sequel , but I had at least hoped that there might be a couple of new ideas and fresh things included to live up to the Road House name , but what you get is simply just a 2006 remake of the same film , with a little narcotics added in . Were I the director , I 'd have removed all references to the first film so as not to tarnish the original and it 's characters . As it is , we got Patrick Swayze 's character now supposed to be dead ( killed off screen in a lame way by Jake Busey ) and his brother and son now the main characters , who strangely enough have completely different surnames . My favourite part was that Dalton 's ' son ' drove the same car his father did , a genuinely cool homage , although it was later ruined by having the car meet its end EXACTLY the same way as its predecessor did . That 's a good example of how this film goes too far in including sequences and ideas from the ' 89 movie . Also of course who can forget the legendary moment where Wild Bill promises to kill Shane "" just like I killed your father "" and then proceeds to attempt to dispatch him in a completely different manner . Amazing writing there . I see Schaech is listed as co - screenwriter . Stick to acting , or preferably , nothing . Overall though , this is an OK film if there 's nothing else to watch and you want to turn your brain off for an hour and a half , or if you have n't seen the first Road House , but hardcore fans of Swayze 's classic will be totally disappointed almost to the point of feeling insulting at how much of a rip off this movie is of the first . As someone once suggested as an alternative subtitle for this film , "" Even Jeff Healy is glad he wo n't be seeing this one ! "" Stick to the original Road House and relive the good old Swayze days !",599,0,0.00015873015873017198,0.00015873015873017198,0.00015873015873017198,0.00015873015873017198,0.00015873015873017198,0.00015873015873017198,0.03353583474797908,0.00015873015873017198,0.00015873015873017198,0.00015873015873017198,0.00015873015873017198,0.00015873015873017198,0.00015873015873017198,0.00015873015873017198,0.008070126392288745,0.00015873015873017198,0.00015873015873017198,0.023094403357071656,0.00015873015873017198,0.07031123434207617,0.28301770380139807,0.00015873015873017198,0.00015873015873017198,0.021816095986864632,0.00015873015873017198,0.00015873015873017198,0.0582798698459181,0.00015873015873017198,0.00015873015873017198,0.00015873015873017198,0.00015873015873017198,0.00015873015873017198,0.00015873015873017198,0.00015873015873017198,0.00015873015873017198,0.00015873015873017198,0.00015873015873017198,0.00015873015873017198,0.09883205282518072,0.00015873015873017198,0.023895736624569338,0.043970929389427794,0.00015873015873017198,0.25555093601684764,0.07359333063863156,0.00015873015873017198,0.00015873015873017198,0.00015873015873017198,0.00015873015873017198,0.00015873015873017198,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0
9443,0,"I bought this film at Blockbuster for $ 3.00 , because it sounded interesting ( a bit Ranma - esque , with the idea of someone dragging around a skeleton ) , because there was a cute girl in a mini - skirt on the back , and because there was a Restricted Viewing sticker on it . I thought it was going to be a sweet or at least sincere coming of age story with a weird indie edge . I was 100 % wrong . Having watched it , I have to wonder how it got the restricted sticker , since there is hardly any foul language , little violence , and the closest thing to nudity ( Honestly ! I do n't usually go around hoping for it ! ) is when the girl is in her nightgown and you see her panties ( you see her panties a lot in this movie , because no matter what , she 's wearing a miniskirt of some sort ) . Even the anti - religious humor is tame ( and lame , caricatured , insincere , derivative , unoriginal , and worst of all not funny in the slightest -- it would be better just to listen to Ray Stevens ' "" Would Jesus Wear a Rolex on His Television Show "" ) . This would barely qualify as PG-13 ( it is Not Rated ) , but Blockbuster refuses to let anyone under the age of 17 rent this -- as if it was pornographic . Any little kid could go in there and rent the edited version of Requiem for a Dream , but they insist that Zack and Reba is worse . It is , but not in that way . In a way , this worries me -- the only thing left that could offend people is the idea of the suicide at the beginning . If anybody needs to see movies with honestly portrayed suicides ( not this one , but better ones like The Virgin Suicides ) , it 's teenagers . If both of those movies were rated R purely because of the suicide aspect , then I have little chance of turning a story I 've been writing into a PG-13 movie ( the main characters are eleven and a half and twelve ) . Suicide is one of the top three leading causes of death in teenagers ( I think it 's number 2 ) , so chances are that most teens have been or will be affected by it . Just say no to this movie , though . 2/10 .",443,0,0.2189938154853305,0.00031746031746035405,0.00031746031746035405,0.03973103031547886,0.00031746031746035405,0.00031746031746035405,0.00031746031746035405,0.00031746031746035405,0.016502984712267195,0.00031746031746035405,0.00031746031746035405,0.00031746031746035405,0.00031746031746035405,0.00031746031746035405,0.016148217018214846,0.00031746031746035405,0.00031746031746035405,0.00031746031746035405,0.00031746031746035405,0.00031746031746035405,0.5021697563820497,0.00031746031746035405,0.00031746031746035405,0.00031746031746035405,0.00031746031746035405,0.00031746031746035405,0.00031746031746035405,0.00031746031746035405,0.00031746031746035405,0.00031746031746035405,0.00031746031746035405,0.00031746031746035405,0.00031746031746035405,0.00031746031746035405,0.10797703362020211,0.00031746031746035405,0.00031746031746035405,0.016683417437797717,0.00031746031746035405,0.00031746031746035405,0.00031746031746035405,0.00031746031746035405,0.00031746031746035405,0.00031746031746035405,0.0684604116953242,0.00031746031746035405,0.00031746031746035405,0.00031746031746035405,0.00031746031746035405,0.00031746031746035405,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0
9584,0,"I 'm writing this as I watch the DVD . I grabbed for the laptop and went to IMDb during the first song . I did n't know anything about the movie except that a friend said that the show was supposed to be good . It has a decent Netflix rating too , so here I am . Maybe on the stage this worked . But I have to say that the sight of chorus boys dancing and singing completely naked just seems silly . And the lip syncing to a prerecorded score adds to the strangeness . Most of the songs and routines are about aspects of male nudity . This is my idea of nothing , sorry . The score , so far , is generic show tune music . Nothing memorable , or particularly melodic . Everything is to serve the lyrics . Which , I have to say , sound like they were written by a committee . Each song is essentially one extended joke . If the jokes were ten seconds , they might work . These single several - minute - long jokes don't . I'm now watching the movie by chapters -- a few minutes until I get the gist . Kind of in the hopes that one of them will be different , or entertaining enough to keep me from going on to the next scene . Nope . Okay . I 'm finished . So here 's what I think . If you have any experience or long - standing appreciation of musical theater , avoid this -- it 's just not quality . If , however , you 're a gay twenty - something and have never seen or heard a musical comedy , you might be entertained . Or maybe this would hold your interest if you 've never seen a lot of attractive naked men .

In the flashbacks , it shows Kermit , Miss Piggy ( Eric Jacobson , not the original and better Frank Oz ) , Gonzo ( Dave Goelz ) , Fozzie Bear ( also Jacobson ) , Pepe the Prawn ( Bill Barretta ) and all the other Muppets have prepared a stage show for many people to see in the Christmas holiday , and it all seems to be going well . But the really mean Rachel Bitterman ( Joan Cusack ) is determined to either shut the show or the theatre down , and Kermit is doing everything possible to make sure that does n't happen . Of course , Kermit fails the last time , and Bitterman tells him that they are finished , and she can officially take the theatre . This is where Daniel is sent as Kermit 's guardian angel to try and help him , but Kermit is not in the mood , and eventually ends up saying "" I wish I was never born "" . Obviously , you can recognise the spoof of It 's a Wonderful Life , with Kermit as the George Bailey , and Cusack as the Mr. Potter , and in the end , obviously Kermit realises how much he means to everyone , and goes back to find the theatre saved as historical landmark . Also starring Whitmire as Rizzo the Rat and Beaker ; Goelz as Dr. Bunsen Honeydew and Waldorf ; Barretta as Dr. Teeth , Rowlf the Dog and Swedish Chef ; Jacobson as Animal and Yoda ( the only character who sounds similar to Oz 's version ) , William H. Macy as Glenn , Matthew Lillard as Luc Fromage , Carson Daly , Molly Shannon ; Scrubs ' Zach Braff , Sarah Chalke , Neil Flynn , John C. McGinley and Judy Reyes , Mel Brooks as Joe Snow ; Brian Henson as Scooter and Janice ; Jerry Nelson as Robin the Frog , Statler , Pops and Floyd Pepper , and Kevin Clash as Sam the Eagle . The most memorable moment for me is the stage spoof of Moulin Rouge , besides that and the well known faces in it , not fantastic . It was nominated the Emmy for Outstanding Music and Lyrics for the song "" Everyone Matters "" . The Muppets were number 47 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons .

10322,0,"Without being really the worst science fiction film ever made , or the worst I have seen , ' Time Under Fire ' is still much under average . The premises and the first 10 - 15 minutes are not that bad , it starts as a X - Files story , combining Bermuda triangle mysteries with time travel . Pretty soon elements of other genres ( too many ) mix together , but the story never takes off beyond the level of interest of a TV series . Soon , ' Time Under Fire ' quickly degenerates into a series of clichés , not only mixing altogether too many genres but also being unable to create anything memorable in suspense or special effects that would help viewers remember the movie until tomorrow .

10339,0,"This movie has too many things going on . Another reviewer comments on the disjointed , episodic nature of the film as reflecting the director 's memories - that 's fine , if that is how it was written and performed . Instead , what we get is straight - forward narrative - some of the time - that jumps around , under and over , leaves us dangling in some instances , interrupts the flow with unnecessary digressions in other instances , and otherwise simply does n't work . There are also some plot details that just do n't work . For example , why drag a body onto a beach in an urban area in broad daylight , as opposed to night time ? Why leave your flat sheet on the body ? Why would an artist who knew the Joe character for a brief time decide to leave him "" everything "" ( even if it was n't much ) ? This sub - plot was poorly developed to make that point work . For that matter , why even have the man be an invalid or an artist other than to provide the money and the gratuitous nude posing scenes ? He could just as easily have been a photographer , or a opera composer ? For that matter , how does someone rate an apartment in an Opera House - particularly without some clear connection to the Opera ? The coincidences are also both too obvious and to unclear and unexplained . Why would the guys take everything in the warehouse and "" disappear . "" If Tim was a 10 year old school mate in a town as small as Bangor , how could Joe lose track of him for 8 years , especially if they knew each other well enough that one would recommend the other for a job . Some of the other subplots ( like the mother and her boyfriend(s ) and the sister wanting to escape felt like padding . There 's some good ideas that might have made a feature with full development or could have been interesting shorts . As completed , this movie made little sense and offers even less .",374,0,0.20625982036244955,0.0003333333333333625,0.0003333333333333625,0.01902984369938128,0.0003333333333333625,0.0003333333333333625,0.0003333333333333625,0.0003333333333333625,0.0003333333333333625,0.0003333333333333625,0.0003333333333333625,0.016699571542183482,0.0003333333333333625,0.0003333333333333625,0.0003333333333333625,0.0003333333333333625,0.035342427706157815,0.0003333333333333625,0.0003333333333333625,0.05060393872817955,0.21088934763970485,0.0003333333333333625,0.0003333333333333625,0.03457459567877022,0.023070484292966303,0.0003333333333333625,0.0003333333333333625,0.0003333333333333625,0.0003333333333333625,0.0003333333333333625,0.0003333333333333625,0.0003333333333333625,0.0003333333333333625,0.0003333333333333625,0.0003333333333333625,0.0003333333333333625,0.0003333333333333625,0.0003333333333333625,0.15674249293604528,0.03440108301270754,0.020167466888780308,0.01759932494576037,0.0003333333333333625,0.16228626923357903,0.0003333333333333625,0.0003333333333333625,0.0003333333333333625,0.0003333333333333625,0.0003333333333333625,0.0003333333333333625,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

10641,0,"Danny Lee 's performance as a wisecracking cop is the only spot of interest in this film , even though it has an excellent cast including Chow Yun - Fat , Carina Lau , Andy Lau , Shing Fui - On and Alex Man . CYF plays a triad boss who wants to settle down to a life of peace and plenty but Alex Man , a total psycho who has a big grudge against CYF , wo n't let him . CYF tries to escape to Malacca but to no avail . After his family is blown to bits , his cronies dead or turncoat , wounded and broke , CYF returns to Hong Kong to get into some serious revenge . It sounds a lot better than it is . CYF is well - dressed and handsome , looks pained , grimaces and cries on cue , but somehow or another you just do n't care . Andy Lau looks great , but that 's about it . Carina Lau has a tiny , tiny little part which was nice , but she gets a bullet in the head early on so that ends that . Alex Man is a cartoon villain he 's so over - the - top which at times can be intriguing but the writing here is so flat that he just comes across as a garden - variety nut . Danny Lee is great though - too bad he 's only a small blip on the screen of this dark ( literally ) and essentially boring movie . Rent it , do n't buy it . Or just skip it altogether . This is the sequel to "" Rich And Famous "" , even though it apparently was filmed simultaneously ; it was released first because of CYF 's boxoffice power .",309,0,0.00046511627906980796,0.00046511627906980796,0.00046511627906980796,0.00046511627906980796,0.060141758381794155,0.00046511627906980796,0.00046511627906980796,0.0920896827856276,0.11177509971495035,0.00046511627906980796,0.00046511627906980796,0.00046511627906980796,0.00046511627906980796,0.00046511627906980796,0.00046511627906980796,0.00046511627906980796,0.00046511627906980796,0.028462191038834496,0.00046511627906980796,0.00046511627906980796,0.6264062496142387,0.00046511627906980796,0.00046511627906980796,0.00046511627906980796,0.028218288313712737,0.00046511627906980796,0.00046511627906980796,0.00046511627906980796,0.00046511627906980796,0.00046511627906980796,0.00046511627906980796,0.00046511627906980796,0.00046511627906980796,0.00046511627906980796,0.00046511627906980796,0.00046511627906980796,0.00046511627906980796,0.00046511627906980796,0.00046511627906980796,0.00046511627906980796,0.00046511627906980796,0.03290673015084015,0.00046511627906980796,0.00046511627906980796,0.00046511627906980796,0.00046511627906980796,0.00046511627906980796,0.00046511627906980796,0.00046511627906980796,0.00046511627906980796,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
10877,0,"When I first looked at the back of the cover of this film , it seemed like me and my friends could be looking forward to 82 memorable minutes . And it certainly was memorable . Puckoon was the kind of movie where you keep asking yourself how this was possible . How it was possible that it was released on DVD at all . Out of all of the movies available at the video rental store that night ... we might just have picked the worst . And yes , they had Tomb Raider . Absolutely nothing in this movie amused me even slightly . Who came up with the idea that it would be funny if the narrator could change the story by suggestions from the main character ? Out of all the stupid things you can totally ruin a movie with , this is now my favourite . The character Foggerty , the village idiot , played by Nickolas Grace is the most annoying character since they started making movies in color . If there is one single movie that you definately not should see this year , please let it be Puckoon , cause I do n't think it can be any worse . I still wonder if this just might have been the worst way I have spent my money , and take my word for that I have made many lousy purchases over the years .",242,0,0.0003846153846154252,0.0003846153846154252,0.0003846153846154252,0.0003846153846154252,0.0003846153846154252,0.0003846153846154252,0.0003846153846154252,0.0003846153846154252,0.016532444562081524,0.0003846153846154252,0.022352724733491747,0.0003846153846154252,0.0003846153846154252,0.0003846153846154252,0.0003846153846154252,0.0003846153846154252,0.0003846153846154252,0.09195958553141409,0.019612512427430333,0.0003846153846154252,0.7167901835856799,0.0003846153846154252,0.0003846153846154252,0.020452024370381364,0.0003846153846154252,0.0003846153846154252,0.0003846153846154252,0.0003846153846154252,0.0003846153846154252,0.0003846153846154252,0.0003846153846154252,0.0003846153846154252,0.0003846153846154252,0.0003846153846154252,0.0003846153846154252,0.0003846153846154252,0.0003846153846154252,0.0003846153846154252,0.0003846153846154252,0.0312325167727086,0.02801151891223633,0.0003846153846154252,0.0003846153846154252,0.0003846153846154252,0.0003846153846154252,0.03728725833534323,0.0003846153846154252,0.0003846153846154252,0.0003846153846154252,0.0003846153846154252,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

I do not remember this movie being in the theaters , and I 'm sure if it was , it was n't there long . The acting was stale and unconvincing , the dialogue was silly and predictable , and the story was confusing and stupid . Definately one of the worst movies I have ever seen , and I like movies like the ones this has been compared to like Fight Club , but this one does n't come close ! ! Heather Grahm has done much better things since . I gave it a 2 out of 10 but that s because I clicked on the wrong number , I meant to give it a 1 .",182,0,0.00046511627906980547,0.00046511627906980547,0.00046511627906980547,0.024811209703226512,0.00046511627906980547,0.00046511627906980547,0.00046511627906980547,0.00046511627906980547,0.00046511627906980547,0.00046511627906980547,0.00046511627906980547,0.00046511627906980547,0.00046511627906980547,0.00046511627906980547,0.023677725028486325,0.00046511627906980547,0.00046511627906980547,0.00046511627906980547,0.00046511627906980547,0.00046511627906980547,0.517337057157417,0.26121795990997765,0.00046511627906980547,0.00046511627906980547,0.00046511627906980547,0.00046511627906980547,0.00046511627906980547,0.00046511627906980547,0.00046511627906980547,0.00046511627906980547,0.00046511627906980547,0.00046511627906980547,0.00046511627906980547,0.00046511627906980547,0.00046511627906980547,0.00046511627906980547,0.00046511627906980547,0.00046511627906980547,0.00046511627906980547,0.00046511627906980547,0.00046511627906980547,0.00046511627906980547,0.00046511627906980547,0.00046511627906980547,0.15202581564275128,0.00046511627906980547,0.00046511627906980547,0.00046511627906980547,0.00046511627906980547,0.00046511627906980547,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0
11408,0,"After an astronaut dies in space , he is brought back to a military base . Inside the man are discovered alien embryos -- he is the host for what could be a terrible alien invasion ! This film comes to us from director Bernard L. Kowalski , who also directed "" Attack of the Giant Leeches "" ( see separate review ) but may be better known for his work on "" Columbo "" . Executive producer was Roger Corman , known as the creator of much better films than this one ... particularly in the 1960s . This movie is cheesy and poorly constructed . What comes across as interesting is the poor effects , not the actual film itself . One scene shows a close - up of the alien embryos and it 's an embarrassing cartoon representation . Even for 1958 . And then when a full - grown alien appears ... you 'll wonder why he is wearing shoes . Or if you 're really perceptive , you 'll wonder why you 've seen the alien suit in other movies . By no means is this the worst science fiction film you 'll ever see . And you almost have to give it some credit -- the alien host overtaking a military base idea predates both "" The Thing "" and "" Alien "" by a number of years . I do n't know if these films were inspired in any way ( I doubt it ) , but at least it was ahead of its time . Beyond that , though , the film flops and is only great for heckling when drinking . I have n't seen the "" Mystery Science Theater "" version , but this sure is one film worthy of their insults .",303,0,0.0004081632653061669,0.0004081632653061669,0.022335265806278214,0.0004081632653061669,0.04550362094882895,0.0004081632653061669,0.02083373092299493,0.0004081632653061669,0.021133087670361365,0.0004081632653061669,0.0004081632653061669,0.0004081632653061669,0.0004081632653061669,0.0004081632653061669,0.0004081632653061669,0.0004081632653061669,0.0004081632653061669,0.0004081632653061669,0.0004081632653061669,0.0004081632653061669,0.1995384718795226,0.0004081632653061669,0.0004081632653061669,0.0004081632653061669,0.0004081632653061669,0.0004081632653061669,0.0004081632653061669,0.0004081632653061669,0.0004081632653061669,0.0004081632653061669,0.0004081632653061669,0.0004081632653061669,0.08106685368840592,0.0004081632653061669,0.0004081632653061669,0.0004081632653061669,0.0004081632653061669,0.0004081632653061669,0.0004081632653061669,0.0004081632653061669,0.08223833861445665,0.0004081632653061669,0.0004081632653061669,0.33273977307796015,0.17787616351363825,0.0004081632653061669,0.0004081632653061669,0.0004081632653061669,0.0004081632653061669,0.0004081632653061669,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0
11746,0,"Let me begin by saying that I had been eagerly anticipating this film 's release for awhile . After finally getting the chance to see it last night , I 'm sorry to say that I was incredibly disappointed . It 's hard to imagine a film that could make last fall 's "" Exorcist : The Beginning "" look good , but "" Dominion "" does just that . No wait ... it makes it look like a GREAT film . Perhaps I got myself too excited about this movie , and that contributed to the let down . After all , the idea that Warner Bros. was releasing two versions of what is essentially the same film within six months of each other was an exciting attraction . Plus , I 'm a huge fan of Stellan Skarsgard , and in true fashion he gives a great performance , despite the often ridiculous content of the film . On the other hand , the supporting cast in this film is abysmal . Clara Bellar seems to be capable of only one expression - blank stare , and delivers all of her lines with the same monotonous tone , while Gabrielle Mann 's Father Frances is just ridiculous . The effects in this film are laughable at best and the sheer cheesiness of it all is enough to rob the film of any chance of being taken seriously . This movie brought about more stifled giggling than anything else , and with the exception of one really chilling shot that lasted about three - seconds and made my friend cover her eyes and whimper , it neglected to offer anything in the scare department either . I could go into more detail and possibly give away some spoilers , but frankly I 'm too exhausted from thinking about how bad this film was to write all the things I 'd love to say . The saddest part about the whole thing is that the basic idea that both versions of the film tried to give ... a story about a priest who has lost his faith and then regains it after coming to terms with his troubled past ... had huge potential , especially with Skarsgard as leading man . Unfortunately for us , that potential was wasted . Go and see this film only if you 're really curious about how it differs from the Harlin version , but do n't expect to see a good film or you 'll regret wasting your money and two hours of your life . Otherwise , be content with the version first released and move on .",446,0,0.00023809523809526544,0.09925940973939965,0.00023809523809526544,0.013452670722268535,0.016838881842826618,0.00023809523809526544,0.012413498006012382,0.00023809523809526544,0.02780930552302914,0.00023809523809526544,0.03990690063705411,0.00023809523809526544,0.05405727256132896,0.00023809523809526544,0.00023809523809526544,0.00023809523809526544,0.04765153734490523,0.00023809523809526544,0.00023809523809526544,0.00023809523809526544,0.23616388903557967,0.00023809523809526544,0.00023809523809526544,0.00023809523809526544,0.00023809523809526544,0.00023809523809526544,0.00023809523809526544,0.00023809523809526544,0.00023809523809526544,0.00023809523809526544,0.00023809523809526544,0.00023809523809526544,0.0622681567386914,0.00023809523809526544,0.00023809523809526544,0.00023809523809526544,0.00023809523809526544,0.00023809523809526544,0.00023809523809526544,0.014615131977571255,0.00023809523809526544,0.012247729163207396,0.01482292060805444,0.3399212675286418,0.00023809523809526544,0.00023809523809526544,0.00023809523809526544,0.00023809523809526544,0.00023809523809526544,0.00023809523809526544,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

Robert Urich stars as the leader of a group of ice pirates , who steal ice because water is the most valuable substance in the universe now ( how all the poor people stay alive is a mystery ) .

Also in the cast are an embarrassed - looking Anjelica Huston in some hilarious sci - fi get - ups and a pudgy , short - ish Ron Perlman ( whom I thought was seven feet tall from his other roles ! ) . And John Carradine , who looks days from death and Hollywood Squares funnyman ( relative term ) Bruce Vilanch . If you ever wanted to see Bruce Vilanch get decapitated , here 's your film .

But as soon as the movie started , I could n't believe how different it was . At first I was like , okay , so both of her parents are dead ... maybe it 'll be okay . But then came the rest of the movie . By the time it was over I was furious . Nothing was correct but their names and the fact that Vivian fell in love with Aiden . By the end of the book , Gabriel was my all time favorite ... and then the movie goes and turns him into a complete heartless idiot ? ! The movie also showed the shifters , or werewolves , as these vile , evil creatures were as the book shows them as just wanting to fit in and keep their pack safe . They would never kill humans for the fun of it . If they wanted to make a movie like they did , they should have given it a different title and named the characters different .

13139,0,"Honestly , the concept behind "" Masters of Horror "" had something going for it . Big - time horror directors that are now left aside by the industry being given a chance to direct horror again , I was all for it from the start . That is , until I watched some episodes ... Oh boy , it 's really bad TV . Not only does it seem like the directors are being given very little budgets to direct their skits , but there seems to be guidelines as well , like shooting in HD for example . To make a long story short , it 's bad both for artistic and reasons financial reasons . I can not help but compare to the "" Tales From The Crypt "" , and the M.o . H. episodes really do n't stand the comparison . TFTC was good , MOH is bad ; according to me here are a few keys to explain it : TFTC was shorter ( around 25 minutes for each episode ) than MOH ( 50 minutes per episode ) , I believe it allowed denser screenplays , with good ideas reoccurring more often , better overview of an episode , less chances to let the plot be confusing or boring . Duration might have been also the reason why the budget was better spent on TFTC : directors got to have REAL film music composers ( composers on MOH are if inexistent , very bad ) , REAL actors ( whereas on MOH it 's nothing but unknown actor after unknown actor ! ) , REAL directors of photography and , it can help sometimes , REAL film cameras ( while MOH is shot on HD cameras with very wrongly chosen lens - pieces ) , the result of which being that the episodes of TFTC looked and felt "" cinematographic "" in the sense that there was real actors being casted , ranging from Michael J. Fox to Tim Roth to Kyle McLachlan to Kirk Douglas , but there were also film composers behind it , of the range of Alan Silvestri , great directors of photography like Dean Cundey , high - end screenplay writers , and in that sense each "" Tale "" was a little movie of its own true kind . Compared to TFTC , the "" Masters of Horrors "" is quite a lame approach to TV horror . It 's very hard to stand looking at it if your standards regarding cinematography are just a little above average , because it looks the same as any ugly TV serial , if not worse . It gets boring and even annoying incredibly fast , within the first 10 minutes usually . The actors are never - heard before wannabes ( except for Fairuza Balk , Robert Englund , Angela Bettis and a few , but even there , they are the only famous actors of their episodes ) . The director base for MoH was good in the beginning , but it 's getting worst and worst with every episode : now if even the directors are unknown to the world , what remains ? Nothing ! And it 's funny how they are starting to have complete unknown directors while they have n't even had , say , Stan Winston , Dick Maas , William Lustig , Sam Raimi , Eric Red , Robert Harmon , William Friedkin , Jim Muro , Stuart Gordon , Russell Mulcahy ...

13350,0,"A splendid example of how Hollywood could ( and still can ) take a masterpiece of literary fiction and stupidly foul it up . In the case of "" the Big Sky , "" writer Dudley Nichols and company arrogantly assumed they could improve upon a classic pioneer novel by the Pulitzer prize - winning author , A.B. Guthrie . In so doing , they removed the soul of the story and any edge and impact it may have had as a film adaptation . The epic nature of Guthrie 's book and the evolution of its main character , Boone Caudill , from a naive , Kentucky lad into a hardened and competent survivor / mountain man , has been replaced with a downscaled riverboat farce that bears little resemblance to the author 's intent . In the movie version , Boone 's presence is nothing except underwhelming . Intriguing and even shocking plot elements that give Guthrie 's novel impact and excitement have been removed for no apparent reason whatsoever . Most puzzling of all is the emphasis placed upon the Zeb Calloway character , who was an incidental , minor character in the book , only occupying a handful of pages . On the other hand , a very important and fascinating character , Dick Summers , the veteran pioneer , is missing altogether ! ! ! It is also apparent that director Hawks decided the Zeb character in the movie , played by actor Hunnicutt , was n't irritating enough . So Zeb / Hunnicutt was given a significant amount of time doing that obnoxious , voice - over narration that is the Hollywood short cut for incompetent screen writing , editing , and direction . Some movies have actually improved upon the books upon which they were based ( William Wyler 's "" Ben - Hur "" is an excellent example ) . But this is horrible and depressing not only as an adaptation of a novel but as a film unto itself . The story is dull and clichéd , and the characters - at least the ones that have not been edited out of the script - are just shallow and boring shadows of Guthrie 's literary vision . And unfortunately , Kirk Douglas ' star appeal , which could have helped lift this film , was scuttled by the milktoast role he was given . If you can believe it , the film version of Guthrie 's Pulitzer prize - winning sequel , "" The Way West , "" also starring Kirk , is even worse . In my opinion , "" The Big Sky "" further solidifies Howard Hawks ' place as one of the most overrated , tepid directors in the history of cinema .",465,0,0.0002702702702702994,0.0002702702702702994,0.0002702702702702994,0.0002702702702702994,0.0002702702702702994,0.0002702702702702994,0.0002702702702702994,0.0002702702702702994,0.08052122207094904,0.0002702702702702994,0.0002702702702702994,0.0002702702702702994,0.0002702702702702994,0.0002702702702702994,0.0002702702702702994,0.0002702702702702994,0.01579690287190742,0.0002702702702702994,0.0002702702702702994,0.0002702702702702994,0.25187453289882433,0.0002702702702702994,0.0002702702702702994,0.0002702702702702994,0.0002702702702702994,0.0002702702702702994,0.0002702702702702994,0.0002702702702702994,0.0002702702702702994,0.025832710982667127,0.0002702702702702994,0.013839466234027624,0.0002702702702702994,0.0002702702702702994,0.0002702702702702994,0.0002702702702702994,0.28344538977225714,0.0002702702702702994,0.0002702702702702994,0.0002702702702702994,0.0002702702702702994,0.0002702702702702994,0.0002702702702702994,0.26604973087681993,0.0002702702702702994,0.05128869294119487,0.0002702702702702994,0.0002702702702702994,0.0002702702702702994,0.0002702702702702994,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0

13726,0,"I do n't know why , but i thought i 've seen this movie before . Maybe it was the name , maybe it was the way poster looked , i do n't know . Anyway , it was quite promising in the beginning . And even throughout the whole feature there were some bright moments . Maybe its because i 'm not a huge fan of the horrors , and i do n't watch them a lot , but this one actually looked fresh sometimes . But the rest of it is not so good . Laughable at times . The movie is slow paced , sometimes you will get so bored you 'd forget what was the story about . Characters are not great either . All of them . The butcher is OK , seems creepy and crazy enough . Although i did n't get what were those weird looking things on his chest ( that whole scene just looked fake and kind of out - of - the - blue ) , and why he was collecting those in jars at home ? The main lead is plain . His character is really hard to believe in , and very undeveloped . But i guess that s scenarists fault . Like why he cried when he was taking pictures of his girlfriend ? Side cast is bad too . But the main thing i hated in this movie was the girl . My god , when will women in horror movies have any brains ? Its ridiculous . The girl finds out that a maniac took her boyfriends camera , tries going to police , that fails , and then she thinks of the best idea ever . Why do n't we just go and take it ! I know where the maniac lives ! Yup ! That s swell ! And then look for the camera in the bathroom ! Why not ? And then walk in the room , see a bag that was not there before , and just have a look inside . Maybe camera is there ? Not there . But loads of interesting stuff . Shiny . Mmmm . To realize that bag means that the butcher came back is too hard for her tiny tiny brain . Then of course the never ending "" falling while running away "" trick , that really made it look bad . Then , to put the final nail into the character , in the end of the movie , she walks into the wagon FULL with dead bodies hanging feet up , screams "" Noooo "" like she just ripped her Gucci bag , and walks further into the wagon ... Jeez . Come on . No one else thinks its just , well , stupid ? Just awful . If her character was n't so bad , maybe the movie would get another star or two from me . And i would even forgive MMT characters that can take a hit in the head with a steel hammer ( that dude in the train who the conductor killed ) , butcher vests that can protect from bullets , weird and cheap looking monsters in the end ( i did n't read Clive Barkers novel , so i have no idea where those monsters came from ) , the fact that no one cared that hundreds ( judging on the skeletons in the dungeon ) disappeared in the city , and main character that did n't bleed to death when he got his tongue ripped out ( he barely noticed it i guess ) . Oh , and the predictable ending . Damn , i knew the ending half way in , its just disappointing . The only reason i 'm still giving some credit to the makers , is that the movie in general looks better than most of the horrors i 've watched past few months . Visual style is nice , some shots were really nice and good CGI that made the killings look really brutal . ( although blood did n't look real at all ) I guess some people will enjoy it , some , like me , will watch it if there is nothing else to watch , some will absolutely hate it .",728,0,0.00013333333333335093,0.039769501009568844,0.00013333333333335093,0.00013333333333335093,0.00013333333333335093,0.00013333333333335093,0.00013333333333335093,0.00013333333333335093,0.00013333333333335093,0.00013333333333335093,0.00013333333333335093,0.00013333333333335093,0.11842772974451578,0.00013333333333335093,0.013446809790190984,0.00013333333333335093,0.00013333333333335093,0.00013333333333335093,0.00013333333333335093,0.00013333333333335093,0.6200718416675071,0.10365325077006451,0.00013333333333335093,0.00013333333333335093,0.00013333333333335093,0.00013333333333335093,0.00013333333333335093,0.00013333333333335093,0.00013333333333335093,0.00013333333333335093,0.00013333333333335093,0.00013333333333335093,0.044774453809614236,0.00013333333333335093,0.029867633210988447,0.00013333333333335093,0.016648691854388564,0.00013333333333335093,0.00013333333333335093,0.00013333333333335093,0.00013333333333335093,0.00013333333333335093,0.007873421476494068,0.00013333333333335093,0.00013333333333335093,0.00013333333333335093,0.00013333333333335093,0.00013333333333335093,0.00013333333333335093,0.00013333333333335093,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
14095,0,"I wish I 'd known more about this movie when I rented it . I 'd put it in my queue on the basis of Heather Graham and her strong cred as an actress ( IMHO ) . While parts of the movie were charming , much of the movie felt contrived , undeveloped , or otherwise just boring or predictable . Not to mention the ICK factor of so many people thinking the sibs were a couple ... I do n't care how big a part of the story line that is , it still felt a bit , um , gross . And Charlie , for a zoologist , she certainly does n't seem to be very attuned to signals from other Homo sapiens . What was it about her ( besides her hotness and some common interests ) that made Gray fall for her ? The story could have been so much more interesting with a little more depth . High points - Molly Shannon ( although I do agree with the reviewer who found her annoying on occasion ) , the cabbie in drag , and the dance sequences ( if Sam & Gray were such great dancers , I wish we 'd seen more of that , as the bits we were shown were indeed better than most of the rest of the movie ) .

14505,0,"This 1973 TV remake of the Billy Wilder classic is inferior to the original . Surprise!First , the good things . Lee J. Cobb makes a terrific Barton Keyes . He 's not as good as Edward G. Robinson , of course , but he 's the only reason to watch this . This remake 's only improvement over the original is that it cuts down the role of Lola Dietrichson , the step - daughter of the femme fatale , Phyllis Dietrichson . And that 's it for the good things . The bad things are many . The director records everything in an indifferent manner : if you watched the film with the sound muted you 'd hardly get the impression that anything especially interesting was happening . Because of modern bad taste , the film must be in color instead of black and white . Because of 1970s bad taste , all the sets are distractingly ugly . Walter Neff 's expensive apartment , in particular , is hideous . The modern setting hurts in a lot of small ways . Train trips were a bit more unusual in the 70s than in the 40s , so Mr. Dietrichson 's decision to take a train seems more of a contrivance . Men stopped wearing hats , which prevents Walter from covering up his brown hair while posing as the white - haired Mr. Dietrichson . Women in mourning stopped wearing veils , which robs Samantha Eggar of a prop Barbara Stanwyck made splendid use of in a key scene . ( Oddly , Lola still has the line where she reveals that her stepmother was trying on a black hat and veil before she had need of them.)Stephen Bochco keeps much of the Billy Wilder - Raymond Chandler script the same . But he makes a lot of tiny , inexplicable changes to the dialogue which leave the script slightly flabby where once it was lean and muscular . Outrageously , the famous motorcycle - cop banter is gone , but look closely and you 'll see what looks like a post - production cut where those lines should have been . Bochco may not be to blame . Richard Crenna is passable as Walter Neff . What might have made this version tolerable is a really splendid Phyllis Dietrichson . Instead we get Samantha Eggar , who comes off like a standard - issue villainess from "" Barnaby Jones . "" But who can blame Eggar ? With a director who barely seems interested in what 's happening in front of the camera , how could Barbara Stanwyck herself have come off well ?",448,0,0.0002941176470588507,0.0002941176470588507,0.0002941176470588507,0.0002941176470588507,0.0002941176470588507,0.0002941176470588507,0.0002941176470588507,0.15120411699096117,0.06607370642923402,0.0002941176470588507,0.0002941176470588507,0.0002941176470588507,0.0002941176470588507,0.0002941176470588507,0.0002941176470588507,0.0002941176470588507,0.0002941176470588507,0.0002941176470588507,0.0002941176470588507,0.0002941176470588507,0.17773241028287823,0.24542858432943498,0.0002941176470588507,0.0002941176470588507,0.030844627417989143,0.0002941176470588507,0.0002941176470588507,0.0002941176470588507,0.01571739487116614,0.0002941176470588507,0.0002941176470588507,0.03132199693301634,0.0002941176470588507,0.0002941176470588507,0.0002941176470588507,0.0724701710371824,0.0002941176470588507,0.0002941176470588507,0.033382876253950894,0.0002941176470588507,0.0002941176470588507,0.01514985390814222,0.0002941176470588507,0.13341230213955946,0.0002941176470588507,0.0002941176470588507,0.01608548881824894,0.0002941176470588507,0.0002941176470588507,0.0002941176470588507,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0

15074,0,"Director Jonathan Lynn has made some underrated comedies in the past , like ' Greedy ' and ' Clue ' . This is n't one of them . More akin to a ' Police Academy ' film than its inspiration , it stars Steve Martin in the old Phil Silvers role as an army sergeant forever pulling scams under the nose of his superiors . But the idyllic life of Bilko and his lazy platoon looks shaky when an old enemy visits the base determined to catch Bilko in the act . Nothing much happens , really . It 's all quite dull . It 's not very funny . Martin , Dan Aykroyd and Phil Hartman squeeze a couple of laughs out through sheer effort , but they 're all better than this and it 's quite painful watching them work with such thin material .",147,0,0.0010000000000000748,0.0010000000000000748,0.0010000000000000748,0.0010000000000000748,0.0010000000000000748,0.0010000000000000748,0.0010000000000000748,0.0010000000000000748,0.0010000000000000748,0.0010000000000000748,0.0010000000000000748,0.0010000000000000748,0.0010000000000000748,0.0010000000000000748,0.0010000000000000748,0.0010000000000000748,0.0010000000000000748,0.0010000000000000748,0.0010000000000000748,0.0010000000000000748,0.2176754419302886,0.18157372662447044,0.0010000000000000748,0.11665496997139375,0.0010000000000000748,0.0010000000000000748,0.0010000000000000748,0.0010000000000000748,0.0010000000000000748,0.0010000000000000748,0.0010000000000000748,0.0010000000000000748,0.0010000000000000748,0.0010000000000000748,0.0010000000000000748,0.0010000000000000748,0.0010000000000000748,0.0010000000000000748,0.0010000000000000748,0.0010000000000000748,0.0010000000000000748,0.0010000000000000748,0.0010000000000000748,0.2988792307870888,0.0010000000000000748,0.14021663068675516,0.0010000000000000748,0.0010000000000000748,0.0010000000000000748,0.0010000000000000748,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,1

15756,0,"Even with a cast that boasts such generally reliable names as Val Kilmer and Lisa Kudrow , Wonderland fails to yield any sense of depth to this film . It barely brushes the surface of the incidents that happened on that July night in 1981 . Kilmer just goes through the motions as John Holmes and Kudrow and Kate Bosworth are both hopefully miscast in the other two lead roles ; as Holmes 's wife and underage girlfriend , respectively . The rest of the cast has such small roles that it 's impossible to get any dimensions from them .

16128,0,"I remember loving this show when I was a kid . I thought the helicopter was the coolest thing I 've seen . It was ultra high - tech for it 's time . It could repel enemy fire , do all sorts of acrobatics in the air , and take down nearly anything in it 's way . Now I go back and watch it today and am surprised how lousy this show really is . The casts members are hardly compelling , there are a lot of cheesy moments , and the fight scenes are incredibly fake looking . And nearly every ending has the same helicopter fighting crap with the obvious reuse of grainy low quality stock footage . Lot of the footages appear to date from the Vietnam War era . Airwolf has basically the same theme as Knight Rider , except the crime - fighting vehicle of choice is a helicopter instead of a car . After watching a few episodes , I found myself utterly bored .

Now , when Ben Lyons comes on I feel like I 'm watching "" Teen News "" -- you know , that kids ' news show , hosted by kids for kids ? Manckiewitz is not much better . It 's obvious they 've encountered only a steady diet of mainstream films their entire lives . The idea that these two rank amateurs have anything of interest or consequence to say about motion pictures is ludicrous . If they are reviewing a non - formula film , they are completely lost . Show them something original and intelligent -- they just find it "" confusing "" . Wait -- I think I get it ... ABC is owned by Disney ... Disney makes movies for kids . While Siskel , Ebert , and Roper promoted independent films and were only hit - or - miss with the big budget studio productions -- what a surprise : these two guys LOVE the big studio schlock and only manage to tolerate a few indies . Plus everyone knows the age group TV advertisers are aiming for . The blatant nepotism is the icing on the cake . In what alternate universe do these guys qualify as film critics ?",258,0,0.000512820512820556,0.000512820512820556,0.000512820512820556,0.000512820512820556,0.000512820512820556,0.12969265069124314,0.000512820512820556,0.000512820512820556,0.000512820512820556,0.000512820512820556,0.000512820512820556,0.000512820512820556,0.000512820512820556,0.000512820512820556,0.000512820512820556,0.000512820512820556,0.000512820512820556,0.000512820512820556,0.000512820512820556,0.000512820512820556,0.45776972201010946,0.000512820512820556,0.000512820512820556,0.000512820512820556,0.000512820512820556,0.000512820512820556,0.000512820512820556,0.000512820512820556,0.000512820512820556,0.000512820512820556,0.000512820512820556,0.000512820512820556,0.04481811588308005,0.000512820512820556,0.0543562185512004,0.000512820512820556,0.000512820512820556,0.000512820512820556,0.000512820512820556,0.000512820512820556,0.000512820512820556,0.000512820512820556,0.000512820512820556,0.21306868299606233,0.07773050730420009,0.000512820512820556,0.000512820512820556,0.000512820512820556,0.000512820512820556,0.000512820512820556,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0
16495,0,"I watched Written on The Wind starring Rock Hudson , Lauren Becall , Robert Stack & Dorothy Malone- Robert Stack was terrible- just bloody horrible- he was supposed to be a charming jet - setting millionaire- instead he came off like a jerk from the word go- the plot was stupid and overwrought and the 3 "" romantic "" leads had no chemistry . Somehow Dorothy Malone won an Oscar for best supporting actress- although her campy tramp character was boring- think the older sister from Splendour in The Grass filled with malice and bitterness and lacking charisma . Director Douglas Sirk has the entire cast overact their way through dialogue that felt forced and the end result was a waste of 99 minutes .

16522,0,"I very nearly walked out , but I 'd paid my money , and my nearly - as - disgusted friend wanted to hold out . After the endearing , wide - eyed innocence of "" A New Hope "" and the thrilling sophistication of "" The Empire Strikes Back , "" I remember awaiting "" Return of the Jedi "" with almost aching anticipation . But from the opening scene of this insultingly commercial sewage , I was bitterly disappointed , and enraged at Lucas . He should have been ashamed of himself , but this abomination undeniably proves that he does n't have subatomic particle of shame in his cold , greedy heart . Episode I would go on to reinforce this fact -- your honor , I call Jarjar Binks ( but please issue barf bags to the members of the jury first).From the initial raising of the gate at Jabba 's lair , this "" film "" was nothing more than a two - plus - hour commercial for as many licensable , profit - making action figures as Lucas could cram into it -- the pig - like guards , the hokey flesh - pigtailed flunky , that vile muppet - pet of Jabba 's , the new and recycled cabaret figures , the monsters , etc . , etc . , ad vomitum . Then there were the detestably cute and marketable Ewoks . Pile on top of that all of the rebel alliance aliens . Fifteen seconds each on - screen ( or less ) and the kiddies just GOTTA have one for their collection . The blatant , exploitative financial baiting of children is nauseating . Lucas did n't even bother to come up with a new plot -- he just exhumed the Death Star from "" A New Hope "" and heaved in a boatload of cheap sentiment . What an appalling slap in the face to his fans . I ca n't shake the notion that Lucas took a perverse pleasure in inflicting this dreck on his fans : "" I 've got these lemmings hooked so bad that I can crank out the worst piece of stinking , putrid garbage that I could dream up , and they 'll flock to the theaters to scarf it up . Plus , all the kiddies will whine and torture their parents until they buy the brats a complete collection of action figures of every single incidental undeveloped , cartoonish caricature that I stuffed in , and I get a cut from every single one . It 'll make me even more obscenely rich . ""There may have been a paltry , partial handful of redeeming moments in this miserable rip - off . I seem to recall that Harrison Ford managed to just barely keep his nose above the surface of this cesspool . But whatever tiny few bright spots there may be are massively obliterated by the offensive commercialism that Lucas so avariciously embraced in this total , absolute sell - out to profit .",515,0,0.00034482758620693675,0.18090525880017427,0.00034482758620693675,0.0154199062066977,0.00034482758620693675,0.00034482758620693675,0.00034482758620693675,0.00034482758620693675,0.00034482758620693675,0.00034482758620693675,0.00034482758620693675,0.00034482758620693675,0.23491203519100357,0.00034482758620693675,0.00034482758620693675,0.00034482758620693675,0.00034482758620693675,0.04063458131981179,0.00034482758620693675,0.00034482758620693675,0.00034482758620693675,0.07829263067394988,0.00034482758620693675,0.00034482758620693675,0.00034482758620693675,0.00034482758620693675,0.00034482758620693675,0.00034482758620693675,0.00034482758620693675,0.00034482758620693675,0.00034482758620693675,0.00034482758620693675,0.054608851234870345,0.00034482758620693675,0.024225555076831825,0.11876673167709983,0.00034482758620693675,0.00034482758620693675,0.00034482758620693675,0.02388849513329946,0.00034482758620693675,0.00034482758620693675,0.00034482758620693675,0.2145528512379837,0.00034482758620693675,0.00034482758620693675,0.00034482758620693675,0.00034482758620693675,0.00034482758620693675,0.00034482758620693675,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
16654,0,"STAR RATING : * * * * * Saturday Night * * * * Friday Night * * * Friday Morning * * Sunday Night * Monday Morning McBain ( played by Gary Busey , before the name became synonymous with the character in The Simpsons ) is a ( typically ) unorthodox cop who gets results but winds his superiors up something rotten . Avoiding the cliché of his partner being killed at the beginning of the film , the plot instead takes a different turn and sees him assigned to travel to Mexico where a top secret American super tank with incredible firepower and imaging capabilities has been smuggled through , only to be taken hostage , along with the crew , by a gang of terrorists . This cheap looking ( even by 80s standards ) , boring little action film was a bizarre career move for Gary Busey after making an impression as the flame haired villain Mr Joshua in Lethal Weapon . He just goes through the motions with his cardboard character here , edgy and zany as ever ( with ' butthorn ' being his trademark put down for the bad guys ) , but without the material to back him up . Henry Silva has presence as a screen villain , but he 's totally miscast here as an Arab leader ( in a red beret ! ) and the awful script gives him some really clunky lines of dull dialogue that make his performance come off as laughably wooden . He 's just one of a host of action film character actors , including L.Q. Jones and Lincoln Kilpatrick , who pop up but fail to add anything to the mix . After a dull first half without much exciting action , things do pick up a bit at the end , but it 's too little too late and none of it manages the task of being any fun . *",330,0,0.0003571428571428904,0.0003571428571428904,0.0003571428571428904,0.0003571428571428904,0.0003571428571428904,0.0003571428571428904,0.0003571428571428904,0.0003571428571428904,0.0003571428571428904,0.0003571428571428904,0.0003571428571428904,0.0003571428571428904,0.0003571428571428904,0.0003571428571428904,0.01818979263351295,0.0003571428571428904,0.0003571428571428904,0.0003571428571428904,0.0003571428571428904,0.06821243729517311,0.28360292515628754,0.280101836960968,0.0003571428571428904,0.0003571428571428904,0.0003571428571428904,0.0003571428571428904,0.0003571428571428904,0.0003571428571428904,0.0003571428571428904,0.0003571428571428904,0.0003571428571428904,0.059748335501828946,0.05338781385586975,0.0003571428571428904,0.0003571428571428904,0.0003571428571428904,0.0003571428571428904,0.0003571428571428904,0.0003571428571428904,0.0003571428571428904,0.0003571428571428904,0.0003571428571428904,0.0003571428571428904,0.2213997157392153,0.0003571428571428904,0.0003571428571428904,0.0003571428571428904,0.0003571428571428904,0.0003571428571428904,0.0003571428571428904,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

17105,0,"The premise of this movie is revealed on the DVD box . A textile worker develops a miracle fabric that does n't degrade . But the movie fails to get on with it . Instead it pads for 45 minutes , noodling around a preamble before he makes the big discovery . Since audiences do n't benefit much from seeing a whiz kid figuring things out , it 's a strange choice : the movie has successfully been prevented from engaging any topic . Once the fabric is discovered , the movie too rapidly establishes that both industry bigwigs , and blue - collar co - workers want the invention squelched , leaving the movie with just two flimsy movements ; inventing the chemical , and running from oppressors . I ca n't understand why anyone would describe this as comedy . The tone is n't funny or comical . It 's more like serious social criticism of the day : that capitalism warps both supply chains and production . Which in turn prevents innovation from reaching and improving the world . Yes , that 's probably true , but without some toying with an attitude towards that fact , the movie is simply an earnest argument . You 'll need an extremely broad definition of comedy to find any here . This is more like a British Meet John Doe ( Meet Nigel Doe ? ) .",238,0,0.24212797621723423,0.0005128205128205571,0.0005128205128205571,0.0005128205128205571,0.0005128205128205571,0.0005128205128205571,0.0005128205128205571,0.0005128205128205571,0.0005128205128205571,0.0005128205128205571,0.0005128205128205571,0.0005128205128205571,0.0005128205128205571,0.0005128205128205571,0.02615384608173793,0.0005128205128205571,0.0005128205128205571,0.04225312652694851,0.026151392413515478,0.0005128205128205571,0.6163379212157067,0.0005128205128205571,0.0005128205128205571,0.0005128205128205571,0.0005128205128205571,0.0005128205128205571,0.024411634980752554,0.0005128205128205571,0.0005128205128205571,0.0005128205128205571,0.0005128205128205571,0.0005128205128205571,0.0005128205128205571,0.0005128205128205571,0.0005128205128205571,0.0005128205128205571,0.0005128205128205571,0.0005128205128205571,0.0005128205128205571,0.0005128205128205571,0.0005128205128205571,0.0005128205128205571,0.0005128205128205571,0.0005128205128205571,0.0005128205128205571,0.0005128205128205571,0.0005128205128205571,0.0005128205128205571,0.0005128205128205571,0.0005128205128205571,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
17250,0,"I do not know if this movies problems are more the fault of Direction or Script . As you will see in many reviews the editing style is way overdone . It is absolutely distracting and without substance , which could be considered a good thing if you look at some of the quotes from the movie . I do not write many reviews here , but felt this movie was so awful that it deserved comment . Movies like this erode at Movie making as an Art form . Movies like this one show more and more clearly that the current Reality focus in cinema is revealing the quality of the characters behind them . People hone there craft , there 5 senses , and there business sense - overlooking there own inner life . However I do not put blame on them , it is more and more the unfortunate condition of this age - qualified by films like this one . But by proxy these Manufacturers I would dare not call Artists vomit there lack of inner life or regard onto the screen - diffusing it to everyone . A story of bounty hunters , guns guns and more guns , heavy handed flaunting of sex - for the oh so popular actress ( did they write the lap dance scene after they signed her ? ) , over saturated , over exaggerated , one liners , non - linear plots . All different and yet all the same . Annoying overwhelming music to push the emotion down your throat . A story ? a development of character ? or just withheld , missing information , revealed at the end to create the * effect * of a story - as if one took place . It altogether lacks anything remotely resembling subtlety . It is a caricature of stereotypes and genre . Where are the films with Awareness ? What about subtlety of sound and music that you are not even aware is there ? What about the depth of a look ? What about editing with a point about mind and consciousness ? yes even in action films this can happen . Sure they have honed a craft ; but what use is it without soul or wisdom ? of insight into the human condition ? Can the people who commented and said that this is an apogee of art , or compare this to Picasso and others - I say put this next to Gandhi or the Godfather , even the original trilogy of star wars or the lord of the rings ; then look me in the face and say it again . It is a good crew , but they need some help with depth and story . I hope they get it because I like the crews previous work . better luck next time .",484,0,0.1786069894468766,0.00022988505747129014,0.015109288168477899,0.00022988505747129014,0.00022988505747129014,0.00022988505747129014,0.00022988505747129014,0.00022988505747129014,0.00022988505747129014,0.00022988505747129014,0.00022988505747129014,0.00022988505747129014,0.00022988505747129014,0.00022988505747129014,0.00022988505747129014,0.00022988505747129014,0.00022988505747129014,0.00022988505747129014,0.00022988505747129014,0.00022988505747129014,0.3245114726770604,0.00022988505747129014,0.00022988505747129014,0.00022988505747129014,0.00022988505747129014,0.00022988505747129014,0.049438846472185154,0.00022988505747129014,0.033676483946599875,0.00022988505747129014,0.00022988505747129014,0.00022988505747129014,0.00022988505747129014,0.00022988505747129014,0.00022988505747129014,0.00022988505747129014,0.00022988505747129014,0.00022988505747129014,0.00022988505747129014,0.00022988505747129014,0.00022988505747129014,0.00022988505747129014,0.00022988505747129014,0.27154038374449374,0.11723147807304099,0.00022988505747129014,0.00022988505747129014,0.00022988505747129014,0.00022988505747129014,0.00022988505747129014,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0

The main heroine , the girl who always survives in other slasher films , is murdered here . There , I just saved you 79 minutes of your life . This is one of those cheap movies that was thrown together in the middle of the slasher era of the ' 80 's . Despite killing the heroine off , this is just substandard junk . Both priests and college students get a bad rap here . They are pictured as oversexed , sociopathic morons who have way too many internal problems to deal with what looks like junior college campus life ... and the college students come off even worse . ""Splatter University "" is just gunk to put in your VCR when you have nothing better to do , although I suggest watching your head cleaner tape , that would be more entertaining .

18112,0,"Naming the absolutely most pathetic piece of crap in cinematic history is not an easy task , candidates being so abundant , but Nemesis 2 has been my personal favorite ever since I saw it . It was so funny we had to rent it again the next day , and again I laughed so hard I was literally rolling on the floor . ( This usually only happens when I see Monty Python 's "" Scott of the Antarctic"".)Throughout the whole movie , an overwhelming what - the - heck - feeling firmly grasps the viewer . I 'm utterly confounded that this clumsy home video ever made it to production stage . It 's supposed to be a sequel , yet has no apparent connection whatsoever with the first film . The hero has the same name , but this time "" Alex "" is female , although it took us half way into the movie to stop guessing , what with all the muscles and the barbarian - nomad outfit!There is really no plot at all , it 's merely a prolonged chase scene , only it 's so slow - paced and senseless that calling it a chase scene makes it sound way more interesting than it really is . There is almost no dialogue , which is just as well considering the quality of it , and then the film suddenly just comes to an abrupt end after a blatant action scene with lots of gasoline explosions , without ever really explaining what it was all about . Luckily , it never gets boring , because there 's something silly and phony going on at all times!Terrible movies are usually just tedious , but Nemesis 2 is such a perfect mixture of over - seriousness and utter nonintentional wackiness that it 's truly entertaining . Rent this film , or buy it even , you wo n't be disappointed !",325,0,0.00033333333333336693,0.00033333333333336693,0.018011400163922792,0.00033333333333336693,0.00033333333333336693,0.00033333333333336693,0.00033333333333336693,0.00033333333333336693,0.00033333333333336693,0.00033333333333336693,0.00033333333333336693,0.00033333333333336693,0.00033333333333336693,0.00033333333333336693,0.032555232735522376,0.00033333333333336693,0.00033333333333336693,0.0280117416640098,0.00033333333333336693,0.00033333333333336693,0.37435846104333864,0.1347413369897565,0.00033333333333336693,0.00033333333333336693,0.00033333333333336693,0.00033333333333336693,0.00033333333333336693,0.00033333333333336693,0.01758094467102082,0.00033333333333336693,0.00033333333333336693,0.017344393430466724,0.00033333333333336693,0.00033333333333336693,0.00033333333333336693,0.00033333333333336693,0.00033333333333336693,0.00033333333333336693,0.00033333333333336693,0.00033333333333336693,0.00033333333333336693,0.00033333333333336693,0.00033333333333336693,0.22850144247669568,0.00033333333333336693,0.10312913384319077,0.03243257964874127,0.00033333333333336693,0.00033333333333336693,0.00033333333333336693,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0

The only redeeming qualities of this flick are the ( mostly ) marginal splatter effects .

C'mon - rent a Betacam at least , I 've seen porn with better production values ( and better acting as well).Acting - sucked ! But not in the Troma or Full Moon sort of way . Story - contrived ! But that s what you get from films like these . Very loose!Sets & Props - sucked ! My 16 year old brother makes more elaborate sets for our house on Halloween . Dubbing and dialogue - sucked ! Horrible voice acting ( I should n't even call it acting ) and every other word is "" S**t "" or "" F**k"" .

18940,0,"I have just seen this movie and have not read the book . The good thing of the movie is that at some parts it gets you thinking for a little while on the spiritual subject , evolution , sincronicity and your part in the world . However , the movie 's immersion is easily broken and there is very little rapport between the viewer and the characters . It is very clear that the book looses a lot in this movie version . The events that were suppose to show sincronicity taking place are almost unrecognizable . A lot of reasoning has to be done for the viewer to see that the scene indicates a coincidence , and even more to imagine that it has something to do with a greater purpose . Enlightenment scenes are visually poor and do not create the better feeling that it was supposed to . Do you recall the enlightenment with Keanu Reeves ( in Little Buddha ) ? Well , this is nothing like that . Most scenes are poorly executed . There are a lot of scenes that really do n't develop the story and also do not help in creating an atmosphere . The better actors in this movie , namely Hector Elizondo , Joaquim de Almeida and Jürgen Prochnow can not save it . The first 2 seem to have gotten more scenes than their characters should in an attempt to save the movie , and because they were paid more , but this does not work . Most of the scenes are not really necessary and do not help the story at all . Jürgen does good in his scenes and sells as an evil guy ( as always ) , but the script does not help him at all . The scene where he first tries to convince John ( Matthew Settle ) to join him is just bad script . The execution of the scene when he dies in an explosion is absurdly bad executed . The flashbacks throughout the movie can not even be commented . Overall this movie is a big waist of time , read the book ! I have not read it , but it is probably a billion times better than this , it has to be . It is so bad that I had to write my first comment in IMDb .",402,0,0.10221884888176642,0.0002469135802469311,0.0002469135802469311,0.0002469135802469311,0.0002469135802469311,0.0002469135802469311,0.0002469135802469311,0.0002469135802469311,0.013052165355800569,0.0002469135802469311,0.0002469135802469311,0.0002469135802469311,0.0002469135802469311,0.0002469135802469311,0.0002469135802469311,0.0002469135802469311,0.03497167640482673,0.0002469135802469311,0.0002469135802469311,0.0002469135802469311,0.316533573755696,0.3794174760860035,0.0002469135802469311,0.0002469135802469311,0.0002469135802469311,0.0002469135802469311,0.0002469135802469311,0.0002469135802469311,0.0002469135802469311,0.0002469135802469311,0.0002469135802469311,0.0002469135802469311,0.0002469135802469311,0.0002469135802469311,0.0002469135802469311,0.0002469135802469311,0.14294206198504195,0.0002469135802469311,0.0002469135802469311,0.0002469135802469311,0.0002469135802469311,0.0002469135802469311,0.0002469135802469311,0.0002469135802469311,0.0002469135802469311,0.0002469135802469311,0.0002469135802469311,0.0002469135802469311,0.0002469135802469311,0.0002469135802469311,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
19100,0,"This British film is truly awful , and it 's hard to believe that Glenn Ford is in it , although he pretty much sleepwalks through it . The idea of a bomb on a train sounds good ... but it turns out this train ends up parked for the majority of the film ! No action , no movement , just a static train . The area where the train is parked is evacuated , so it 's not like there 's any danger to anyone either . In fact , this film could be used in a film class to show how NOT to make a suspense film . True suspense is generated by letting the audience know things that the characters do n't , a fact apparently unknown to the director . SPOILER : the train actually has two bombs on it , but we are led to believe there is only one . After the first bomb is defused , it feels as if there is no longer a reason to watch the film any more . But at the last minute , the villain , who has no apparent motivation for his actions , reveals there are two . Nor are we certain WHEN the bombs will go off , so we do n't even have a classic "" ticking bomb "" tension sequence . A good 10 minutes or more are spent watching Glenn Ford 's French wife thinking about leaving him , and then wondering where he is . She 's such an annoying character that we do n't care whether she reconciles with him , so when she does , there 's nothing emotional about it . Most of the other characters are fairly devoid of personality , and none have any problems or issues . It 's only 72 minutes , but it feels long because it 's tedious and dull . Do n't waste your time .",327,0,0.0003921568627451335,0.0003921568627451335,0.0003921568627451335,0.01960554459079897,0.0003921568627451335,0.0003921568627451335,0.0003921568627451335,0.0003921568627451335,0.0003921568627451335,0.0003921568627451335,0.0003921568627451335,0.0003921568627451335,0.21862714888930262,0.0003921568627451335,0.0003921568627451335,0.0003921568627451335,0.0003921568627451335,0.0003921568627451335,0.039600581667186024,0.0003921568627451335,0.0003921568627451335,0.13212771762677344,0.0003921568627451335,0.0003921568627451335,0.0003921568627451335,0.0003921568627451335,0.0003921568627451335,0.0003921568627451335,0.0003921568627451335,0.02100690146197237,0.0003921568627451335,0.0003921568627451335,0.0003921568627451335,0.0003921568627451335,0.0003921568627451335,0.0003921568627451335,0.0003921568627451335,0.0003921568627451335,0.0003921568627451335,0.0003921568627451335,0.0003921568627451335,0.0003921568627451335,0.05903633325636986,0.49313302740955606,0.0003921568627451335,0.0003921568627451335,0.0003921568627451335,0.0003921568627451335,0.0003921568627451335,0.0003921568627451335,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
19183,0,"While the original titillates the intellect , this cheap remake is designed purely to shock the sensibilities . Instead of intricate plot - twists , this so - called thriller just features sudden and seemingly random story changes that serve only to debase it further with each bizarre development . Worst of all , replacing the original spicy dialog is an overturned saltshaker full of unnecessary four - letter words , leaving behind a stark , but uninteresting taste . There was promise -- unfulfilled promise . The prospect of Michael Caine pulling off a Patty Duke - like Keller - to - Sullivan graduation is admittedly intriguing . Unfortunately , this brilliant and respected actor only tarnished his reputation , first by accepting the role in this horribly re - scripted nonsense and then by turning in a performance that only looks competent when compared to Jude Law 's amateurish overacting . If you have n't seen the classic original , overlook its dated visuals and gimmicks . Hunt it down , watch it , and just enjoy a story - and - a - half .

19254,0,"As an ordinary movie - watcher I ca n't say I enjoyed watching this one . It 's not too emotional for a drama , not too gripping for a thriller , not too fast for an action . Plus , some moments of the movie are hardly credible . OK , I understand , soldiers become a bit out of their mind out there , but it 's hard to believe that a person would risk his life , carjack into the middle of a hostile city , and after being shouted at by a professor 's wife run away , without having asked a question ( in a proper way ) . It would seem terribly romantic if it were an animation or so , but it 's supposed to be a SERIOUS film about war .. There are several episodes like this , so the whole picture makes an impression that it 's just a raw preview of a movie , and it needs considerable work . It feels like the movie makers wanted to create an image of an emotional brave soldier , but all these ' curves ' of his psychology seem simply unnatural . This picture left a question in my head : WHY ? Why they gave it an Oscar ? Why SIX ? And IMHO it 's the most thrilling part of the movie :)",233,0,0.2986165300702959,0.00045454545454549206,0.00045454545454549206,0.00045454545454549206,0.00045454545454549206,0.00045454545454549206,0.00045454545454549206,0.00045454545454549206,0.00045454545454549206,0.00045454545454549206,0.00045454545454549206,0.00045454545454549206,0.00045454545454549206,0.00045454545454549206,0.00045454545454549206,0.00045454545454549206,0.00045454545454549206,0.00045454545454549206,0.00045454545454549206,0.00045454545454549206,0.41301602575958823,0.00045454545454549206,0.00045454545454549206,0.00045454545454549206,0.00045454545454549206,0.00045454545454549206,0.00045454545454549206,0.00045454545454549206,0.00045454545454549206,0.0579403370016592,0.00045454545454549206,0.02386294475318019,0.0895690882784913,0.00045454545454549206,0.00045454545454549206,0.00045454545454549206,0.00045454545454549206,0.00045454545454549206,0.04149609143192082,0.00045454545454549206,0.00045454545454549206,0.00045454545454549206,0.05595352815940816,0.00045454545454549206,0.00045454545454549206,0.00045454545454549206,0.00045454545454549206,0.00045454545454549206,0.00045454545454549206,0.00045454545454549206,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

19638,0,"This movie was so bad I do n't know whether to laugh or cry . I had high hopes for Horrorfest that year , which was also the first year I attended Horrorfest , and I have to say Horrorfest and all of its films take false advertising to a whole new level . Mad kudos to the advertisers because I 'm sure they tricked a lot of people into spending money and seeing those movies that year . The Hamiltons was easily the worst one of the ones I 've seen ( the other ones I saw were Unrest , Dark Ride , and Reincarnation ) . The movie cover and trailer made it seem like a family of cannibals terrorizing the neighborhood which I thought was a rather interesting plot , only to be disappointed at the end discovering that it was some ' coming of age ' tale about a boy 's transition into being a vampire . Which is why drama prevails over any sense of horror in this film . And to make the plot even more ridiculous , they add in a set of horny twins who ca n't wait to take a ' bite ' out of one another , and some deadly creature locked in the basement , which if I had discovered what ' it ' was had the secret not been revealed at the very end of the film , I would have left the theater halfway into the movie . Complete waste of money and time . Cut forty minutes out of this film , and make it into an episode on some show like Smallville or Charmed or Supernatural and it would have received more praise than this . Absolute rubbish ! So bad that two years later , I have to come back to IMDb and write a review about it because it still stands out in my memory as one of the worst movies I 've ever seen . Also , while you 're reading this , steer clear from the rest of the Horrorfest movies in the future . The most you could do is rent them from Blockbusters or watch it online somewhere . Horrorfest features movies from independent filmmakers who ca n't make it onto the big screen , and all the crap about ' stuff they do n't show you in theaters ' , they were n't referring to blood or guts , or horror ... they were referring to the movies themselves . Because they 're horrendous . Think of Horrorfest as a less renowned version of Sundance Film Festival , but for horror movies . Sorry for all the ' hate ' , but next time think twice before you cheat costumers out of their money .",467,0,0.00021505376344088353,0.00021505376344088353,0.00021505376344088353,0.00021505376344088353,0.00021505376344088353,0.00021505376344088353,0.00021505376344088353,0.00021505376344088353,0.03306810168533842,0.00021505376344088353,0.010532361407859465,0.010967741935481555,0.07071437160055259,0.00021505376344088353,0.00021505376344088353,0.00021505376344088353,0.00021505376344088353,0.00021505376344088353,0.010962981248324715,0.00021505376344088353,0.40890394370120825,0.00021505376344088353,0.00021505376344088353,0.03008723913972025,0.00021505376344088353,0.016308124484612975,0.024989731013088413,0.00021505376344088353,0.00021505376344088353,0.00021505376344088353,0.00021505376344088353,0.00021505376344088353,0.00021505376344088353,0.00021505376344088353,0.00021505376344088353,0.017041507126529572,0.021125689237528656,0.00021505376344088353,0.00021505376344088353,0.10847048058142685,0.019269749788696132,0.00021505376344088353,0.00021505376344088353,0.17407921354983105,0.03595188177937029,0.00021505376344088353,0.00021505376344088353,0.00021505376344088353,0.00021505376344088353,0.00021505376344088353,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0
19716,0,"If you are having a bad day , or bad week . If you are looking for a film that will make you laugh and forget about your troubles . I do n't think Role Models is that movie for you . The film centers around Danny(Paul Rudd ) and Wheeler(Seann William Scott ) Two juice promoters , who go to schools promoting the product , telling kids to stay off drugs , and more juice . But Danny is having the worst week ever , and crashes his company car , with Wheeler in the seat next to him . His soon to be ex girlfriend Beth(Elizabeth Banks ) who is a lawyer , manages to avoid getting them jail time , by doing hours of community service , volunteering at a big brother place called Sturdy Wings led by Gayle(Jane Lynch ) . Wheeler is assigned to Ronnie(Bobb'e J Thompson ) who is 10 years old , and has a foul mouth like he 's Chris Rock . Danny is assigned to Augie(McLovins , Christopher Mintz - Plasse ) who likes to dress like a knight , and fight like he is in medieval times . But will this be good for Danny and Wheeler , or will they be better off in jail?Okay I 'm not gon na beat around the bush , this movie was very unpleasant in many ways . Namely the Ronnie character , hearing those bad words coming out of a kid that young , was very shocking . If he was a little bit older , it would not have mater'd as much . I mean what where his parents thinking , when they sign'd him on to this . Elizabeth Banks character is so unwatchable , maybe I was supposed to feel bad for her character , but I felt nothing , because she is annoyingly predictably portrayed as a female who would be played in these types of comedies . And Jane Lynch , who 's the worst of the worst . She delivers the most overacting performance ever . Playing a former drug addict , who acts like she still is on drugs . Listening to her give all that annoying dialog , made me want to throw my head up against the wall . Seann William Scott once again playing another Stifler like character , he should really try to separate himself , and this film wo n't do it . And the more Scott tries to hard to be funny , is what keeps him from being funny . Now Paul Rudd on the other hand , I 'm gon na separate from the others in the film , cause he manages to deliver a solid performance , although he does not get higher laughs , but he is the most interesting character from the rest . Cause Rudd does not overact , and does not try so hard . The scenes with him and Mintz - Plasse are watchable . But the rest of the film is so stupid , it picks up at times . But it becomes so predictable and uninteresting . It is a reminder that these types of comedies try nothing new , there all the same , they take no chances . Role Models is an example of that .",559,0,0.00021276595744682512,0.06075845010017623,0.00021276595744682512,0.1211420969619625,0.00021276595744682512,0.022647314796792297,0.00021276595744682512,0.00021276595744682512,0.00021276595744682512,0.00021276595744682512,0.01237424562942898,0.00021276595744682512,0.00021276595744682512,0.00021276595744682512,0.00021276595744682512,0.00021276595744682512,0.1137059275180889,0.00021276595744682512,0.00021276595744682512,0.014123719575959438,0.45693025885328564,0.00021276595744682512,0.00021276595744682512,0.00021276595744682512,0.00021276595744682512,0.00021276595744682512,0.00021276595744682512,0.00021276595744682512,0.00021276595744682512,0.00021276595744682512,0.00021276595744682512,0.00021276595744682512,0.00021276595744682512,0.00021276595744682512,0.00021276595744682512,0.00021276595744682512,0.00021276595744682512,0.00021276595744682512,0.00021276595744682512,0.00021276595744682512,0.013123808623834077,0.00021276595744682512,0.00021276595744682512,0.13592698777649914,0.00021276595744682512,0.04075655186609979,0.00021276595744682512,0.00021276595744682512,0.00021276595744682512,0.00021276595744682512,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0

20302,0,"I just have to add , in case anyone actually reads this and has n't completely gotten the point yet . These other reviewers are n't joking around , this really IS the worst colour movie you 're likely to ever see . When the movie started I could n't believe something like this actually made it out for the world to see . They're not just saying it when they said it looks like a home movie . It really does . Like the "" director "" took the family hi8 camcorder ( before DV cameras and computer non - linear editing ) , no other equipment ( lights , sound gear , etc ) , grabbed some decent - looking acting students , and went out to shoot a movie . No script , just making it up as he went along . When I watched it , it was on my mono TV , so I only have one channel of audio ( left of right speaker ) . At first I thought I 'd hooked it up wrong . The movie was silent until someone spoke a couple of minutes in . I got up and switched over to the other channel and suddenly I could hear music and sound effects but then could n't hear the dialog . They recorded the sound on different bloody channels ! I mean , there 's movies that can be funny to watch , so bad they 're good , kind of thing . I 'm not sure this is one of those . I mean , I 'll admit to being a bit of a budding film maker . And seeing bad movies just makes you want to go out there and PROVE you can do it better , you know . But watching this just made me feel sorry for whoever made it . As bad as they were , the actors are the only good thing about this . I thought the chick was hot and was disappointed in the brevity of her bath scene . A bit of T and A from her would have raised the score from nothing to maybe a 3 or 4 . But alas , no . If you want to make a movie but it 's turning out crap , throw in some gratuitous nudity .

20541,0,"The original Thunderbirds earned a place in TV history . It was , and still is , much beloved - indeed , the entire first 10 minutes of the Wallace and Gromit movie ( the Wererabbit ) is a direct lift of Thunderbirds , down to a direct replay of the original Thunderbird 2 launching sequence ( if you do n't believe me , get the movie , and then get a copy of the original episode where Thunderbird 2 is launched).This movie was a crass attempt at making a kids ' movie - when the original was loved and enjoyed by kids and adults alike ! In the original , the Thunderbirds spent all of their time rescuing people who were often trapped when Mother Nature or Technology went horrible wrong ( yes , there was also the occasional criminal act ) . The Thunderbirds put their own lives and resources at risk for no reward - the very essence of heroism and selflessness . There was little physical violence . The Thunderbirds challenged the imagination to a degree - how many of us would dream of someday building a Thunderbird 2 ? And do n't underestimate the power of entertainment to do this - many Japanese attribute their fascination with humanoid robots to the old Astroboy cartoon . But this movie was a poor re - image of the original . This movie came across as a meld between Thunderbirds and Loony Tunes - I mean , we have Anthony Edwards as Brain imitating Porky Pig 's stuttering ? ? ? ? ? Much of the action consists of Kung Fu / Power Rangers type fighting . Indeed , there were funny sound effects when someone got nailed on the head with a frying pan . The tech that fired our imagination was absent - instead we have these kids running around , using a plot device that was NEVER in the original series ( having the entire team take off at once , leaving the base occupied by the kids and Brain ) . Then there was a dose of "" Use the Force Luke "" mysticism thrown in when TinTin would levitate something or another , coupled with the The Hood using aerodynamics that looked like they were lifted from "" Crouching Tiger , Hidden Dragon "" . About the only thing missing was for The Hood to go "" TinTin , I am your Uncle "" with a breath mask voice . The heart that made Thunderbirds unique was GONE.The only bright point was Ron Cook 's portrayal of Parker - he caught it perfectly . But the actress playing Lady Penelope came across as a child - HUH ? ? ? ? And this is why we hate this movie . When someone puts out something that was popular to a fan base , and expects the fans to shell out money to watch , and then delivers something than was n't even close to what the fans expect - well , I am sorry , that is just plain WRONG ! OK , so if they were making a kids ' movie - fine - next time distribute it straight to video , where many of these belong . But do n't package something up in a familiar wrapper and change the innards .",561,0,0.00022222222222224893,0.00022222222222224893,0.00022222222222224893,0.00022222222222224893,0.00022222222222224893,0.09473169342787884,0.011333594390423574,0.00022222222222224893,0.00022222222222224893,0.00022222222222224893,0.00022222222222224893,0.00022222222222224893,0.00022222222222224893,0.00022222222222224893,0.011333333280870881,0.00022222222222224893,0.00022222222222224893,0.00022222222222224893,0.011331548078400252,0.00022222222222224893,0.4452404184914683,0.00022222222222224893,0.00022222222222224893,0.09106214336140948,0.00022222222222224893,0.00022222222222224893,0.00022222222222224893,0.00022222222222224893,0.014971588692394283,0.00022222222222224893,0.00022222222222224893,0.012761280494931394,0.00022222222222224893,0.00022222222222224893,0.03172441463804169,0.010126331846895513,0.00022222222222224893,0.00022222222222224893,0.09854942922923249,0.02066606585200742,0.00022222222222224893,0.04450215044637974,0.00022222222222224893,0.00022222222222224893,0.00022222222222224893,0.018876555273685397,0.07501167471820211,0.00022222222222224893,0.00022222222222224893,0.00022222222222224893,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0

20846,0,"A couple move into their dream home , unaware that it and its neighbours have been built over land formerly used as a cemetery . The film is said to have been based on a true story , although how much of it is supposed to be true is not disclosed . The plot is hardly unique - see Spielberg 's ' Poltergeist ' ( 1982 ) . Within a short time , they experience various supernatural phenomena : these range from the disturbing - mysterious shadows , the serious illness of the daughter - to the frankly ridiculous - toilets continually flushing and garage doors going out of control . There is little depth to the story : once it has become established that the land had been used as a cemetery , we do not learn anything more . The plot does not seem to develop . The characters are not particularly well drawn or in any way memorable , nor is the atmosphere particularly special . The film could be disturbing to some viewers .

21319,0,"This movie is pretty awful but I have some interesting information about it : It was filmed in 1976 at Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff , AZ , as well as at Oak Creek Canyon near Sedona , AZ . A good bulk of the extras in the film are then - drama students from NAU . I was a freshman there that year , minoring in theatre , but for some reason I did n't get involved with the production . I did however know several people who did and can supply this rather odd fact : There is a scene in this movie where two of the principals , as part of their hazing ritual , have to run naked into the woods . They are seen from behind in the movie , doing just that . The thing is , those are n't the actors at all but two guys I knew from the theatre department .

21422,0,"This film was a critical and box - office fiasco back in 1957 . It was based on a novel which was later turned into a play -- which flopped on Broadway . The story is about some navy officers on leave in San Francisco during WWII . They have 4 day 's leave which they spend at the Mark Hopkins hotel . The film meanders a lot and none of the characters seem very real . Cary Grant is generally brilliant in comedy and drama -- but here he plays a sort of wheeler dealer and he does n't really pull it off . Tony Curtis or James Garner would have been better choices . Audrey Hepburn was initially set to play opposite Grant , but had other commitments -- so Suzy parker stepped in . She had never acted before , but was America 's top photographic model at the time . I think that she did a good job , considering all the pressure that she was under . Grant 's pairing with Jayne Mansfield in a few brief scenes -- did not really work . The Studio was trying to give her some class by acting with Grant -- but the character had no substance at all .",212,0,0.0005263157894737358,0.0005263157894737358,0.0005263157894737358,0.02901718299588556,0.0005263157894737358,0.0005263157894737358,0.0005263157894737358,0.0005263157894737358,0.06833035109319706,0.0005263157894737358,0.0005263157894737358,0.0005263157894737358,0.19873856141258267,0.0005263157894737358,0.0005263157894737358,0.0005263157894737358,0.045436703468094336,0.0005263157894737358,0.0005263157894737358,0.0005263157894737358,0.0940315215195712,0.11494027421809266,0.0005263157894737358,0.0005263157894737358,0.0005263157894737358,0.023985355116358898,0.06605051344103884,0.0005263157894737358,0.0005263157894737358,0.03410905876036132,0.0005263157894737358,0.0005263157894737358,0.0005263157894737358,0.0005263157894737358,0.0005263157894737358,0.0005263157894737358,0.04710709922396216,0.0005263157894737358,0.0005263157894737358,0.0005263157894737358,0.0005263157894737358,0.0005263157894737358,0.0005263157894737358,0.2577270629613796,0.0005263157894737358,0.0005263157894737358,0.0005263157894737358,0.0005263157894737358,0.0005263157894737358,0.0005263157894737358,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

21685,0,"54 is a film about a club with that very title in the setting of the 70s era . It features the classic good - looking bartender . The sexy females . The high powered owner . The partying . When all entwined together chaos ensues , and the bartender ( played by Phillipe ) seems to be at the brunt of it all . I'm going to be as blunt and honest as possible , whilst avoiding any outright unfair or untrue comments ( like , it 's an ' ok ' film ) . I really do find it a completely dire film complimented by it 's dire cast . Every time I sit down to watch a film casting Salma Hayek , I am always awaiting to see her beauty , radiantly expressed simultaneously with a great performance , but , reality invariably reminds me quite abruptly how utterly talentless she is . I mean , really , what has she ever bequeathed the masses with , other than her immense table dance in ' From Dusk Till Dawn ' ... ? The same goes for Ryan Phillippe , another poor actor who gives nothing to the screen but his good looks and insanely dull facade otherwise known as ' acting ' . Mike Myers , is n't quite as bad as these 2 , he does at least give the Film something worthy . Playing the seedy , extroverted co - founder of the 54 Club . The type that the majority watching would hate ( i.e. job well done ) , he puts in a somewhat convincing performance that gave me rare enjoyment from the flick . But alas , it is not enough to rescue the film from it 's baseless and flat nothingness . Most ' bad ' bad films I find something to take from the film , but this has nothing to it , really . Neve Campbell is n't too bad , but she is just ' there ' . The storyline is dull , it appears the writer was more bent on making a film of this style and embellishment and forgot to add anything else . Any meaning . Any class . Anything at all . Because like most ornaments , they are just hollow pointless objects , that are merely pretty to look at , much akin to the basis of this disastrous film . Genuinely an hour and a half of time I could have spent better doing something much more exciting , like talking to 90 year old relatives on the phone about the weather .",441,0,0.00028169014084509554,0.00028169014084509554,0.07267964644149855,0.00028169014084509554,0.00028169014084509554,0.00028169014084509554,0.00028169014084509554,0.00028169014084509554,0.00028169014084509554,0.00028169014084509554,0.00028169014084509554,0.00028169014084509554,0.00028169014084509554,0.00028169014084509554,0.014364055732120259,0.00028169014084509554,0.12545398283888887,0.00028169014084509554,0.00028169014084509554,0.00028169014084509554,0.00028169014084509554,0.174772202239394,0.00028169014084509554,0.02535587831307308,0.00028169014084509554,0.00028169014084509554,0.06566340179816924,0.00028169014084509554,0.00028169014084509554,0.038523895320380655,0.00028169014084509554,0.00028169014084509554,0.02789720177198357,0.00028169014084509554,0.00028169014084509554,0.00028169014084509554,0.00028169014084509554,0.00028169014084509554,0.00028169014084509554,0.00028169014084509554,0.00028169014084509554,0.00028169014084509554,0.00028169014084509554,0.44374043976984306,0.00028169014084509554,0.00028169014084509554,0.00028169014084509554,0.00028169014084509554,0.00028169014084509554,0.00028169014084509554,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
21916,0,"The movie remains in the gray for far too long . Very little gets explained as the movie progresses , with as a result lots of weird sequences that seem to have a deeper meaning but because of the way of storytelling they become only just weird and not understandable to watch . It sort of forces you to watch the movie again but no way I 'm going to do that . It is that I watched this movie in the morning , I 'm sure of it that if I watched this movie in the evening I would had fallen asleep . To me the movie was like a poor man 's "" Blade Runner"" . The movie leaves far too many questions and improbabilities . It makes the movie leave a pointless and non - lasting impression . Also the weird look of the movie does n't help much . The movie is halve CGI / halve real life but it 's not done halve as good , impressive , spectacular and imaginative as for instance would be the case in later movies such as "" Sin City "" and "" 300 "" . They even created halve of the characters of the movie by computer , which seemed like a very pointless- and odd choice , also considering that the character animation is n't too impressive looking . Sure the futuristic environment is still good looking and the movie obviously was n't cheap to make but its style over substance and in this case that really is n't a positive thing to say . Some of the lines are also absolutely horrendous and uninteresting . The main God of the movie constantly says lines such as ; ' I 'm going to do this but it 's none of your concern why I want to do it ' . Than just do n't say anything at all Mr. Horus ! It 's irritating and a really easy thing to put in movie , if you do n't care to explain anything about the plot . Also the deeper questions and meanings of the movie gets muddled in the drivel of the movie and its script . The actors still did their very best . They seemed like they believed in the project and were sure of it that what they were making would be something special . So I ca n't say anything negative about them . The story and movie is far from original . It rip - offs from a lot of classic and semi - classic , mostly modern , science - fiction movies . It perhaps is also the reason why the movie made a very redundant impression on me .

22007,0,"Truly one of the most dire films I 've ever sat through . I 've never actually taken the time to write one of these but felt compelled to after witnessing this affront to film - making and feel somewhat aggrieved to be wasting my time on such a piece of turd to be honest . There were so many parts that infuriated me with their complete randomness and lack of sense ( e.g. when would the police force ever shoot people with infectious diseases ? When would hospitals ever through out such people for lack of a cure ? Why was the guy who spotted him spying on his wife wandering around outside in his dressing gown whilst carrying a gun as she rolled around on the bed ? ) . Also , the characterisation - as we 've almost come to expect in such films - was awful ( e.g. the way the blonde guy - I do n't remember his frickin name and do n't give a toss anyway - completely turned against his girlfriend and ran off to leave her ) and I ended up wanting them all to meet grisly ends !

22081,0,"I do n't know what the rest of you guys watch Steven Seagal movies for , but I watch them because , as silly as they are , they 're at least always good for a laugh . Why would you rate this movie a 1 out of 10 based on the dubbing , when that kind of thing is exactly what makes a movie like this into a cult favorite that you can laugh at the silliness of?Attack Force is by no means a great movie , but I felt it was as worthy a Steven Seagal vehicle as many of his other movies ; in fact I did n't think it was one of his worst by a long - shot . It had , most of the time , a half - way coherent plot line , and it was , most of the time , fundamentally exciting . The ending really sucked , but even that had some enjoyably trashy elements . In the end the story itself did not deliver what it promised , but I actually thought that the acting , characterization ( if I may use such a big word ) and the rest of the production values delivered exactly what a true Steven Seagal fan would expect . Seagal himself in particular was exactly the stone - faced , no - nonsense man 's man that we 've come to expect , and the rest of the cast backed him up pretty well , without ever up - staging him . This , people , is what a Steven Seagal movie does . Deal with it .

It is beyond boring , most of the scenes are filmed in front of a green screen , the acting is somewhat improvised , almost as if they did n't have a script . The Martians are CGI , which look like they were done by a novice , or a Fan produced movie . I can not stress just how bad this DVD really is!Example : In one of the scenes , the martians are torturing a local female captive . She goes from a woman in front of a green screen , to a CGI copy of that woman . The change is totally noticeable , and when she is killed , you can see that it is a computer figure , looking like something from a game back in 1990!If at all possible , avoid this movie like the plague !

22474,0,"I am commenting on this miniseries from the perspective of someone who read the novel first . And from that perspective I can honestly say that while enjoyable , I can see why it has n't been rebroadcast anytime recently . More specifically , this mini has some serious problems , such as:1 ) It is terribly miscast . The actors who played the younger generation were all 15 to 20 years older than the characters . Ali McGraw ( 45 at the time ) was playing Natalie Jastrow who was supposed to be about 26 . Jan - Michael Vincent ( 39 at the time ) was playing Byron Henry who was supposed to be about 22 . The other Henry children , and Pamela Tudsbury , were also played by actors way too old for characters who were supposed to be in their 20's.2 ) Some of the acting was absolutely awful . Ali McGraw at times almost made this mini unwatchable . I have seen more convincing performances in high school plays . 3 ) The directing was poor . To be fair to Ali McGraw , the bad acting and character development were probably the directing . The portrayal of Hitler was way overdone . His character came off looking and behaving more like a cartoon villain than the charismatic , sometimes charming , but always diabolical genius Herman Wouk painted him as in the novel . Some of the other characters are done so stereotypically ( Berel Jastrow ) they do not gain the depth of character that Wouk created for them.4 ) This mini is very dated . The hokey music , the pretentious narration ( it sounded like a junior high school history film narration ) , and the entire prime - time soap opera feel of the mini made it almost comical at times . Also , too often Byron and Natalie are costumed and made up to look like they are in 1979 rather than 1939.Someone who watches this without the benefit of reading the novel first will probably not sit through it all , because it will come off more as a late 70 's / early 80 's "" take myself too seriously "" prime - time soap drama , rather than the television version of what is certainly a modern American classic . Remakes of older movies and the like are sometimes poorly done , but this is probably one case where a creative and inspired director could make a very stunning , memorable , and critically acclaimed production . I do n't ever see that happening since a remake would have to be just as long ( 15 hours ) or longer to do it right , and given the short attention span of most of the current American viewing public , it would n't fly .",480,0,0.00023809523809525978,0.00023809523809525978,0.00023809523809525978,0.01266297896201225,0.00023809523809525978,0.00023809523809525978,0.00023809523809525978,0.00023809523809525978,0.023384969749237514,0.00023809523809525978,0.00023809523809525978,0.00023809523809525978,0.00023809523809525978,0.00023809523809525978,0.00023809523809525978,0.00023809523809525978,0.00023809523809525978,0.00023809523809525978,0.024047619047619845,0.00023809523809525978,0.407977149730633,0.00023809523809525978,0.00023809523809525978,0.00023809523809525978,0.00023809523809525978,0.0651945308625553,0.00023809523809525978,0.00023809523809525978,0.00023809523809525978,0.00023809523809525978,0.00023809523809525978,0.03596121697703494,0.00023809523809525978,0.00023809523809525978,0.016885095501053278,0.00023809523809525978,0.12297100931335808,0.00023809523809525978,0.00023809523809525978,0.00023809523809525978,0.05674200827688114,0.00023809523809525978,0.015389562929488496,0.20949814436441097,0.00023809523809525978,0.00023809523809525978,0.00023809523809525978,0.00023809523809525978,0.00023809523809525978,0.00023809523809525978,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
22643,0,"as an inspiring director myself , this movie was exciting to watch with criticism in mind . Shot with low end digital camera probably with 35 mm adapter for DOF . The editing is good acting decent , sound effects are n't too over the top . I would have give it a 7 for an indie film , but the story are n't that interesting . It 's more on the drama side , character developments than a horror flick . It 's not for those who wants to get spooked startled frightened grossed out , or sit down with popcorn to just enjoy.honestly this movie would be good if we were still in the 50'sThis movie is about a family who has a dry field , and that is just that .",134,0,0.0006896551724138444,0.0006896551724138444,0.0006896551724138444,0.0006896551724138444,0.0006896551724138444,0.0006896551724138444,0.03517241379310317,0.0006896551724138444,0.0006896551724138444,0.0006896551724138444,0.0006896551724138444,0.0006896551724138444,0.0006896551724138444,0.0006896551724138444,0.0006896551724138444,0.0006896551724138444,0.0006896551724138444,0.0006896551724138444,0.0006896551724138444,0.0006896551724138444,0.2766357155493693,0.2492359026742084,0.0006896551724138444,0.0006896551724138444,0.0006896551724138444,0.0006896551724138444,0.0006896551724138444,0.0006896551724138444,0.056721879155366785,0.027693148924647224,0.0006896551724138444,0.0006896551724138444,0.0006896551724138444,0.0006896551724138444,0.039371268389948776,0.0006896551724138444,0.0006896551724138444,0.0006896551724138444,0.0006896551724138444,0.0006896551724138444,0.0006896551724138444,0.0006896551724138444,0.0006896551724138444,0.2855144990995612,0.0006896551724138444,0.0006896551724138444,0.0006896551724138444,0.0006896551724138444,0.0006896551724138444,0.0006896551724138444,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

The Monster Jigsaw is a mish mash of all these dysfunctional students ideas , u just know ur in for trouble when someone equips him with a buzzsaw and a sawed of shotgun , the film was n't as gory as we hoped , i mean on of the deaths is a heart attack . Again i think the acting sucks , sum of the actors must be porn stars and one get into her undies for what ever reason . The absolute worst part is the ending , it leaves it open for a bit of a Jigsaw 2 but that s never gunna happen lets face it .

22962,0,"I sought out a copy of The Forest because I was watching a VH1 special , I think "" Where Are They Now "" , and saw the video box flash across the screen during a segment on the actor Corky Pigeon . He played the male child ghost in this B horror horrible , but I remember him from his character Freddy on the Silver Spoons television show . This flick 's a major letdown . There 's nothing here . It actually took me four months to watch it from start to finish . I kept stopping it in boredom , setting it aside and forgetting about it , then stumbling on it and trying once again to get through it . Obviously , the angle of this film that was intended to set it apart from its counterparts was the supernatural element , the apparitions . And obviously , here , that does n't work . I ca n't stand the male leads . I kept expecting them to look down at their palms during the longer dialogue scenes in order to read cheat lines . The situation at the beginning where the couples decide to go camping separately is awkward and plain dumb . I guess the only positive thing to say about this one is the scene where the guy falls and breaks his leg , you can see the bone sticking out of his flesh . It 's fairly good gore makeup there . Man , I 'm really reaching for a positive now , huh . The only other no - budget horror film on a level as bad as this one would be Home Sweet Home .",285,0,0.000377358490566087,0.000377358490566087,0.000377358490566087,0.000377358490566087,0.000377358490566087,0.000377358490566087,0.019464447569968357,0.000377358490566087,0.000377358490566087,0.000377358490566087,0.000377358490566087,0.000377358490566087,0.19699682711872749,0.000377358490566087,0.000377358490566087,0.000377358490566087,0.02947596392286222,0.000377358490566087,0.000377358490566087,0.000377358490566087,0.26014445835329086,0.000377358490566087,0.000377358490566087,0.000377358490566087,0.000377358490566087,0.000377358490566087,0.12744924256124632,0.000377358490566087,0.000377358490566087,0.000377358490566087,0.000377358490566087,0.000377358490566087,0.000377358490566087,0.000377358490566087,0.000377358490566087,0.000377358490566087,0.000377358490566087,0.000377358490566087,0.000377358490566087,0.000377358490566087,0.000377358490566087,0.02367548545279811,0.03420825913441479,0.25633794163364154,0.000377358490566087,0.036775676139840605,0.000377358490566087,0.000377358490566087,0.000377358490566087,0.000377358490566087,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0

23244,0,"I just watched this film 15 minutes ago , and I still have no idea what I just watched . Mainly I think it 's a film about an internet S&M "" star "" of CD Roms that are about as realistic as flash cartoons online . She 's murdered by someone , which causes her sister and a crack team of 2 FBI agents to investigate the death . The local homicide division of Big City , USA is also investigating , though most of his work comes by the way of oogling the CD ROMs which he claims are as realistic "" as the real thing "" . I know . Wow . Michael Madsen is the only one in the film that has any kind of credits behind him . He 's in the film for about 15 minutes , and half of that is him banging the main girl for seemingly no apparent reason . I wo n't even explain the ending , because quite frankly I ca n't make it out myself . But before the final scene , we 're treated to a 3 or 4 minute montage of everything in the film . Honestly , they could have ran that then the final scene and it would have been the same effect with the cross eyed direction and all . All in all , stay away from this film .

23387,0,"Okay , what the hell kind of TRASH have I been watching now ? "" The Witches ' Mountain "" has got to be one of the most incoherent and insane Spanish exploitation flicks ever and yet , at the same time , it 's also strangely compelling . There 's absolutely nothing that makes sense here and I even doubt there ever was a script to work with , but somehow I could n't turn it off . The scratching your head with confusion starts right away , with an opening sequence about an angry little girl that killed her mother 's cat . So you think this film revolves on children possessed by evil forces ? Heck no , because after this intro , the girl and her wickedness simply are n't mentioned anymore . Then cut to a guy , with the most impressively trimmed mustache you 'll ever see , who breaks up with his girlfriend in a rather unsubtle way . When she asks him to spend his vacation with her , he promptly phones his employer requesting him any type of assignment ! Great move . The movie finally starts now , as he travels to an isolated mountain area to photograph some peaks . Though not before he picks up a new girl ( Patty Shepard ) and photographs her topless ! Throughout their journey , all kind of strange events occur that  you guessed it  are never explained . The girl wakes up in the middle of the forest , loud petrifying music plays everywhere and someone even steals the jeep ! Really , car jacking witches ? Apparently a coven of silent witches owns the mountains and they practice voodoo on trespassers . That 's as close as I get describing the plot , but there 's a good chance I 'm way off More important here is the atmosphere ! "" The Witches ' Mountain "" is occasionally very creepy , with its spooky music and interesting cinematography . The supportive characters all look uncanny and the ravishing Patty Shepard plays a good heroine .

23959,0,"The fact that most of the budget for this presumably went on the heavy - duty cast list should n't have mattered if it had been staged with flair and imagination and some sympathy for the original 's satirical intent . Instead we get risibly bad song and dance sequences featuring picturesque beggars and whores , and the final alienation is accomplished by pulling back to reveal the action has taken place on a music - hall stage , appropriately enough for a production that 's more Lionel ' Oliver ' Blair than Brecht . The acting talent is shamefully misused : Migenes and Walters are good but do n't have to try very hard : Migenes at least has a great voice and some feel for the material . Julia looks perfect as Mack , but struggles with the character , straitjacketed by a fake plummy accent . Harris 's Peachum is embarrassingly mannered and Polly is atrocious . The adaptations of lyrics , script and music are often awkward : it was a bad move to base the film on Marc Blitzstein 's bowdlerised Broadway version , but at least his words were singable , unlike most of what 's been interpolated in gestures of faithfulness . And the attempt at overcoming the low budget by filming at claustrophobic angles on mist - shrouded sets lit in garish blues and oranges as if by some bargain - basement Vittorio Storaro fails utterly -- the film just looks cheap , shoddy and thoughtlessly made . Disgraceful .",258,0,0.0005555555555556102,0.02718845707204069,0.0005555555555556102,0.0005555555555556102,0.0005555555555556102,0.0005555555555556102,0.0005555555555556102,0.0005555555555556102,0.17392803137821933,0.0005555555555556102,0.0005555555555556102,0.0005555555555556102,0.0005555555555556102,0.0005555555555556102,0.0005555555555556102,0.0005555555555556102,0.0005555555555556102,0.0005555555555556102,0.0005555555555556102,0.0005555555555556102,0.0005555555555556102,0.17111041518435993,0.0005555555555556102,0.0005555555555556102,0.0005555555555556102,0.0005555555555556102,0.0005555555555556102,0.0005555555555556102,0.05795611186657301,0.0005555555555556102,0.0005555555555556102,0.0005555555555556102,0.24852071207260787,0.0005555555555556102,0.0005555555555556102,0.0005555555555556102,0.0005555555555556102,0.0005555555555556102,0.03311924770098703,0.0005555555555556102,0.0005555555555556102,0.0005555555555556102,0.0005555555555556102,0.2642881358363208,0.0005555555555556102,0.0005555555555556102,0.0005555555555556102,0.0005555555555556102,0.0005555555555556102,0.0005555555555556102,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

Everything from the tacky , and I DO mean tacky score to the really bad acting , I dare anyone to watch this and not be bored out of their minds . I mean parts 1 to 3 kept the vibe strong on the plot of Damion , but without him around in this one it 's just not the same . Sure by the end of part 3 I was getting a little tired of the continued story line 's , but it was a good closure at the end of the third one . Again there was no reason for a part 4 .

24411,0,"Film critics of the world , I apologize . It is your job to give advice to the moviegoing public so that they can wisely choose what to spend money on . But I ignored your advice and I have been deeply hurt . However , my decision to see "" The Cat in the Hat "" was n't made haphazardly . You see , three years ago all of you critics said that we should all avoid the "" calamity "" known as "" How the Grinch Stole Christmas "" . Then some friends of mine took me to see it and it turned out to be a colorful , funny and almost hypnotic yuletide treat . So when the critics unleashed their fury against "" The Cat in the Hat "" , another big budget Seuss update with a big name star in the title role , I thought that it must be the same old song . How wrong I was . For five whole minutes I thought I was in the clear . The opening credits are clever , the kids are charming and the production values are top notch . Then the cat showed up . There are many problems from this point on , but the biggest one was the woeful miscasting of Mike Myers . Where "" The Grinch "" was saved by the inspired casting of Jim Carrey , "" The Cat "" was destroyed by Myers . He can be very funny when his energies are applied where they belong , comic sketches . Every movie he 's made that was truly funny was really just a feature length comedy sketch , from "" Wayne 's World "" to "" Austin Powers "" . So he tries to do the same thing here , it 's just that these comedy sketches are more like the stuff that they stick at the end of SNL , not funny , just painful . Not that the writers helped him out any . After the charming prologue the movie turns into an hour of repulsive bodily humor gags , poorly timed pratfalls and insultingly stunted attempts at hip humor . This movie was the most disheartening cinematic experience I have ever had . Period . So much talent and work went into something so vile . I know that the adult stars of this movie will be relatively unscathed by this mess , I just hope that the wonderful Spencer Breslin and Dakota Fanning will get more chances to show their charms in far better movies . If you are a parent , please avoid this like the plague . With movies like "" Elf "" and "" Brother Bear "" currently in theaters , you have far better choices .",467,0,0.09866668646983132,0.00029411764705884806,0.00029411764705884806,0.00029411764705884806,0.00029411764705884806,0.03990818226313186,0.00029411764705884806,0.00029411764705884806,0.00029411764705884806,0.00029411764705884806,0.00029411764705884806,0.016085840110615215,0.00029411764705884806,0.00029411764705884806,0.00029411764705884806,0.00029411764705884806,0.00029411764705884806,0.00029411764705884806,0.014997867536901535,0.00029411764705884806,0.5320726837509765,0.00029411764705884806,0.00029411764705884806,0.00029411764705884806,0.00029411764705884806,0.00029411764705884806,0.00029411764705884806,0.00029411764705884806,0.00029411764705884806,0.025484034681293857,0.00029411764705884806,0.00029411764705884806,0.0732310710033354,0.00029411764705884806,0.00029411764705884806,0.00029411764705884806,0.00029411764705884806,0.00029411764705884806,0.00029411764705884806,0.024085917544573208,0.031190306625259352,0.00029411764705884806,0.00029411764705884806,0.00029411764705884806,0.13251270413172794,0.00029411764705884806,0.00029411764705884806,0.00029411764705884806,0.00029411764705884806,0.00029411764705884806,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

In movie we can see privates , armed with "" M1 Garand "" ( invented in year 1932 ! ) , not authentic "" 1903 Springfield "" ( aka "" Silent Death "" ) , who privates use until WWII . Difference - M1 can load 1,5 times more ammunition and 3 times more fire rate ! M1 was semi - automatic , Springfield requires reloading after every shot . Little difference ? ! 2 ) German army uniforms has borrowed from 1940 Year too . Especially - helmets . German helmets until end of WWI have significant pike on top , we can not see even one in movie . And if we make little additional search in archives - how much truthful is this "" True Story "" ?

24624,0,"I usually read reviews before I watch a movie . Guess what , I did n't do that before watching TLB , and I have to say I was very surprised to see the above average rating at IMDb . I found it to have a total lack of story . You just get dropped into it ( and , sadly , not in the way Saving Private Ryan dropped us into the movie ) , and it also has a sudden end , which was very unsatisfying for me . I have to admit , the wounded soldiers looked pretty realistic to me , especially with the low budget in mind . But prepare yourself to have a laugh ... Some guys are being tossed through the air after an explosion as if they are Olympic gymnasts . A mid - air corkscrew or somersault during WW I is a bit too much for me , especially when it 's performed countless times during the movie ... But the parts that really got me laughing until I almost cried were the scenes containing close combat . The screaming and shouting German voices ... unbelievably funny . It seems as if they are spoken by one single actor / voice performer , because they all sound exactly the same , and it just sounds like a ' typical ' German voice .

24752,0,"I 'm sure that Operations Dames was a favorite at the drive - ins back in the day . There 's absolutely nothing in the way of a plot that you might miss if you were otherwise preoccupied . And if you needed to get in the mood for other activities you did have some curvaceous cuties on screen to get you in the mood . Otherwise there ai n't a whole lot that Operations Dames has going for it . It 's set in the Korean War where a platoon of GIs together with a British tommy gets a little too far forward and has to get back to the UN lines . Bad enough already , but these guys also come across a stranded bunch of USO girls and their choreographer in the same predicament . You know what 's sad about this film is that it took women generations to finally get accepted in the Army and in combat situations . These bimbos from the USO set women 's liberation back light years . In fact not even the hard bitten professional soldier who is the sergeant in charge of these men can keep it in his pants . But that was probably the better to remind some what they were at the drive - in for . This no name cast is better off with me not recognizing any of them for any individual effort . Operations Dames is definitely a team flop .",248,0,0.0005000000000000452,0.0005000000000000452,0.0005000000000000452,0.0005000000000000452,0.0005000000000000452,0.02373129911986744,0.0005000000000000452,0.16840936609135543,0.08356144520140227,0.0005000000000000452,0.0005000000000000452,0.0005000000000000452,0.0005000000000000452,0.0005000000000000452,0.0005000000000000452,0.0005000000000000452,0.05950800398948527,0.0005000000000000452,0.0005000000000000452,0.0005000000000000452,0.0005000000000000452,0.21471054358003624,0.0005000000000000452,0.0005000000000000452,0.0005000000000000452,0.12449674931254381,0.0005000000000000452,0.0005000000000000452,0.0005000000000000452,0.0005000000000000452,0.0005000000000000452,0.025500000095494697,0.05323365836334144,0.0005000000000000452,0.0005000000000000452,0.0005000000000000452,0.0005000000000000452,0.0005000000000000452,0.0005000000000000452,0.0005000000000000452,0.03179292902508596,0.050608768707409636,0.0005000000000000452,0.07433114294555832,0.07111609356841767,0.0005000000000000452,0.0005000000000000452,0.0005000000000000452,0.0005000000000000452,0.0005000000000000452,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0

25117,0,"I first saw this film two years ago in the cinema , and fell in love with this dark tale of two brooding teenage sisters coping at home in their large country house with their father and step - mother . Their relationship with their step - mother is strained to say the least , with the step - mother appearing to be increasingly becoming unstable in her battles with the younger girls . The film though slants with Oriental style ghost effects and horror , which adds a strange and unsettling aspect to the story that on first viewing is not clear , but is all the more intriguing . The direction is incredibly good , and the acting is stunning , with the step - mother in particular incredibly good swinging from one mood style to another in the film . The large house adds eeriness , and there are enough points in the film where you will jump out of your seat . This film to me clearly shows why Korean cinema is possibly the best most original in the world at the moment . You simply do n't get anything like this in the Western World , sadly , and really i can see it being influential on film makers around the world in the next decade . Highly recommended viewing in my opinion , a real joy and scare ...",235,1,0.19268083913647374,0.0004444444444444759,0.0004444444444444759,0.0004444444444444759,0.0004444444444444759,0.0004444444444444759,0.022666666715515926,0.0004444444444444759,0.027315420877991763,0.0004444444444444759,0.0004444444444444759,0.0448888888888899,0.0004444444444444759,0.0004444444444444759,0.0004444444444444759,0.0004444444444444759,0.0004444444444444759,0.0004444444444444759,0.0004444444444444759,0.04669578695831458,0.0004444444444444759,0.0004444444444444759,0.0004444444444444759,0.0004444444444444759,0.0004444444444444759,0.0004444444444444759,0.0004444444444444759,0.0004444444444444759,0.0004444444444444759,0.0004444444444444759,0.0004444444444444759,0.0004444444444444759,0.0004444444444444759,0.0004444444444444759,0.07015495556125573,0.0004444444444444759,0.0004444444444444759,0.0004444444444444759,0.07059601922266266,0.0004444444444444759,0.07808793917570522,0.11440540046455608,0.0004444444444444759,0.3147303052208554,0.0004444444444444759,0.0004444444444444759,0.0004444444444444759,0.0004444444444444759,0.0004444444444444759,0.0004444444444444759,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
25144,0,"Radio is a true story about a man who did what he felt , in his heart , was the right thing to do . The viewer will be compelled to wonder what he or she would have done . The adversity that coach Jones and Radio both faced was both tragic and predictable . People did not understand ; nor did they want to understand . But in the end , the power of circumstance forced people to understand and appreciate so much more than they did before it happened . Radio is a mentally challenged youth who understands very little , besides three of the most important things the are too often forgotten as we mature : Intuition , compassion , and love . Coach Jones is a high school teacher who can not ignore the plight of the underdog who is just trying to play a bad hand of cards in the best way that he knows how . It was sad the way coach Jones and Radio met . The practical joke that terrified the life out of Radio was enough to make you want to severely punish , not only the boys involved , but every boy who knew what was going on and did nothing about it . However , on the positive side of the scale , the incident led to a friendship that would influence so many lives in the kind of way that most of us believe only happens in the movies . This movie is a real life fairy tale and not to be missed . Ed Harris was his usual brilliance . Gooding was flawless .

I felt a little disappointed near the end so I gave it 9 out of 10 .",119,1,0.0008333333333334285,0.0008333333333334285,0.0008333333333334285,0.06373089808854794,0.0008333333333334285,0.0008333333333334285,0.0008333333333334285,0.0008333333333334285,0.0008333333333334285,0.0008333333333334285,0.0008333333333334285,0.0008333333333334285,0.0008333333333334285,0.0008333333333334285,0.0008333333333334285,0.0008333333333334285,0.0008333333333334285,0.0008333333333334285,0.0008333333333334285,0.0008333333333334285,0.0008333333333334285,0.0008333333333334285,0.0008333333333334285,0.0008333333333334285,0.0008333333333334285,0.0008333333333334285,0.0008333333333334285,0.0008333333333334285,0.0008333333333334285,0.0008333333333334285,0.0008333333333334285,0.0008333333333334285,0.0008333333333334285,0.0008333333333334285,0.1601686610603471,0.0008333333333334285,0.0008333333333334285,0.0008333333333334285,0.0008333333333334285,0.0008333333333334285,0.10639298641877615,0.0424999999999952,0.0008333333333334285,0.5897074544323293,0.0008333333333334285,0.0008333333333334285,0.0008333333333334285,0.0008333333333334285,0.0008333333333334285,0.0008333333333334285,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
25362,0,"OK , the other reviewers have pretty much covered the main points of this great little gem , i.e. the story started out in life as material for Buster Keaton 's silent classic "" 7 Chances "" . Comedy , or acting in any genre for that much , is merely interpreting a scene and lines that someone else has written and performed before , if it 's not a totally original creation . Here we have The Stooges essentially doing material that was written and performed by someone else and yet for a low budget , short time span of a film , they 're handling things just fine . Regardless of what the credits say on their films , real "" stooge - philes "" know that they had a lot of input on lines and direction . They took their work as seriously as a surgeon does a vital operation . Words spoken by Emil Sitka himself during a documentary about the boys . Here , what appears to be their usual anarchy over something so simple as getting married , is actually organized chaos . Every line is perfectly timed with a related physical action . How many comedians are around today that can claim such mastery ? Most obviously the Seinfeld crew but none others that I 've seen in the last 35 years of watching TV . The critics will always "" pooh pooh "" The Stooges or Laurel & Hardy and others but then again ... who ever remembers the critic 's names or what they said ? Simply watch , laugh and enjoy !",272,1,0.0003773584905660726,0.0003773584905660726,0.0003773584905660726,0.0003773584905660726,0.0003773584905660726,0.0003773584905660726,0.0003773584905660726,0.0003773584905660726,0.0003773584905660726,0.0003773584905660726,0.0003773584905660726,0.0003773584905660726,0.0003773584905660726,0.0003773584905660726,0.0003773584905660726,0.0003773584905660726,0.0003773584905660726,0.0003773584905660726,0.0003773584905660726,0.0003773584905660726,0.25712045719504234,0.07347687456870025,0.0003773584905660726,0.0003773584905660726,0.0003773584905660726,0.0003773584905660726,0.0003773584905660726,0.0003773584905660726,0.0003773584905660726,0.0003773584905660726,0.0003773584905660726,0.0003773584905660726,0.12046788511754712,0.0003773584905660726,0.0003773584905660726,0.0003773584905660726,0.0003773584905660726,0.0003773584905660726,0.12544332580207931,0.0003773584905660726,0.026580650344020993,0.0003773584905660726,0.0003773584905660726,0.23698570685327963,0.1436986850249892,0.0003773584905660726,0.0003773584905660726,0.0003773584905660726,0.0003773584905660726,0.0003773584905660726,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0

25408,0,"Richard Abernethie , a very wealthy man , has died and his relatives have assembled for his funeral . Included in the funeral party is Abernathie 's youngest sister Cora Galaccio . While none of the family has seen Cora in at least 20 years , they all agree that Cora was always a bit different . So when Cora says something about Abemethie having been murdered , most laugh it off as one of Cora 's eccentricities . But someone is obviously taking Cora seriously . The next day , Cora is found dead in her bed having been beaten violently . Is there a connection between the two deaths ? It 's up to Hercule Poirot to find a killer . After the Funeral is one of the most well put together episodes of the entire Poirot series . I 've always been a fan of this particular Agatha Christie book and , from what I remember , the movie is as faithful to Christie 's source material as any of the Poirot installments . The mystery is top notch with plenty of clues , suspects , and red herrings . And as I 've written before , I always enjoy an Christie story where Hercule Poirot gathers everyone together in a drawing room for the final reveal . It might be old fashioned , but that 's the way I like it . Getting beyond the plot , technically and artistically After the Funeral is a winner . Sets , editing , direction , and cinematography are as good as you 'll find in one of these movies . The acting is equally impressive . I 've come to expect an enjoyable performance from David Suchet as Poirot and he does n't disappoint here . The rest of the cast is just as strong with Monica Dolan giving an especially noteworthy performance . Other than a minor quibble with the rapid fire way the characters are introduced , I 've got no real complaints . It 's a good show all the way around .",348,1,0.00036363636363639923,0.05908504793853574,0.00036363636363639923,0.00036363636363639923,0.00036363636363639923,0.00036363636363639923,0.00036363636363639923,0.040225977413326335,0.00036363636363639923,0.00036363636363639923,0.00036363636363639923,0.00036363636363639923,0.10855249070164627,0.00036363636363639923,0.00036363636363639923,0.00036363636363639923,0.00036363636363639923,0.00036363636363639923,0.01854545454545452,0.00036363636363639923,0.4280099919297303,0.00036363636363639923,0.00036363636363639923,0.054747927968716296,0.00036363636363639923,0.00036363636363639923,0.00036363636363639923,0.00036363636363639923,0.00036363636363639923,0.00036363636363639923,0.00036363636363639923,0.00036363636363639923,0.12791081625089756,0.00036363636363639923,0.05505981705555627,0.00036363636363639923,0.03227781961442808,0.00036363636363639923,0.00036363636363639923,0.00036363636363639923,0.06103920203625239,0.00036363636363639923,0.00036363636363639923,0.00036363636363639923,0.00036363636363639923,0.00036363636363639923,0.00036363636363639923,0.00036363636363639923,0.00036363636363639923,0.00036363636363639923,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
25467,0,This is the best work i have ever seen on television . The story is compelling -- all the more so because it is true . The writers did their homework -- the accuracy of events is well documented . The acting is great . This has to be the best role Sam Waterston has ever had . And the black and white cinematography was exceptional . My only regret is that it is not available to buy . A few years ago I contacted someone involved with the production ( either with PBS or in England ) and was told they had no plans to release it on VHS ( at the time ) . This was a BBC production and ran in the U.S. on American Playhouse .

25499,0,"What looks like a ho - hum Porky 's rip - off turns out to be quite a touching film about being young and in love . The story concerns three friends , Gary , Ricky and David , who spend their after school hours looking for sex . When a new girl arrives in town Gary falls head over heels in love with her . The film goes from being a sleazy sex film to an examination of teenage insecurities . It is funny and sad at the same time . It never completely gives into that love story formula that seems prominent in every movie made . You know the guy meets girl , guy loses girl , guy gets girl back in the final frame formula . That formula is tossed aside after guy meets girl . Maybe that is why I liked the film so much . The soundtrack is especially good and the ending is a definite tear jerker . It also might be one of the most realistic endings I 've ever seen in a love story .",184,1,0.000400000000000029,0.000400000000000029,0.000400000000000029,0.023060127445637183,0.000400000000000029,0.000400000000000029,0.000400000000000029,0.000400000000000029,0.000400000000000029,0.000400000000000029,0.000400000000000029,0.000400000000000029,0.000400000000000029,0.000400000000000029,0.000400000000000029,0.000400000000000029,0.000400000000000029,0.000400000000000029,0.000400000000000029,0.000400000000000029,0.4965261385467586,0.0829866239248871,0.000400000000000029,0.000400000000000029,0.11532423075293967,0.08866465163795081,0.000400000000000029,0.000400000000000029,0.000400000000000029,0.000400000000000029,0.000400000000000029,0.000400000000000029,0.000400000000000029,0.000400000000000029,0.000400000000000029,0.000400000000000029,0.000400000000000029,0.000400000000000029,0.000400000000000029,0.000400000000000029,0.000400000000000029,0.000400000000000029,0.000400000000000029,0.17583822769182542,0.000400000000000029,0.000400000000000029,0.000400000000000029,0.000400000000000029,0.000400000000000029,0.000400000000000029,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

Not since "" Tipping the Velvet "" ( also highly recommended ) have I seen such a performance by the lead actresses , this time by Sally Hawkins and Elaine Cassidy . They acted with their souls , and this is what gets across to the audience ! The supporting actors were well chosen , too , they made a great ensemble .

25682,0,"It 's a unique film , as it gives us our only chance to see the young Noel Coward in all his ironic glory . Because he seems so reserved & detached he 's perfect for the role of an unloved cad who matter - of - factly uses all those around him . However in the deadly serious ( no pun intended ) last act , when Coward must make like the Flying Dutchman , he 's much less comfortable . But his way with an epigram is peerless , and Hecht & Macarthur have given him some gems ( Macarthur , really -- he was the wit of the pair).The film is superbly lighted by the great Lee Garmes , but has little camera movement aside from a storm sequence . Hecht and Macarthutr cared about one thing -- getting their dialogue on screen . ( NOTE : H&M themselves have blink - and - you'll - miss-'em cameos as bums in the flophouse scene).The most notable supporting player is the one and only Alexander Woolcott , notorious Broadway columnist and close friend of both Macarthur and Coward , who appears as one of the bitchy authors always kept waiting in the reception room of publisher Coward . Curious that Woolcott would agree to do a film that clearly lampoons the legendary Algonquin Round Table , of which he was a founder , and Macarthur something of an auxiliary member . The Scoundrel actually won an Oscar for best story , though that victory is probably due more to Coward 's imposing presence than any brilliance in the plot .

25960,0,"Labeling this film a "" lesbian love story "" is about as accurate as calling Pride & Prejudice a "" straight love story . "" There 's just so much more to it than that . Yes , the main character is a lesbian , but her story is classic bildungsroman , a journey from childhood to adulthood , from sexual innocence into maturity , from personal blindness to self- discovery . There is a stylistic element of camp to the film 's direction , but it is not a hindrance ; rather it serves to underscore the staged and dramatic parts of the main character 's life . Those who know Anna Chancellor from the BBC version of Pride and Prejudice will certainly be amazed with her here . Rachael Stirling is stellar as the main character Nan , and Keeley Hawes is all wide - eyed goodness as her lover Kitty Butler . Chancellor might have the stand out role , that is aside from Sally Hawkins who plays Zena Butler . This film is not for the faint of heart , but it 's not a piece of pro - gay advertising either .

26218,0,"THE FALCON AND THE SNOWMAN is a superb example of an anti-80s film . While many other films of the decade in general lacked substance , this film is pure substance . There 's nothing stylish or fake or superfluous about it . It boasts two superb performances : Timothy Hutton and Sean Penn as lifelong friends Christopher Boyce and Daulton Lee , respectively . Hutton , Penn , and Tom Cruise were a triumvirate of early 80s actors who all looked headed to much bigger and better things ( all 3 starred in TAPS ) . While Penn and Cruise 's popularity soared , Hutton has been largely forgotten about , and that 's a shame . Actually , Hutton is the first of the 3 to win an Oscar for supporting role in ORDINARY PEOPLE in 1980 , but I think his performance in this movie is even more outstanding . Hutton really captures the post - Vietnam war rebelliousness in his character Chris Boyce . A failed seminary school student , Chris has a love - hate relationship with his father , well played by the great character actor Pat Hingle . The scene where Chris quotes the poem his father thought he 'd long forgotten is a particularly powerful one . Chris gets job at Dept . of Defense and uses his hatred of U.S. gov't and its foreign policy to sell seemingly useless plans of old projects to the Soviets . He gets his buddy Daulton , a hyper drug - dealing self - server , in on it to be the courier of the project plans on microfilm . While Chris is doing it based on his beliefs , Daulton is doing it strictly for the money . The Soviet liaison is excellently played by David Suchet . Penn and Suchet have a real quirky chemistry and it 's a kind of funny set of exchanges between them . But , make no mistake , this film is anything but that . It is a serious character study about pessimism , malaise , paranoia and mistrust . Again , the leads make this film . Hutton delivers a brilliantly understated performance as Chris , a rather smart young man who had so much potential . Penn , as usual , does a tremendous characterization as Daulton , a pathetic loser who acts before he thinks , and most of the time does n't think at all . The ending of this fact - based film is very saddening on several levels . A truly powerful character study .",434,1,0.0003030303030303263,0.0003030303030303263,0.0003030303030303263,0.0003030303030303263,0.0003030303030303263,0.0003030303030303263,0.0003030303030303263,0.12381155904046146,0.0003030303030303263,0.0003030303030303263,0.0003030303030303263,0.0003030303030303263,0.0003030303030303263,0.0003030303030303263,0.0003030303030303263,0.0003030303030303263,0.0385884107662226,0.0003030303030303263,0.0003030303030303263,0.0003030303030303263,0.2587270548593545,0.0003030303030303263,0.0003030303030303263,0.0003030303030303263,0.0003030303030303263,0.051049352135488855,0.0003030303030303263,0.0003030303030303263,0.0003030303030303263,0.0003030303030303263,0.0003030303030303263,0.015498483429649663,0.0003030303030303263,0.0003030303030303263,0.0003030303030303263,0.0003030303030303263,0.0003030303030303263,0.0003030303030303263,0.0003030303030303263,0.02030164787301786,0.0003030303030303263,0.03969637670806764,0.0003030303030303263,0.43959984246046396,0.0003030303030303263,0.0003030303030303263,0.0003030303030303263,0.0003030303030303263,0.0003030303030303263,0.0003030303030303263,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
26274,0,"Those reviewers who have complained that this movie lacks plausibility or has problems of construction are missing the point . This is a wonderfully camp romance , with plenty of Play , gypsies ! Dance , gypsies ! music , that both sends up exotic love stories and celebrates them . Buttoned - up Ray Milland makes an amusing foil for a Dietrich with black hair , tattered scarves , and tons of jewelry . The character 's eagerness to feed Milland and look after him more closely resembles the good German hausfrau Dietrich was off the set than her mannered vamp roles . Censorship being in force , it 's made clear that they share a caravan on platonic terms only , with Milland fighting off Dietrich 's advances with a determination remarkable for a heterosexual bachelor who might be killed any day . His only excuse is that she smells , so perhaps a stuffy , fastidious Englishman might indeed be put off . In the small role of Milland 's young companion on his secret mission , Bruce Lester adds a note of camp of a different kind . We are told at the beginning that he hero - worships Milland , and indeed he rather fawns on him . When , after they are separated , he meets Milland , now transformed into a brown - skinned gypsy with a shirt open to the waist , his glowing appreciation of the disguise even further suggests that not only Dietrich is romantically infatuated with Milland . Despite the wonderfully improbable characters and sequence of events , the growing love of Milland for Dietrich and his acceptance of the non - rational aspects of life is rather touching .

27140,0,"I 'm seldom partial to movies about smart - assed teenagers who have problems with authority , but "" Toy Soldiers "" has grown on me with repeated viewings . This is as much a movie about Billy Tepper growing up and becoming an adult as anything else , and I give credit to Sean Astin and writer / director Daniel Petrie Jr. that they do n't make a big deal of that , but let it just unfold and sneak up on you . The camaraderie of Tepper 's friends , their grief over Joey 's death , and their joy at their survival , all are genuinely moving .

27381,0,"I 've only seen about a half dozen films starring Lino Ventura , but this one seems very much like the others . He plays a laconic criminal -- one who is short on words and subdued yet occasionally explosive . Given his quiet persona in such films as ARMY OF SHADOWS and SECOND BREATH , I 've noticed that his minimalist style of acting is extremely effective . In other words , because he is so quiet and mannered , when he does bad things you tend to notice . And , like these other films , he also has a very strong , though twisted , moral code . Abel Davos ( Ventura ) and his partner , Lilane , are both living in Italy and are career criminals . Both grew up in France and eventually had to flea due to their criminal activities . Now in Italy as the film begins , they continue to live the life of thugs and the heat is on to catch them . Oddly , instead of running to yet a third country , they decide to go back to France -- even though Davos has been tried and convicted in absentia -- and if he 's caught it could mean a life in prison or the death penalty . Much of the first third of the film concerns their covert return . Unfortunately for Davos , the return does n't go perfectly and now it seems as if every cop in France is looking for him . Additionally , the reaction of his old compatriots in crime is not at all what he 'd expect . In fact , their tepid response to his return ends up unleashing a series of terrible events towards the end of the film . Along the way , Davos meets and is taken in my a stranger , Eric Stark ( Jean - Paul Belmondo ) . Despite Davos seemingly having no friends , Stark and his lady friend try their best to make his return successful . What throws another monkey wrench into this , though , is Davos ' two very young sons -- what is Davos to do with them -- keep them with him in his hiding place ? Overall , this is a very good crime film -- sort of like French Film Noir . Unlike American Noir , the many French versions I have seen have a more realistic as well as bleak outlook to them . Fatalism reigns supreme , that 's for sure ! The acting is first - rate ( especially from Ventura and Belmondo ) , the direction very sure and the writing very nice , though I am sure many wo n't like the ending . It just seems to be tacked on -- like an afterthought . I understood why they did it this way , but can also see how it might leave many unsatisfied . As for me , it did leave me a tad flat . Otherwise , an exceptional film .",514,1,0.0002352941176470833,0.07266676648532461,0.0002352941176470833,0.0002352941176470833,0.0002352941176470833,0.0002352941176470833,0.0002352941176470833,0.09508683042617518,0.0002352941176470833,0.0002352941176470833,0.0002352941176470833,0.0002352941176470833,0.26775708499673573,0.0002352941176470833,0.02376373192579367,0.0002352941176470833,0.0002352941176470833,0.0002352941176470833,0.0002352941176470833,0.0002352941176470833,0.0002352941176470833,0.034599851820345806,0.0002352941176470833,0.028670516310209872,0.0002352941176470833,0.0002352941176470833,0.047639725289562715,0.0002352941176470833,0.0002352941176470833,0.01676159700790742,0.0002352941176470833,0.012469087776866334,0.0002352941176470833,0.0002352941176470833,0.0002352941176470833,0.0002352941176470833,0.0002352941176470833,0.0002352941176470833,0.0002352941176470833,0.0002352941176470833,0.0002352941176470833,0.0002352941176470833,0.0002352941176470833,0.3911730432551956,0.0002352941176470833,0.0002352941176470833,0.0002352941176470833,0.0002352941176470833,0.0002352941176470833,0.0002352941176470833,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

Brooks ( Terms of Endearment , As Good as It Gets ) this is a really good satirical comedy film showing behind the scenes in the life of a news reporter / anchor / journalist or producer might be like . Basically Jane Craig ( Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Holly Hunter ) falls for new reporter Tom Grunick ( Oscar and Golden Globe nominated William Hurt ) , but correspondent Aaron Altman ( Oscar nominated Albert Brooks ) also has strong feelings for her . The network prepares for big changes , and sparks will fly with all members of the studio .

The comedy is subtle but strong , the romance has it 's moments , and it is certainly a believable situation film . It was nominated the Oscars for Best Cinematography , Best Film Editing , Best Writing , Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen and Best Picture , and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Comedy / Musical and Best Screenplay - Motion Picture .

27637,0,"Much said without words . This is an excellent movie . It was made in color - not color as in today 's films , but a special mono - color use ( with shadings ) that portrayed meaning , mood , sense and time . It should be seen in color , as it becomes an entirely different film . The story , by Nobel prize - winner Selma Lagerlöf , is effectively presented . One never has a clear sense of real , memory or phantom . Changes going on in Swedish society at the time are subtly layered . Most highly recommend . Try to rent it or find it on - line .

27878,0,"SPOILER ALERT ! Do n't read on unless you 're prepared for some spoilers . I think this film had a lot beneath its shell . Besides the apparent connections with "" Oldboy "" ( and Park - wook 's other films ) , an incestuous relation in this one really disturbed me , and also the subtle erotic theme that hung around all the vampiric , physical action . The main actor , Kang - ho Song , is terrific in the rôle of the priest Sang - hyeon - coincidentally , "" sang "" means "" blood "" in some languages - who truly loved Tae - ju , played by OK - bin Kim . Their relationship reminds me a lot of that between Martin Sheen and Sissy Spacek in "" Badlands "" , where the girl appears psychopathic and the man is basically wrapped around her finger . Their relationship is one thing , but the girl 's mother is entirely different . While moving , she is stiff , one - dimensional and taut , but paralysed , she says all through not moving , or through the wink of an eye . Park - wook has really , really mastered his cinematography in this film , and owes a lot to Stanley Kubrick ; there are a whole lot of beautiful shots strewn throughout the film , some for simple effects and some that require several glances and probably repeated views to fully catch . The music is quite stock , using mostly strings to accompany the main thespian 's monoreaction ; it 's a very good thing that the character is as withdrawn as he is . While he does very little and loses at that , he seems to instead be a person who thinks a lot . While his love - interest says and does a lot , her actions display very little thought behind it . In my humble opinion . All in all , a very disturbing film that is not made for action , which is n't even in the same dimension as most things that are about vampires these days ; it 's magnificent , and repellant at the same time .",375,1,0.0003508771929824879,0.0003508771929824879,0.0003508771929824879,0.0003508771929824879,0.0003508771929824879,0.01822328975756073,0.01789596055833337,0.056893748389593254,0.0003508771929824879,0.0003508771929824879,0.0003508771929824879,0.0003508771929824879,0.0003508771929824879,0.0003508771929824879,0.0003508771929824879,0.0003508771929824879,0.0003508771929824879,0.0003508771929824879,0.0003508771929824879,0.0003508771929824879,0.0003508771929824879,0.22757432072888462,0.0003508771929824879,0.0003508771929824879,0.04583523044216729,0.03270004985154634,0.0003508771929824879,0.0003508771929824879,0.0003508771929824879,0.0003508771929824879,0.0003508771929824879,0.0003508771929824879,0.0003508771929824879,0.0003508771929824879,0.0003508771929824879,0.0003508771929824879,0.0003508771929824879,0.0003508771929824879,0.09249179534814893,0.0003508771929824879,0.0003508771929824879,0.0230178892892853,0.0003508771929824879,0.24241105916958128,0.20220855456838893,0.0003508771929824879,0.02706389137019277,0.0003508771929824879,0.0003508771929824879,0.0003508771929824879,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0
28163,0,"A film to divide its viewers . Just criticism points at its funereal pace , over - used snap zooms and persistent , lingering gazes between the protagonists . Advocates point to Dirk Bogarde 's mighty performance and Pasqualino De Santis ' benchmark photography of Venice . Taken altogether , this might suggest an indulgent , romanticised elegy for the nobility of homosexual love ( at a time , 1971 , when it was becoming consensually legal ) . In fact Visconti has succeeded in making a richer , more complex film than such a single - issue vehicle . He has knit his ideas - foibles and all - into a meticulously paced arc . Inside this does indeed sit the central performance of Bogarde 's Aschenbach . Rather than a simpering , Johnny - come - lately gay , he manages to give a pathetic composer beaten by tragedy and misunderstood integrity who sees salvation in Tadzio . His mesmerised staggering around an increasingly hellish Venice after the boy is a straight metaphor for the artist 's tenacity for truth in the teeth of the dilettante mob ( and it is explicitly cut with such a flashback).Mahler 's music is possibly a little over - used although it is well appropriated . The Italian overdub is a wearing anachronism but thankfully the acting does n't suffer too much . 7/10",232,1,0.0007692307692308294,0.0007692307692308294,0.0007692307692308294,0.03944735913485447,0.0007692307692308294,0.0007692307692308294,0.0007692307692308294,0.08785181592252587,0.0007692307692308294,0.0007692307692308294,0.0007692307692308294,0.0007692307692308294,0.0007692307692308294,0.0007692307692308294,0.0007692307692308294,0.0007692307692308294,0.17386144472562784,0.0007692307692308294,0.0007692307692308294,0.0007692307692308294,0.0007692307692308294,0.0007692307692308294,0.0007692307692308294,0.0007692307692308294,0.039398721619662645,0.05403549861917906,0.0007692307692308294,0.0007692307692308294,0.027090073984244924,0.0007692307692308294,0.0007692307692308294,0.0007692307692308294,0.0007692307692308294,0.0007692307692308294,0.0007692307692308294,0.0007692307692308294,0.0007692307692308294,0.0007692307692308294,0.0007692307692308294,0.0007692307692308294,0.0007692307692308294,0.0007692307692308294,0.0007692307692308294,0.4373183639357552,0.0007692307692308294,0.0007692307692308294,0.10868902975045522,0.0007692307692308294,0.0007692307692308294,0.0007692307692308294,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0
28217,0,"A team varied between Scully and Mulder , two other scientists , a pilot , and the guy who plays Bana on Seinfeld , go up to an Arctic research post where all members have died off by either killing each other or killing themselves . They discover there 's a worm- a virus- that is parasitic to the point of madness and death . The problem is , after a certain dog lashes out , anyone could be infected , but who ? This is not just my favorite episode of season 1 , but also one of my favorites from the show . The Arctic environment encloses the characters and , of course like Carpenter 's the Thing , it 's a lot of fun watching these even - tempered characters suddenly start to flip out in dramatic scenes . And the visual effects of the worm and its effects under the skin are cheesy , I did n't mind them at all . The drama between the characters ends up working more than it would usually because of the tension and because all of the actors ( including the Bana guy ) understand what 's going on in the story . And , as usual , I loved the ambiguity of the ending . Highly recommended .",220,1,0.0005405405405405925,0.0005405405405405925,0.0005405405405405925,0.0005405405405405925,0.0005405405405405925,0.02562330359780176,0.05881827999910521,0.0005405405405405925,0.0005405405405405925,0.0005405405405405925,0.0005405405405405925,0.054594594594597666,0.0005405405405405925,0.0005405405405405925,0.0005405405405405925,0.0005405405405405925,0.08851342444607527,0.0005405405405405925,0.0005405405405405925,0.0005405405405405925,0.5626167608083381,0.0005405405405405925,0.0005405405405405925,0.0005405405405405925,0.0005405405405405925,0.0005405405405405925,0.0005405405405405925,0.0005405405405405925,0.0005405405405405925,0.0005405405405405925,0.0005405405405405925,0.0005405405405405925,0.0005405405405405925,0.0005405405405405925,0.13198150718384893,0.05460888612698738,0.0005405405405405925,0.0005405405405405925,0.0005405405405405925,0.0005405405405405925,0.0005405405405405925,0.0005405405405405925,0.0005405405405405925,0.0005405405405405925,0.0005405405405405925,0.0005405405405405925,0.0005405405405405925,0.0005405405405405925,0.0005405405405405925,0.0005405405405405925,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

28573,0,River 's edge is not a PLEASANT film to watch but it is an incredible one . Having viewed it many years ago I truly think it would still have the ability to shock were it to be re released or remade or something . Perhaps no movie ever made has captured the essense of young suburban inertia like this distrubing frightening movie . Given that this is based on a true story it is even more disturbing . Very well acted and just UNPLEASANT at many times to watch but also a little known masterpiece and a truely important film . Should be a mandatory to watch shown nationwide in all highschools .

28713,0,"When a bomber , a patricide , a pornographer , and a mad biker , together with various other forms of social scum , have had enough of their sh * * infested cell , they spot a rat and look for the hole . Escaping from the sewage the group of 9 souls , take advantage of their new found freedom and head for civilization . What soon follows is not surprising . Complete mayhem and terror follow in their wake . It seems that each has some unfinished business to take care of . Loosely based on The Great Escape , 9 SOULS is by far in the top 5 best films I 've seen this year . Running at right around 2 hours 9 SOULS will deliver a story so powerful it 'll literally leave you breathless . The beautiful , yet subtle , use of the rolling country sides adds the realism that is expected from this story . The vision of director Toshiaki Toyoda ( Blue Spring , Porno Star ) , is completely mind boggling as he implements a sense of pity towards the characters . As quickly as each character grasps their dream , it 's as quick as it 's torn from them . Now , all responsibility of the success of this film should not fall solely on the shoulders of the director , yet props must go to the actors as well . This film was full of excellent acting from top to bottom . Ryuhei Matsuda ( the son of Miyuki Matsuda of Audition ) delivers a stellar performance , and seems to bring some of his mothers eeriness to the screen . I must give props to Artsmagic DVD as well . This is the 6th film of theirs I 've seen now , and they seem to get better and better each DVD . The sound quality is perfect and the picture ; clean and crisp . It 's very annoying trying to watch a film that is too dark in transfer , so the discs from theses cats are nice . Bottom line is this film will soon receive masterpiece status by viewers ' world wide . Keep an eye out in 2005 for 9 SOULS ; it 's really amazing film to watch .",389,1,0.0002941176470588495,0.07260235166704967,0.017542738952001428,0.02201574009950463,0.0002941176470588495,0.0002941176470588495,0.015126958228883176,0.0002941176470588495,0.08259945152425842,0.0002941176470588495,0.0002941176470588495,0.0002941176470588495,0.06979802405101185,0.0002941176470588495,0.014999999999998502,0.0002941176470588495,0.0002941176470588495,0.0002941176470588495,0.0002941176470588495,0.0002941176470588495,0.0002941176470588495,0.0002941176470588495,0.0002941176470588495,0.0002941176470588495,0.0002941176470588495,0.0002941176470588495,0.03558059544621342,0.0002941176470588495,0.046681059748817054,0.026587443280962863,0.0002941176470588495,0.0002941176470588495,0.0002941176470588495,0.0002941176470588495,0.0002941176470588495,0.0002941176470588495,0.0002941176470588495,0.0002941176470588495,0.0002941176470588495,0.0002941176470588495,0.0002941176470588495,0.015195660652632602,0.0002941176470588495,0.5527482945125415,0.0002941176470588495,0.0002941176470588495,0.0176393288949477,0.0002941176470588495,0.0002941176470588495,0.0002941176470588495,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0
28809,0,"This film certainly was n't very sophisticated . No , the humor was in fact pretty dumb now that I think about it . But , also while I think of it , I did laugh -- proving decent comedy does n't need to be very deep . Fatty Arbuckle is the definite star of this short , despite Buster Keaton 's appearing in the film as well . He is the butcher in an old - time grocery store . A lot of silly stuff occurred in the store and I think I laughed the most at the coffee grinder sequence -- you'll just have to see it yourself . Anyway , later , Fatty 's girlfriend is forced to go to a girls ' school and because he ca n't stand to part , he dresses in drag and infiltrates the school . Arbuckle is one ugly woman ! So , for silly and unsophisticated fun , see this film .

28817,0,"George Hearn really went all out and over the top which in this case was great . I 've heard the Len Cariou version but it was too tame . George was great in that character - very expressive . Angela Lansbury was perfect for the part . She gave a great performance . She gave the Mrs. Lovett a great devious and comical personality which balanced out the dark story . I love the dark humor when Angela Lansbury sings her songs as well as her physical expressions and the angry emotions of George Hearn in his songs of rage , vengeance and distress . I've watched this play 20 times since 1985 when I saw it on PBS .

29052,0,"I was very impressed with what Eddie Monroe was able to accomplish in regards to its overall affect on me . I say this because I know this independent film had a limited budget / resources , but despite this , it comes across as a convincing and well crafted piece of work . Enjoyable from start to finish with several relatively unknown actors which I ca n't help but believe will make a big noise in the industry in years to come , Eddie Monroe did n't fail to keep my interest engaged and my emotional meter dancing . It 's a well scripted story with a startling ending despite my effort to not be taken off guard . Many of the cast names listed for this film are names to look out for in the future . Someone told me that Paul Regina recently passed , and if this is true it 's a real tragedy since his stoic performance in Eddie Monroe is remarkable .

But what really got to me was the hammer and sickle emblem and what appeared to be a Chinese ideogram adjacent the logo , aft of the pilot 's seat on the starboard side of the fuselage . Remember when the mutual acquaintance Neil and Jill encounter says that Jim'd become a general in a Chinese rebel army ? That , based on the hammer and sickle , could only have been the People 's Revolutionary Army of Mao Tse Dung ! ! ! Never mind the undies and the unwed twosome in bed -- would that logo and that reference have survived during the Cold War ? Additional observation 12/27 : This film of the 30 's with the soviet emblem may / must also reflect the influence on and charm of communism in Hollywood and much of America during the Depression . Adds to the historical value of this terrific film . Also I liked the American Dream aspects of two guys from Winnemucca taking at least part of the world by storm , Red - Blooded ( literally and copiously in Jim 's case)American Boys . Others have commented more ably than I on the aerobatics , etc . I loved it all . This gem deserved more than the mere 1.5 stars Osborne and Co. rated it on TCM , if only for recording parts of American history of the early 30s .",284,1,0.14293076207216548,0.0006451612903226401,0.0006451612903226401,0.0006451612903226401,0.0006451612903226401,0.06542482962522335,0.0006451612903226401,0.0006451612903226401,0.0006451612903226401,0.0006451612903226401,0.0006451612903226401,0.0006451612903226401,0.0006451612903226401,0.0006451612903226401,0.0006451612903226401,0.0006451612903226401,0.0885875751103239,0.0006451612903226401,0.032903217407392854,0.0006451612903226401,0.0006451612903226401,0.09927696106805779,0.0006451612903226401,0.0006451612903226401,0.0006451612903226401,0.0006451612903226401,0.0006451612903226401,0.0006451612903226401,0.0006451612903226401,0.0006451612903226401,0.0006451612903226401,0.16193548387098158,0.0006451612903226401,0.0006451612903226401,0.03829512763855502,0.0006451612903226401,0.0006451612903226401,0.0006451612903226401,0.0006451612903226401,0.0006451612903226401,0.08713482991034993,0.0006451612903226401,0.0339415127056171,0.18507860710651114,0.0006451612903226401,0.03932980316223919,0.0006451612903226401,0.0006451612903226401,0.0006451612903226401,0.0006451612903226401,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0

30266,0,"What exactly do people expect when they watch an Al Adamson film ? Are they expecting classic cinema that is wonderful beyond belief and will leave them with lasting memories ? You 'd think so by some of the reviews . Al Adamson 's films are trashy and sleazy and cheesy , not much more , so if you go into them knowing that already it helps , and they are n't necessarily to be taken at face value , especially when they have so much unintentional entertainment value . First off , this starts by ripping off the end theme music from Outer Limits , so you know things are looking promising . This is the story of some wacko cult that lives in the hills and while trying to raise a dead body , the leader suffers a heart attack and ends up in the hospital . Of course Nurse Sherri tends to his needs and all , and when an operation is needed she just happens to be hanging out in the operating room when the guy passes on so his spirit invades her . And Nurse Sherri begins to change . No longer the nice nurse , she develops a taste for blood and sharp objects . There 's a couple little side stories going on like folks trying to burn the body of the dead cult leader and a blinded football star that has become the love object of one of Sherri 's co - workers who also just happens to dabble in voodoo . This is not bad if you 're a cult film fan , but it may be bad if you 're a "" Spiderman "" fan because you wo n't like it . At times this actually lurches towards "" respectability "" ( for Adamson , anyway ) but then it "" unredeems : itself with some ridiculous event .

30666,0,""" Lets swap Murders- your wife , my father""- seemingly innocent conversation between two strangers - Bruno Anthony and Guy Haines when they meet over lunch on a train journey . Guy , a solid , respectable tennis player , whose problem is that his wife , the flirtatious Miriam , wo n't divorce him so he can marry senators daughter Anne , laughs the whole conversation off as a joke . The following week he is n't laughing any more . In a scene of classic Hitchcock suspense , Bruno stalks Miriam through a carnival and strangles her . As he does , her glasses fall off and we see the murder eerily reflected twice through her lenses . Cold hearted and amoral Bruno , his part of the deal completed , approaches an appalled Guy expecting , even pressuring him into ' doing his bit . ' Matters are not helped when Anne 's precocious and outspoken younger sister turns up suspecting Guy of Miriam 's murder . So accused of a murder he did n't commit and expected to commit another , what is Guy going to do ? The power of this film is in the presentation of human beings as having a murderous side to their nature - and this Hitchcock does to perfection .",220,1,0.0006896551724138597,0.0006896551724138597,0.0006896551724138597,0.04284074346653373,0.044818409229580046,0.0006896551724138597,0.0006896551724138597,0.04122096112092659,0.0006896551724138597,0.0006896551724138597,0.0006896551724138597,0.0006896551724138597,0.0006896551724138597,0.0006896551724138597,0.0006896551724138597,0.0006896551724138597,0.368969480508738,0.0006896551724138597,0.0006896551724138597,0.0006896551724138597,0.0006896551724138597,0.0006896551724138597,0.033844369798363465,0.0006896551724138597,0.0006896551724138597,0.0006896551724138597,0.0006896551724138597,0.0006896551724138597,0.0006896551724138597,0.0338127667856376,0.0006896551724138597,0.0006896551724138597,0.0006896551724138597,0.0006896551724138597,0.0006896551724138597,0.0006896551724138597,0.0006896551724138597,0.0006896551724138597,0.0006896551724138597,0.07987370906274464,0.0006896551724138597,0.10413798507929554,0.07479656291926666,0.1480988051323594,0.0006896551724138597,0.0006896551724138597,0.0006896551724138597,0.0006896551724138597,0.0006896551724138597,0.0006896551724138597,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
30788,0,"Victor Mature , as a barely civilized and mostly out of control mountain man and trapper , may be on the poster , but Robert Preston as a failed Union colonel who led his men to get "" cut to ribbons "" by Confederate artillery at Shiloh , and is sent to a fort in Oregon for his incompetence , has the most interesting part , married to a young and hard to recognize at first Anne Bancroft . The uncivilized Mature lusts for the colonel 's wife , giving the film an interesting and even dark subplot which goes so far as to reference coveting another man 's wife at one point by James Whitmore who plays Mature 's older and wiser mountain man father figure . Directed by Anthony Mann , this film is lost among his more famous westerns with James Stewart , but even so you really do n't need the Indian menace to make this a film worth seeing , although Preston gets to prove his bad judgement as a commanding officer again in a failed expedition to finally bring the Indians under submission , in a well staged attack among the forest that quickly turns into a rout .",205,1,0.000606060606060653,0.000606060606060653,0.000606060606060653,0.000606060606060653,0.000606060606060653,0.000606060606060653,0.000606060606060653,0.40471435865772776,0.13292212495250919,0.000606060606060653,0.000606060606060653,0.000606060606060653,0.000606060606060653,0.000606060606060653,0.000606060606060653,0.000606060606060653,0.07290853425208987,0.000606060606060653,0.000606060606060653,0.000606060606060653,0.000606060606060653,0.000606060606060653,0.000606060606060653,0.000606060606060653,0.000606060606060653,0.000606060606060653,0.000606060606060653,0.000606060606060653,0.000606060606060653,0.000606060606060653,0.000606060606060653,0.000606060606060653,0.0360785308004774,0.000606060606060653,0.000606060606060653,0.000606060606060653,0.000606060606060653,0.000606060606060653,0.000606060606060653,0.000606060606060653,0.000606060606060653,0.030909090909090223,0.000606060606060653,0.2958006937614368,0.000606060606060653,0.000606060606060653,0.000606060606060653,0.000606060606060653,0.000606060606060653,0.000606060606060653,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

31332,0,"First of all I have to say that I 'm a huge Lucio Fulci and Dario Argento fan . Although I have not seen absolutely all of their movies , I really enjoyed almost every one I did see . I really like giallos and I thought Argento was the master of this genre , after seeing films like "" Tenebre "" and "" Phenomena "" . But after I saw "" New York Ripper "" by Fulci , I found out that he could do pretty good giallos besides his graphic zombie movies and even outdo Argento , on a certain level . I love Fulci 's style , and yes I love gore , but this film I think , although it has a more developed plot and characters than his other films , is not his best one . What I do n't like is that it can be confusing at times , especially at the end . And the fact that we go from one suspect , to another , and then another until we even suspect the retarded little girl for a moment , I think it goes too far . I know giallos are supposed to keep you guessing until the end , and the killer should be very hard to find , but this film plays a little too much with our minds . However I did like the scene when the witch is killed , I think it is very well done and gave me the chills . The acting is also pretty good and the photography is great . Although this is not a bad film , I think Lucio Fulci has made better films than this , and I think his best one is "" The Beyond "" , a very different movie but a more atmospheric and visual experience . I give "" Do n't torture a duckling "" a 7 out of 10 .",326,1,0.00028985507246378735,0.00028985507246378735,0.00028985507246378735,0.00028985507246378735,0.00028985507246378735,0.00028985507246378735,0.00028985507246378735,0.00028985507246378735,0.00028985507246378735,0.00028985507246378735,0.00028985507246378735,0.00028985507246378735,0.00028985507246378735,0.00028985507246378735,0.00028985507246378735,0.00028985507246378735,0.00028985507246378735,0.00028985507246378735,0.00028985507246378735,0.00028985507246378735,0.49788178650862597,0.21776312766075068,0.00028985507246378735,0.00028985507246378735,0.00028985507246378735,0.00028985507246378735,0.00028985507246378735,0.00028985507246378735,0.00028985507246378735,0.00028985507246378735,0.00028985507246378735,0.00028985507246378735,0.00028985507246378735,0.00028985507246378735,0.06426366858929654,0.00028985507246378735,0.00028985507246378735,0.00028985507246378735,0.00028985507246378735,0.00028985507246378735,0.00028985507246378735,0.00028985507246378735,0.00028985507246378735,0.2067580839079925,0.00028985507246378735,0.00028985507246378735,0.00028985507246378735,0.00028985507246378735,0.00028985507246378735,0.00028985507246378735,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

Later on there were some other authors but they only did a few episodes . The first director who did most of the series ( I think complete series 1 ) was Ian Sharp who created the distinct look of Robin of Sherwood . Clannad did indeed see some of the material and they read the scrips . I know this for sure because Richard Carpenter told it on a Con in England last year .

But I 'll try to put all the things I liked about the movie in one paragraph and everything I did n't like in another paragraph , so it will be easier to read ! Let 's start with the good things ! The quote "" strong bloody violence "" ( which is used by rating boards , to describe the content of a movie , does fit here very well . This is not a movie for kids ! Or for the faint of hearted ! It has Blade as a central character ( Wesley Snipes is phenomenal ) and a crazy enough story thread to hold / justify the action scenes ! The original idea is also very engaging and intelligent . The action scenes are great here too . OK over to the things I did n't like . The overall story is too thin . It 's enough as I 've written above to hold the action scenes together , but there could be more . And a character like Blade deserves more ( imo ) . The drama therefor is n't the best ... also it 's use of clichés does n't help . Some characters are underwritten ...

32176,0,"The film is about the battle of Stalingrad . For those of you who do n't know anything about it , it was the worst battle in the Second World War . Over 1 million people died in the course of the battle . This is the only film that I 've seen that seems to have actually captured how bad things were in the war between Russia and Germany . What I really liked about it is that the two ideologies ( Nazism and Communism ) were nowhere in the film . Unlike most American films , the Germans are not seen as blood thirsty murderers , but what the average German foot soldier was , a person . The film revolves around four soldiers fighting in Stalingrad . They were transferred there to try and take the city . The film follows these men from August of 1942 to early 1943 . During this time , they learn about the horrors of war and try to find a way out of the battle . Through the entire film , one feels the desperation of the entire battle . Unlike "" Enemy at the Gates "" the film makers did n't try to put some sappy love story or dress up factual occurrences of the battle . This film may be fiction , but it conveys what happened in the bloodiest battle in World War II .",238,1,0.0004545454545454809,0.0004545454545454809,0.0004545454545454809,0.1481045057429423,0.0004545454545454809,0.0004545454545454809,0.0004545454545454809,0.16123369727875222,0.0004545454545454809,0.0004545454545454809,0.0004545454545454809,0.0004545454545454809,0.08142895307797031,0.0004545454545454809,0.0004545454545454809,0.0004545454545454809,0.0004545454545454809,0.0004545454545454809,0.0004545454545454809,0.0004545454545454809,0.0004545454545454809,0.05870739893217909,0.0004545454545454809,0.0004545454545454809,0.0004545454545454809,0.05481068019514593,0.0004545454545454809,0.0004545454545454809,0.0004545454545454809,0.0004545454545454809,0.0004545454545454809,0.11418476317937963,0.0004545454545454809,0.0004545454545454809,0.0004545454545454809,0.0004545454545454809,0.0004545454545454809,0.0004545454545454809,0.0004545454545454809,0.0004545454545454809,0.0004545454545454809,0.0004545454545454809,0.0004545454545454809,0.33118435565520804,0.0004545454545454809,0.03125473684751232,0.0004545454545454809,0.0004545454545454809,0.0004545454545454809,0.0004545454545454809,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0

32777,0,"I 'm pleased that this was the work of foreign cinematographers because it ca n't be accused of unfair bias . With absolutely no cause , the Jacksonville cops rush to judgment in this case and pick the first black suspect to accuse of the murder of a white , foreign tourist . They picked a 15 yr . old kid who is just about as close to a saint as you could randomly find and then make fools of themselves trying to pin an unlikely case against him . In addition to the unfairness resulting from the blatant prejudice there is the matter of 6 months of unjust imprisonment of a completely innocent young black teenager . It makes one question whether as a society we should compensate those who are charged , imprisoned and subsequently found innocent .

33110,0,"I saw this movie on TV back in the 60s and it still stands up well even after brilliant performances as a DI by R. Lee Ermey , Lou Gossett and even Frank Sutton ( in a comic vein ) on Gomer Pyle USMC . I was n't in the service but my brother had a recording of a Drill Instructor in the Air Force and it was scary . Others in the family who were Marines told me that Ermey and even Sutton were pretty spot on in their roles . The only thing missing in "" The D. I. "" is the language . In 1958 they could n't yet use profanity on film , yet Jack Webb came across pretty damned tough without it . I think it 's his best role ever . In Dragnet he was quite stiff I 'll admit , though not as bad as George Raft , but he used it only to effect in "" The D. I. "" You never forget the funeral for the dead flea ! The romantic part was just to stretch the movie , but did n't really interfere with the basic plot . Don Dubbins was pretty good to but he never surpassed this film in his career . As far as patriotism , Jack Webb was TV 's John Wayne . He carried it a bit too far in some Dragnet episodes , but not in "" The D. I. "" After 40 some years I hoped the film could stand up to the likes "" Full Metal Jacket "" and others ; and it did !",273,1,0.0005000000000000362,0.0005000000000000362,0.0005000000000000362,0.0005000000000000362,0.0005000000000000362,0.026251618915881608,0.0005000000000000362,0.0005000000000000362,0.0005000000000000362,0.0005000000000000362,0.0005000000000000362,0.0005000000000000362,0.0005000000000000362,0.0005000000000000362,0.0005000000000000362,0.0005000000000000362,0.0005000000000000362,0.0005000000000000362,0.0005000000000000362,0.0005000000000000362,0.20629133475852554,0.26003062413067146,0.0005000000000000362,0.05252115452236974,0.0005000000000000362,0.0005000000000000362,0.0005000000000000362,0.0005000000000000362,0.0005000000000000362,0.0005000000000000362,0.0005000000000000362,0.0005000000000000362,0.11275489746390163,0.0005000000000000362,0.0005000000000000362,0.0005000000000000362,0.0005000000000000362,0.025732748402521773,0.0005000000000000362,0.0005000000000000362,0.07058341334497836,0.0005000000000000362,0.0005000000000000362,0.12413266086985293,0.0005000000000000362,0.05311643543425323,0.048585112157042115,0.0005000000000000362,0.0005000000000000362,0.0005000000000000362,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0

This film was good stuff , it was fast faced , the performances were very good from the actors / actresses ( Tanya Roberts was very sexy ) and the film was never boring , and like i say , it had some very creepy scenes , so be prepared to hide under the covers !

In this case , Dan Aykroyd plays a mental patient who poses as a psychiatrist , and he goes to Beverly Hills to sub for Charles Grodin . Most of the movie 's humor springs from their satirical look at Beverly Hills and people 's empty lives there ( a woman has a power struggle with her maid).It 's the sort of movie that you just watch to have a good time . Do n't expect any kind of religious experience . But you 'll most likely laugh a lot at how the Beverly Hills people flaunt their wealth .

33752,0,"Shame , is a Swedish film in Swedish with English subtitles . The film is about a husband and wife named Jan , and Eva . They live on an island working as farmers . There is a war going on and soldiers start attacking people on the island . Once the war subsides a little Jan , and Eva are arrested as going along with the opposite side . Once released even more trouble ensues and the film shows how two ordinary people will act in a situation of war and life or death . Winner of The CEC Award for Best Foreign Film at The Cinema Writers Circle Awards , The Guldbagge Award for Best Actress ( Liv Ullman , who plays Eva ) at The Guldbagge Awards , The NBR Award for Best Foreign Language Film and Best Actress at The National Board Of Review and The NSFC Award for Best Actress , Best Director ( Ingmar Bergman ) and Best Film at The National Society Of Film Critics Awards . Shame , has good direction , a good script , good performances by both Max Von Sydow ( who plays Jan ) and Liv Ullman ( who plays Eva ) , good cinematography and good production design . Shame , is a well acted and well made story of how people in a desperate situation will sometimes do whatever they can do in order to survive . The film has a powerful message and is a good film . The reason I'am not rating this film higher is because it is not a masterpiece like some other Ingmar Bergman films like Wild Strawberries , The Seventh Seal or Persona , for example . The film did n't have as big an impact on me as I thought it would and it lacked Ingmar Bergman 's thoughtful and philosophical dialog . While nowhere close to being one of his best films there is still a lot to like about Shame , and it is a good movie . I just probably would have liked it more having not seen some of those other Bergman masterpieces .",359,1,0.0002666666666666866,0.0002666666666666866,0.0002666666666666866,0.0002666666666666866,0.0002666666666666866,0.0002666666666666866,0.0002666666666666866,0.0662851295028439,0.12132165236568337,0.0002666666666666866,0.0002666666666666866,0.0002666666666666866,0.0002666666666666866,0.0002666666666666866,0.0002666666666666866,0.0002666666666666866,0.12878915117256753,0.0002666666666666866,0.0002666666666666866,0.0002666666666666866,0.0002666666666666866,0.16780985391332034,0.0002666666666666866,0.0002666666666666866,0.0002666666666666866,0.0002666666666666866,0.0002666666666666866,0.0002666666666666866,0.0002666666666666866,0.0002666666666666866,0.0002666666666666866,0.04048231866132237,0.0002666666666666866,0.0002666666666666866,0.0002666666666666866,0.0002666666666666866,0.0002666666666666866,0.03270798088437047,0.0002666666666666866,0.0002666666666666866,0.0002666666666666866,0.0002666666666666866,0.0002666666666666866,0.40336219605674334,0.028041717443147953,0.0002666666666666866,0.0002666666666666866,0.0002666666666666866,0.0002666666666666866,0.0002666666666666866,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0

I truly believe that Ida Lupino was not given the true credit she deserved for her great talents in the Movie Industry ! ! !",157,1,0.0006250000000000497,0.0006250000000000497,0.043066265644888975,0.0006250000000000497,0.08163459064087257,0.0006250000000000497,0.0006250000000000497,0.0006250000000000497,0.03581839163890041,0.0006250000000000497,0.0006250000000000497,0.0006250000000000497,0.0006250000000000497,0.0006250000000000497,0.0006250000000000497,0.0006250000000000497,0.0006250000000000497,0.0006250000000000497,0.031782911637575614,0.0006250000000000497,0.0006250000000000497,0.0712660374709815,0.0006250000000000497,0.0006250000000000497,0.03276219367964557,0.07612280465122098,0.0006250000000000497,0.0006250000000000497,0.0006250000000000497,0.05044412225395912,0.0006250000000000497,0.0006250000000000497,0.0006250000000000497,0.0006250000000000497,0.0006250000000000497,0.08907099351030313,0.0006250000000000497,0.0006250000000000497,0.0006250000000000497,0.0006250000000000497,0.0006250000000000497,0.0006250000000000497,0.0006250000000000497,0.4630316888716501,0.0006250000000000497,0.0006250000000000497,0.0006250000000000497,0.0006250000000000497,0.0006250000000000497,0.0006250000000000497,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
34062,0,"I just saw this at SIFF , and I absolutely loved it . There were parts where I laughed so hard I could n't catch my breath . The script and direction by Glenn McQuaid are fantastic . I ca n't wait to see more from this talented young man . The performances make the movie . Larry Fessenden and Dominic Monaghan are just delightful as the graverobber Willy and his apprentice Arthur . Ron Perlman turns in a fantastic performance ( as usual ) as a less - than - sympathetic jailhouse priest . Bonus : Angus Scrimm as an unscrupulous doctor ! As always , he balances menace and humor perfectly . This is a style of horror comedy that really has n't been seen since Vincent Price did "" Comedy of Terrors , "" "" The Raven , "" and "" Theater of Blood . "" The movie is genuinely scary in places , then it 'll suddenly flip back into hilarious mode , keeping you totally off balance . Some parts are scary and funny at the same time . I can only afford to see three movies at SIFF this year , but even if the other two are awful , "" I Sell The Dead "" was worth the price of all three .

Ellen is angry the beginning of the movie , but as time passes she ends up understanding her mothers ' life time dedication to her family . She even asks her mom : How do you do his , every day , in and out and nobody notices it ? That is what women do , a lot of what I call invisible work . Moreover we clean , we fix , we mend , we stretch , we celebrate , we are the best friends , we are confidants , the mistress , outreachers , disciplinarians , sensitive . Some of us , like both women in this movie , have the perfect education , are the psychological pillar for the entire family and also do all that invisible work ! That is Kate Ellen , and many women in our society . Many of us have already gone through that stage of life when our parents age and died . I have been there . They just went too young . I have given my parents my thanks , but I never understood them as well as when I had to play their roles , and had to walk in their shoes . This movie mirrors the reality of life . Perhaps it is sad , but that is how life is , at times . George a Professor at Harvard is complicated person , who appears to think that his work is more important than everybody else , and has a very "" master / servant "" mentality toward the women in his life . He is not strong enough to cope . If you want to see good acting and the reality of life do not miss this movie . Favorite Scenes : The restaurant coming to Kate , violins and all . The making of a table out of broken china . That I so symbolic ! We are all broken vessels !

34819,0,"As has already been noted , the short film "" Every Sunday "" ( 1936 ) could be considered the first music video . This was a happy accident resulting from MGM 's need to crank out a variety of short films for exhibit with its feature length material . They had a couple fresh young singing talents ( Judy Garland and Deanna Durbin ) available and essentially slapped together a blend of music styles in a kind of Norman Rockwell concert in the park setting . Who would have dreamed at the time that they would capture the best collection of images since Eisenstein 's "" Odessa Steps "" sequence . It 's Sunday with some inattentive folks sitting around a small wooden band shell in the park while a tired looking ensemble play Strauss .

35082,0,"Sometimes , you 're up late at night flipping through the stations , bored out of your mind , and wanting some light and fluffy romantic comedy that does n't make you feel bipolar . And this movie fit that exact billing . Sure , the plot was ripped right out of the 1930s .... the writing as schmaltzy as the Hallmark Greeting Card company 's legendary poetry , and the one- dimensional characters were played by a cast plucked straight from Central Casting - but it was CUTE , and exactly what I needed last night . Lauren Holly and Costas Mandylor have great chemistry together - I liked it on "" Picket Fences , "" and I 'm happy to say they still have it over 10 year later . Costas Mandylor , at 41 , is still possibly one of the handsomest men to grace the screens since ol' Rudy Valentino kicked the bucket 80 years ago . RRROWRR ! Bonus points for casting that funny man who used to be on the roller skates on that show about the cartoon lady . I always thought he was something straight out of a Hepburn - Grant comedy . BRAVO!Some people will probably say this was the corniest piece of cinema ever made , and I would probably have to agree - but come on ! It 's on the Hallmark Channel . What were you expecting ? Just sit back , relax , eat some sesame sticks , and watch a sweet little movie with two cute people and down a bottle of Zinfandel . Trust me , you 'll love and accept the schmaltz a whole lot more , and then you can go to sleep dreaming about Costas Mandylor swimming in a sea of tempered chocolate feeding you petit fours with minty fresh chocolate icing . YUMMO ! ( PS . Now I have a hankering for petit fours . THANKS A LOT , HALLMARK!)I really wish the evil girl had been cast with Rachel Ray , and maybe that dishy food nerd Alton Brown as the announcer instead of the creepy dude with the Van Dyk beard . Shudder ! That would have made my night . But hey , check out "" Just Desserts .

35243,0,"I hardly know where to begin in writing about this gem , except to say that it represents young Buster Keaton at the peak of his powers and must certainly rank with the half - dozen best short comedies ever made . THE GOAT is twenty minutes of smoothly paced , expertly photographed , beautifully executed gags ; two reels of non - stop comic invention driven by an unmistakable undercurrent of paranoia and yet somehow leading to a happy ending -- which was n't always the way with Buster 's comedies . ( See COPS for one case where Fatalism ultimately got the better of him , or ONE WEEK for the victory of Defeatism . ) If I had to describe this film in one word I 'd call it "" effortless , "" but if I were permitted two I 'd call it "" seemingly effortless , "" for surely a lot of hard labor goes into the making of any comic opus that unfolds with such sublime ease . Still , they did n't call him the Great Stone Face for nothing : Buster never let the public see him sweat . A sardonic title card tells us that our opening sequence is set "" along Millionaires ' Row , "" i.e. on a bread line in a grim urban setting , where Buster waits patiently at the back of the line and , as a result , does n't get fed . But it needs to be emphasized that not for one moment does he play for pathos ; Buster has our sympathy , but he never asks for it . Before long , through a series of accidents , coincidences and absurd misunderstandings , Buster is believed to be an escaped killer named Dead Shot Dan and is being pursued by every cop for miles around , and yet while he 's clearly dismayed by this turn of events there is never a hint of self - pity or even surprise ; we get the sense he always knew that this is what life would have in store for him , and that he has n't time to feel sorry for himself anyway , he has to figure out new ways to dodge those cops and escape from the latest trap . Just as Buster refrains from playing for sympathy he never seems to strain for laughs either , which is especially impressive because THE GOAT must be one of the most laugh - packed short comedies in existence . This is the film that features that iconic shot of Buster riding a train 's cow - catcher right up to the very lens of the camera , which is n't a gag exactly but sure is laugh - provoking in its own strange way . Meanwhile , there are gags involving guns , dogs , cops , an incredibly furry mustache , and a clay statue of a horse that melts under Buster 's weight ( a surreal sight indeed ) , but some of the biggest boffos are saved for the finale when Buster is trying to elude his primary nemesis , Big Joe Roberts , a rotund cop who also happens to be the father of leading lady Virginia Fox . Trapped in Big Joe 's dining room , Buster leap - frogs over him and sails through a transom , turns a phone - booth into an elevator and pretends to disappear , and eventually uses the elevator itself to rid himself of his pursuer and win the girl in time for one last fade - out gag . To say more would be a disservice to first - time viewers . I only wish I could see this film in a theater full of people who 'd never seen it before , and float on the laughter . Live musical accompaniment would be nice too ; and incidentally the musical score supplied by Kino for their home video / DVD version of THE GOAT is first - rate , serving as icing on an already tasty cake .",689,1,0.0690858885540619,0.05377671813034566,0.00023529411764708745,0.01426123938700595,0.00023529411764708745,0.00023529411764708745,0.00023529411764708745,0.10126601845284736,0.033254372447524744,0.00023529411764708745,0.00023529411764708745,0.00023529411764708745,0.00023529411764708745,0.00023529411764708745,0.012178667947342788,0.00023529411764708745,0.00023529411764708745,0.00023529411764708745,0.011995016188000227,0.00023529411764708745,0.00023529411764708745,0.00023529411764708745,0.00023529411764708745,0.014342252661428105,0.033248961039379084,0.00023529411764708745,0.11939373352875654,0.00023529411764708745,0.00023529411764708745,0.00023529411764708745,0.00023529411764708745,0.00023529411764708745,0.00023529411764708745,0.00023529411764708745,0.00023529411764708745,0.00023529411764708745,0.00023529411764708745,0.00023529411764708745,0.00023529411764708745,0.039956202433002685,0.00023529411764708745,0.022310729999240497,0.00023529411764708745,0.27542409623870906,0.12154351216703116,0.04851524662938412,0.021447344195939372,0.00023529411764708745,0.00023529411764708745,0.00023529411764708745,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0

35557,0,"Just ingenious enough to be plausible and still a lot of fun , this is a pure slice of the 1970s ( Even the cops need haircuts badly ! ) . Shot in and around London , the plot of the American ex - con who tries going straight but finds himself sent as an electrician to a bank in Mayfair , and then has the screws put on by crime lord David Niven , and finds himself plotting the crime of the century is well - handled . I liked its simplicity and even innocence , it harks back to a time when caper films where just that , a caper , and violence was n't a part of the deal . All in all you could do a lot worse than watch this : it has enough twists and turns to give it some oomph and a cast that obviously had fun making it . Nicely made and watchable .",162,1,0.0009523809523810288,0.0009523809523810288,0.0009523809523810288,0.0009523809523810288,0.12400754713568644,0.0009523809523810288,0.0009523809523810288,0.0009523809523810288,0.0009523809523810288,0.0009523809523810288,0.0009523809523810288,0.0009523809523810288,0.0009523809523810288,0.0009523809523810288,0.0009523809523810288,0.0009523809523810288,0.0009523809523810288,0.0009523809523810288,0.0009523809523810288,0.0009523809523810288,0.0009523809523810288,0.3211369833351543,0.0009523809523810288,0.0009523809523810288,0.0009523809523810288,0.0009523809523810288,0.0009523809523810288,0.0009523809523810288,0.0009523809523810288,0.0009523809523810288,0.0009523809523810288,0.048625020797778556,0.0009523809523810288,0.0009523809523810288,0.0009523809523810288,0.0009523809523810288,0.0009523809523810288,0.0009523809523810288,0.0009523809523810288,0.0009523809523810288,0.0009523809523810288,0.0009523809523810288,0.0009523809523810288,0.39637092342641567,0.06700238244781871,0.0009523809523810288,0.0009523809523810288,0.0009523809523810288,0.0009523809523810288,0.0009523809523810288,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1

35670,0,"I thought that this is a wonderfully written movie . I love little Scamp , and the street - wise Angel . This movie is very easy for little kids to understand , but a good movie for adults as well . I liked this movie because it continues the original Lady and the Tramp , and that movie is a classic . Lady and the Tramp 2 Scamp 's Adventure was filled with new characters , catchy songs , brilliant animation , and unforgettable classic characters . I have loved the movie ever since I saw it for the first time . I also loved how they showed the different personalities of each character . It also shows the downfalls and good things of making new friends that you can hang out with . My favorite song in the movie was Always there because it showed the different characters sharing their views on how they feel . I definitely recommend this movie for everyone that was a fan of the original Lady and the Tramp .",177,1,0.00044444444444447363,0.04579529559103174,0.00044444444444447363,0.00044444444444447363,0.00044444444444447363,0.07508357081615967,0.00044444444444447363,0.00044444444444447363,0.00044444444444447363,0.00044444444444447363,0.00044444444444447363,0.00044444444444447363,0.00044444444444447363,0.00044444444444447363,0.00044444444444447363,0.00044444444444447363,0.00044444444444447363,0.00044444444444447363,0.00044444444444447363,0.00044444444444447363,0.540002512779809,0.17283164915265234,0.00044444444444447363,0.00044444444444447363,0.00044444444444447363,0.00044444444444447363,0.00044444444444447363,0.00044444444444447363,0.00044444444444447363,0.00044444444444447363,0.00044444444444447363,0.00044444444444447363,0.00044444444444447363,0.00044444444444447363,0.11943485838083745,0.00044444444444447363,0.00044444444444447363,0.00044444444444447363,0.00044444444444447363,0.00044444444444447363,0.00044444444444447363,0.00044444444444447363,0.00044444444444447363,0.00044444444444447363,0.00044444444444447363,0.00044444444444447363,0.027296557723952924,0.00044444444444447363,0.00044444444444447363,0.00044444444444447363,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

35778,0,""" The China Syndrome "" launched a whole string of films about the potentially devastating effects of misused nuclear power , a black cloud of paranoia that would hang over America for much of the Reagan years . It 's a well - made and effective drama , given an extra punch by its high - power stars , notably Jack Lemmon who plays a senior official of the nuclear power plant who suffers a crisis of conscience . But one ca n't help but think that it was the serendipitous timing of the Three Mile Island nuclear accident that occurred just a couple of weeks after this film 's release that has given it its lasting appeal as a classic from the 70s . As watchable as it is , it 's certainly no classic . With a red - headed Jane Fonda as a news reporter and a bearded Michael Douglas as her camera man ( and the film 's producer , by the way).Grade : B+",169,1,0.0007692307692308245,0.0007692307692308245,0.0007692307692308245,0.0007692307692308245,0.0007692307692308245,0.0007692307692308245,0.03923076923076926,0.0007692307692308245,0.0007692307692308245,0.0007692307692308245,0.0007692307692308245,0.0007692307692308245,0.0007692307692308245,0.0007692307692308245,0.0007692307692308245,0.0007692307692308245,0.0007692307692308245,0.0007692307692308245,0.0007692307692308245,0.0007692307692308245,0.0007692307692308245,0.0007692307692308245,0.0007692307692308245,0.0007692307692308245,0.0007692307692308245,0.05479789996352701,0.16313332015855006,0.0007692307692308245,0.0007692307692308245,0.0007692307692308245,0.0007692307692308245,0.0007692307692308245,0.0007692307692308245,0.0007692307692308245,0.0007692307692308245,0.07125318573253248,0.0007692307692308245,0.0007692307692308245,0.0007692307692308245,0.0007692307692308245,0.08204987264890007,0.11615384615385309,0.0007692307692308245,0.44030418303494273,0.0007692307692308245,0.0007692307692308245,0.0007692307692308245,0.0007692307692308245,0.0007692307692308245,0.0007692307692308245,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
35837,0,"So Dark The Night poses a tough challenge : It 's very hard to write about it in any detail without ruining it for those who have n't yet seen it . Since it remains quite obscure , that includes just about everybody . The movie will strike those familiar with its director Joseph H. Lewis ' better known titles in the noir cycle  Gun Crazy , The Big Combo , even My Name Is Julia Ross , which in its brevity it resembles  as an odd choice . For starters , the bucolic French countryside serves as its setting . Steven Geray , a middle - aged detective with the Surété in Paris , sets out for a vacation in the village of Ste . Margot ( or maybe Margaux ) . Quite unexpectedly , he finds himself falling in love with the inkeepers ' daughter ( Micheline Cheirel ) , even though she 's betrothed to a rough - hewn local farmer . But the siren song of life in Paris is hard to resist , so she agrees to marry him , despite the disparity in their ages , which inevitably becomes the talk of the town . But on the night of their engagement party , she fails to return to the inn . Soon , a hunchback finds her body by the river . Her jealous , jilted lover is the logical suspect , but he , too , is found dead . Then anonymous notes threaten more deaths , which come to pass . For the first time in his career , the bereaved Geray finds himself stumped .... A particularly weak script all but does the movie in ; it plays like bad Cornell Woolrich crossed with The Murder of Roger Ackroyd . But Lewis does this creaky vehicle proud . He takes his time near the beginning , but then the story  and the storytelling  gain momentum ( alas , just about the time the script breaks an axle ) . Burnett Guffey lighted and photographed the film , with an intriguing leitmotif of peering out of and peeping into windows ; there 's also an effective score by Hugo Friedhofer , who supplied aural menace to many noirs . A good deal of talent has been lavished on So Dark The Night , but at the end it boils down to not much more than a gimmick  and not a very good gimmick at that . It 's a one - trick pony of a movie .",431,1,0.0003921568627451458,0.22173518272049383,0.0003921568627451458,0.0003921568627451458,0.014193645164002858,0.0003921568627451458,0.0003921568627451458,0.0003921568627451458,0.033347417325766245,0.0003921568627451458,0.0003921568627451458,0.0003921568627451458,0.0003921568627451458,0.0003921568627451458,0.0003921568627451458,0.0003921568627451458,0.0003921568627451458,0.0003921568627451458,0.0003921568627451458,0.0003921568627451458,0.4073829343320384,0.1628015398106545,0.0003921568627451458,0.0003921568627451458,0.0003921568627451458,0.0003921568627451458,0.0003921568627451458,0.0003921568627451458,0.0003921568627451458,0.0003921568627451458,0.0003921568627451458,0.0003921568627451458,0.059416124379310715,0.0003921568627451458,0.0003921568627451458,0.0003921568627451458,0.0003921568627451458,0.0003921568627451458,0.0003921568627451458,0.0003921568627451458,0.0003921568627451458,0.023591706295399424,0.0003921568627451458,0.06106086173703781,0.0003921568627451458,0.0003921568627451458,0.0003921568627451458,0.0003921568627451458,0.0003921568627451458,0.0003921568627451458,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
35914,0,If you watched this film for the nudity ( as I did ) you wo n't be disappointed . I could have done without the bumbling crooks or the bear though . Some bottomless nudity could have be shown but for what it was I think H.O.T.S. has to be the best of its genre . It is not the sort of film that could have been made today which is a pity because it is the sort of film that is worth watching in these times . I would take mindless nudity over pivotal plot points any day . It is a shame that the DVD does n't have any extras but as they did n't have DVDs when this was filmed that is understandable . I would have like to know more about the shooting of the film especially where they shot the football match at the end .,151,1,0.0007407407407407868,0.0007407407407407868,0.0007407407407407868,0.0007407407407407868,0.0007407407407407868,0.0007407407407407868,0.0007407407407407868,0.0007407407407407868,0.0007407407407407868,0.0007407407407407868,0.0007407407407407868,0.0007407407407407868,0.24115891092855785,0.0007407407407407868,0.0007407407407407868,0.0007407407407407868,0.0007407407407407868,0.06345881942358866,0.0007407407407407868,0.0007407407407407868,0.0007407407407407868,0.0007407407407407868,0.0007407407407407868,0.0007407407407407868,0.0007407407407407868,0.0007407407407407868,0.0007407407407407868,0.0007407407407407868,0.0007407407407407868,0.0007407407407407868,0.0007407407407407868,0.0007407407407407868,0.0007407407407407868,0.0007407407407407868,0.0007407407407407868,0.0007407407407407868,0.0007407407407407868,0.0007407407407407868,0.0007407407407407868,0.0007407407407407868,0.0007407407407407868,0.0007407407407407868,0.0007407407407407868,0.6605674548330365,0.0007407407407407868,0.0007407407407407868,0.0007407407407407868,0.0007407407407407868,0.0007407407407407868,0.0007407407407407868,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

36023,0,"Andreas arrives in a strange , inhuman place , where everything seems perfect . He 's given a good work , everyone is kind to him and to everyone , and he really does n't trouble too much even in finding a beautiful girlfriend . But in this no - named city Andreas finds soon that a perfect commercials - type world is really not a paradise . Really one of the better movies i 've seen this year . The attractive plot is perfectly supported by a smart direction where every single component ( cool desaturated photography ; cold symmetrical design ; unemotional acting ; slow , highly controlled camera movements ) helps in building an unique weird atmosphere that will keep the audience suspended until the end . A sarcastic , ironic , bitter comedy that made me laugh ant think , as only best films are able to do . Nothing new , probably , in the analysis of the modern de - humanizer civilization , but really a smart work with great surprising ideas that will hardly be forgotten from whom had the luck to see it . Simply beautiful the amazing scene in the metro underground .",202,1,0.00043478260869569827,0.00043478260869569827,0.00043478260869569827,0.00043478260869569827,0.039282919844410284,0.00043478260869569827,0.04394628822194671,0.00043478260869569827,0.10994243860900965,0.00043478260869569827,0.00043478260869569827,0.022522383432962687,0.18492571756286408,0.00043478260869569827,0.00043478260869569827,0.00043478260869569827,0.00043478260869569827,0.00043478260869569827,0.00043478260869569827,0.00043478260869569827,0.11393872533179612,0.17057118200073182,0.00043478260869569827,0.00043478260869569827,0.00043478260869569827,0.00043478260869569827,0.00043478260869569827,0.00043478260869569827,0.00043478260869569827,0.00043478260869569827,0.00043478260869569827,0.00043478260869569827,0.00043478260869569827,0.00043478260869569827,0.00043478260869569827,0.00043478260869569827,0.00043478260869569827,0.00043478260869569827,0.00043478260869569827,0.00043478260869569827,0.00043478260869569827,0.00043478260869569827,0.00043478260869569827,0.2966094754310593,0.00043478260869569827,0.00043478260869569827,0.00043478260869569827,0.00043478260869569827,0.00043478260869569827,0.00043478260869569827,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
36377,0,"Like most sports movies , it 's not surprising that people who know something about the sport can find flaws in it . As a soccer referee , I have yet to see a movie or TV show get it right when depicting a match . "" Forever "" has good actors , but I found Sean Astin to be a bit young to be an administrator in a juvenile jail . I was very thankful that the plot did not involve the lead character turning his fellow inmates into rugby players and taking on Flagstaff as well as Highland . Which gets to credulity : a police squad car just happens to pull up at precisely the time the Flagstaff baddies are hazing Rick Penning . Even though rugby is not a sanctioned high school sport nationally , the team is a school - based club sport -- much like rodeo . That said , I find it hard to believe that high school officials would allow students to play with open wounds : That just is n't done in this day of AIDS and Hepatitis . I do n't care what the tradition and macho image is . Despite that , it was a cool movie in that teens were expected to act like adults ( and sometimes actually did ) . Sadly , far too many coaches are like Flagstaff 's -- or worse .",238,1,0.00045454545454549515,0.00045454545454549515,0.00045454545454549515,0.00045454545454549515,0.00045454545454549515,0.00045454545454549515,0.023181818319383915,0.00045454545454549515,0.00045454545454549515,0.00045454545454549515,0.00045454545454549515,0.00045454545454549515,0.13460143819121106,0.00045454545454549515,0.00045454545454549515,0.00045454545454549515,0.00045454545454549515,0.00045454545454549515,0.00045454545454549515,0.023393481800642057,0.5715328067015922,0.00045454545454549515,0.00045454545454549515,0.00045454545454549515,0.00045454545454549515,0.1612631463816089,0.00045454545454549515,0.00045454545454549515,0.00045454545454549515,0.0272048245085919,0.00045454545454549515,0.00045454545454549515,0.03927702955151353,0.00045454545454549515,0.00045454545454549515,0.00045454545454549515,0.00045454545454549515,0.00045454545454549515,0.00045454545454549515,0.00045454545454549515,0.00045454545454549515,0.00045454545454549515,0.00045454545454549515,0.00045454545454549515,0.00045454545454549515,0.00045454545454549515,0.00045454545454549515,0.00045454545454549515,0.00045454545454549515,0.00045454545454549515,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
36408,0,"In England we often feel very attached to British films that we like , as we are so used to the usual American settings and accents . Being from London , where Virtual Sexuality is set , I felt a strong emotional attachment to it . The characters in Virtual Sexuality , particularly the females , are exactly what British teenagers are like , I felt like I was almost in the film . I immediately related to the character of Alex from the film , his shyness is quite common in most British teenage boys , especially around girls . Virtual Sexuality made me feel really good as its one of the only British films that is n't about gangsters or the middle - upper class , but about the people who are watching the film , average teenagers . Americans would n't really feel the emotional attachment , but every British teenager should watch it . Anyone from London will recognise the parts of the city from the film , it 's definately got a special place in my video box !",184,1,0.15300322299732644,0.0005128205128205559,0.0005128205128205559,0.0005128205128205559,0.0005128205128205559,0.0005128205128205559,0.026153846299789257,0.0005128205128205559,0.0005128205128205559,0.0005128205128205559,0.0005128205128205559,0.0005128205128205559,0.0005128205128205559,0.0005128205128205559,0.0005128205128205559,0.0005128205128205559,0.06553956276075587,0.0005128205128205559,0.0005128205128205559,0.0005128205128205559,0.0005128205128205559,0.15280520801469633,0.0005128205128205559,0.0005128205128205559,0.0005128205128205559,0.02468169701361762,0.03375530274752857,0.0005128205128205559,0.0005128205128205559,0.033347827436712475,0.0005128205128205559,0.02832899140796012,0.0005128205128205559,0.0005128205128205559,0.0005128205128205559,0.0005128205128205559,0.0005128205128205559,0.0005128205128205559,0.0005128205128205559,0.0005128205128205559,0.0005128205128205559,0.0005128205128205559,0.0005128205128205559,0.4287278344047211,0.0005128205128205559,0.03314368640406988,0.0005128205128205559,0.0005128205128205559,0.0005128205128205559,0.0005128205128205559,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0

36567,0,"American war movie fans might be bored out of their skulls by this movie , but that boredom is born of ignorance . Guerrilla suppression operations are always like that . Sit around and wait , get some hookers , get drunk at the base , wheel and deal with the businessman , kick a prisoner around , cover up the killing of the street merchant by the green private . Then , boom , there goes two fuel trucks , and for 10 minutes a small - arms battle with one high - caliber machine gun . Then wait for brass to plan a way to knock out their stronghold , and then end up killing a few civilians in the process of doing it . If reality does n't work for Western viewers , there 's always Top Gun or Rambo ( Top Gun realistic ? nope)The best part of Afganskiy Izlom 's realism was the way all the planes dropped flares like confetti . They had to do that because Carter and Reagan gave the Mujahedin so many missiles . Also , the wave of Mi-24 's was excellent , a better helo attack even than Apocalypse now . The sight of their missiles dropping and shooting was a scene of impending "" death from above "" for whoever they were aimed at . It 's funny how the Soviets were able to make an honest Afghanistan movie within a year after their departure , but it took the US six years . Afganskiy Izlom is just as real if you apply it to NATO 's occupation too . Someone will always pick up the gun and shoot you cause they care more about the land . It 's a movie Westerners should watch . Unfortunately I do n't think anyone has ever made English subtitles ; I might have to make some .",317,1,0.00045454545454549374,0.00045454545454549374,0.00045454545454549374,0.01899341185135503,0.07223143583271213,0.023336039157443155,0.00045454545454549374,0.00045454545454549374,0.00045454545454549374,0.00045454545454549374,0.03145872468379215,0.00045454545454549374,0.05908056026015274,0.00045454545454549374,0.00045454545454549374,0.00045454545454549374,0.00045454545454549374,0.00045454545454549374,0.023179995634234087,0.00045454545454549374,0.4603468892777843,0.00045454545454549374,0.00045454545454549374,0.05973751777898349,0.024169775043980154,0.00045454545454549374,0.00045454545454549374,0.00045454545454549374,0.00045454545454549374,0.00045454545454549374,0.00045454545454549374,0.045909090909980466,0.04619449170464734,0.00045454545454549374,0.00045454545454549374,0.00045454545454549374,0.00045454545454549374,0.02335510421985032,0.053026871690286095,0.00045454545454549374,0.042616455591160715,0.00045454545454549374,0.00045454545454549374,0.00045454545454549374,0.00045454545454549374,0.00045454545454549374,0.00045454545454549374,0.00045454545454549374,0.00045454545454549374,0.00045454545454549374,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Renying Zhou as Doggie was amazing -- very natural talent , and Xu Zhu was a delight - very believable as the jaded old traditionalist . The soundtrack was very effective , guiding without being overwhelming .

37576,0,"This movie was excellent . A sad truth to how culture tends to clash with the sexes . This is just one big warm fuzzy type of movie . You have the master who is steeped in tradition and kind hearted in his own way , Doggie despite being a girl thing to win his affections and you top it off with one cute monkey with a thousand facial expressions . This equals on big happy movie in the end . This movie does a good job at showing how steeped in tradition one can be , so steeped that they are willing to die without sharing their secrets . You see sides to a culture never seen before which helps enhance the drama that unfolds near the end of the picture . The cinema - photography is excellent , in particular the opening parade sequence with all the sparkers .

37940,0,"This was usually producer Alexander Korda 's advice on set to many of his underlings ; the film is credited with three directors but in truth Alex , Zoltan Korda and William Cameron Menzies helped out , pushing it to six . For John Kobal 's 1987 book , "" The Top 100 Movies "" , his survey of 81 film critics saw The Thief of Bagdad reach 55th place . A closer examination reveals only Jose Luis Guarner , John Russell Taylor and Kobal himself actually voted for the picture , but their high placings were enough to take it to near the half - way mark . The outbreak of the Second World War saw the movie 's production shifted around England and America , eventually seeing completion in 1940 and winning three technical Oscars . Like Citizen Kane , it is in some ways perhaps a film you might admire rather than love . The special effects , outstanding for the time , are still reasonable , and actually hold up if you squint . But it 's not so much their effectiveness as the audacity of the inventions . Among them is an amusing horse , constructed out of a kit model , which , when a key is inserted up it 's rear end , begins to fly . There 's also a killer toy of the six - armed Goddess Kali , ( perhaps quite obviously a single woman with two women sitting behind her ) and a quite horrific - looking giant spider . Also impressing is the climax with its wonderful flying carpet . But most memorable has to be Rex Ingram appearing as , in a superb moment of cinematic conceit , a djinn ( genie ) nearly a thousand feet tall ! Ingram portrays the genie as quite a menacing creature , and adds an element of danger to the proceedings . And look out for the moment where he 's tricked back into his bottle!John Justin does well as the Arabic king who , for some strange reason , has an English accent and a stiff upper lip . Sabu , the astonishingly muscled 15year - old , is near - namesake Abu , a likeably cocky thief . After they cross paths with the evil Jaffer ( Conrad Veidt ) , Justin finds himself blind and Abu is turned into a dog . When it seems the rest of the film will be told in flashback through the blind Ahmed 's ( Justin 's ) perspective , we find that halfway through the movie we catch up to the present and the adventure continues . In truth , the second half is someway the better , being full of greater incident and more fantastical in nature . Three small songs pepper the piece , though as the film lasts for 100 minutes this feels more like mild flavouring rather than a real ingredient ; I would n't classify this as a musical . It 's all great fun ; Justin and June Duprez are the love interest for the mums and dads , Veidt is the boo - hiss villain , and Abu is the youthful , irrepressible robber . It may take a while to get into the somewhat dated mindset and overblown melodrama of 40s English movies , but once you 've sat through the first half an hour or so this film really draws you in . Quite commendable .",585,1,0.00026666666666669216,0.09160863922161895,0.00026666666666669216,0.017347849213429276,0.00026666666666669216,0.00026666666666669216,0.029586709104352335,0.14413296718720686,0.00026666666666669216,0.00026666666666669216,0.00026666666666669216,0.014024364226555794,0.00026666666666669216,0.00026666666666669216,0.05302432224561322,0.00026666666666669216,0.00026666666666669216,0.00026666666666669216,0.013595146056986477,0.00026666666666669216,0.2678612999238316,0.00026666666666669216,0.00026666666666669216,0.02463934381017971,0.00026666666666669216,0.06338769461095711,0.00026666666666669216,0.00026666666666669216,0.00026666666666669216,0.00026666666666669216,0.00026666666666669216,0.014177677047660188,0.00026666666666669216,0.00026666666666669216,0.00026666666666669216,0.00026666666666669216,0.018055484323610357,0.026933333330014502,0.00026666666666669216,0.00026666666666669216,0.00026666666666669216,0.00026666666666669216,0.00026666666666669216,0.21202516969798285,0.00026666666666669216,0.00026666666666669216,0.00026666666666669216,0.00026666666666669216,0.00026666666666669216,0.00026666666666669216,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
37990,0,"This movie is intelligent . That is , more than most other movies , it transcends the least common denominator - stupid people will probably not appreciate it . The story also relies heavily on dialogue . It has some parallels to Lost in Translation , although Before Sunrise is much brighter , somehow less abstract , and simply a lot better . The script , the characters and even the slightly surreal atmosphere feel totally realistic . The actors play absolutely brilliantly . Rarely have I seen a movie where the script and the acting has melted this perfectly together . The dialogue moves into very personal issues , with the risk of becoming a little over the top . It does , however , stay on the right side almost all the time , although I found a few moments a little awkward and embarrassing . Balancing on this fine line demands outrageously talented actors . Sometimes , it yields great results , and overall this movie is simply stupendous ! Only very , very rarely is "" love "" in films depicted in a way that I find trustworthy and realistic . Every time that is achieved , the result is fantastic . I think the stunning and apparently timeless beauty of the female lead actress helped quite a bit in this respect . She still looks stunning in this film , 12 years after . This is simply a gem of a movie that you ca n't miss .

38247,0,"Anyone who has seen this movie and reviewed it poorly , I would refer them to Roger Ebert 's review of this movie . He is one of the most respected Critics in the industry , and he gave it 3 1/2 Stars . This is a great movie . It may not be perfect , or spectacular , but I enjoyed it . A Chorus Line is not so much a story , as it is a group of stories about the lives of Broadway hopefuls . I read reviews where people said that too much time was wasted on the romance between Zach and Cassie . That is an incorrect view . It is another story along with all the other stories that are told about each of the Broadway hopefuls . What people fail to realize is that those who are dancers for Broadway shows go through the same things that the common man goes through . And that I think is really the point of the whole show . It is to showcase not only the talent of these special dancers , but to give us some poignant things to think about in regard to life in general . This is a study of life as a Broadway star . Anyone who has dreamed of becoming a Broadway star watches this movie with a great feeling of relationship because they have gone through exactly what the characters are going through . This is a great musical . It has its slow points , and at times gets a little confused with the pacing of certain story lines , but all in all , I thoroughly enjoyed it . Take a closer look at the movie , and then maybe you will understand what I am talking about .",302,1,0.000350877192982482,0.000350877192982482,0.000350877192982482,0.000350877192982482,0.05248457464161213,0.000350877192982482,0.018231334296964226,0.15560866882241436,0.000350877192982482,0.000350877192982482,0.000350877192982482,0.000350877192982482,0.000350877192982482,0.000350877192982482,0.000350877192982482,0.000350877192982482,0.000350877192982482,0.000350877192982482,0.000350877192982482,0.000350877192982482,0.3119261857323673,0.000350877192982482,0.000350877192982482,0.000350877192982482,0.000350877192982482,0.000350877192982482,0.10666309382334047,0.000350877192982482,0.000350877192982482,0.000350877192982482,0.000350877192982482,0.000350877192982482,0.000350877192982482,0.000350877192982482,0.2075443801945181,0.000350877192982482,0.028447441732030298,0.000350877192982482,0.000350877192982482,0.000350877192982482,0.000350877192982482,0.000350877192982482,0.000350877192982482,0.000350877192982482,0.1043574786514887,0.000350877192982482,0.000350877192982482,0.000350877192982482,0.000350877192982482,0.000350877192982482,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

You watch as John lives through the last couple months of his life . You watch as he goes through his days with a positive attitude . At one point you begin to see that he is truly an amazing individual . You begin to understand that he has something to teach all of us .

38718,0,"Based on Elmore Leonard , this is a violent and intelligent action film . The story : a business man is blackmailed by some 3 criminals . Roy Schieder does great job as the leading character and special credit 's got to go to John Glover who plays sort of a naughty psychopath . I must mention that the villains characters are very complex and interesting - something that is very rare for an action film . also features some beautiful and sexy women - most notable are Kelly Preston as the young bate for Schieder 's character . Vanity gives a very good performance and appearance as the hooker who is connected with the three blackmailers . I 'm glad to say that Ann - Margaret still has n't lost it - this lady is a true babe . Do n't look at the rate of this film . I really do n't know what the public and some critics have against this film but my suggestion is to ignore them and watch this truly gripping and under - rated film .

A daring film for its time , and a foremost example of the kind of gritty landscape being explored in the more graphic films of the ' 60s . Symbolic of the "" end of innocence "" in American films , since it was the only X - rated film to win a Best Picture Oscar . JON VOIGT is the male hustler who comes to the big city expecting to find women an easy way to make money when they fight over his body , but soon finds the city is a cold place with no welcome mat for his ilk . Befriended by a lame con - man ( DUSTIN Hoffman ) , he goes through a series of serio - comic adventures that leave him disillusioned and bitter , ready to leave the confines of a cold water flat for the sunshine promised in Florida , a land his friend "" Ratzo "" dreams of living in . But even in this final quest , the two are losers . John Schlesinger has directed with finesse from a brilliant script by Waldo Salt , and John Barry 's haunting "" Midnight Cowboy "" theme adds to the poignant moments of search and desperation .

38768,0,"John Schlesinger 's ' Midnight Cowboy ' is perhaps most notable for being the only X - rated film in Academy history to receive the Oscar for Best Picture . This was certainly how I first came to hear of it , and , to be completely honest , I did n't really expect much of the film . This is not to say that I thought it would be horrible , but somehow I did n't consider it the sort of movie that I would enjoy watching . This is one reason why you should never trust your own instincts on such manners  a remarkable combination of stellar acting , ambitious directing and a memorable soundtrack ( "" Everybody 's talking ' at me , I do n't hear a word they 're sayin ' "" ) make this film one of the finest explorations of life , naivety and friendship ever released . Young Joe Buck ( then - newcomer Jon Voight ) , dressed proudly as a rodeo cowboy , travels from Texas to New York to seek a new life as a hustler , a male prostitute . Women , however , do not seem to be willing to pay money for his services , and Joe faces living in extreme poverty as his supply of money begins to dry up . During these exploits , Joe comes to meet Enrico "" Ratso "" Rizzo ( Dustin Hoffman ) , a sickly crippled swindler who initially tries to con Joe out of all his money . When they come to realise that they are both in the same predicament , Ratso offers Joe a place to stay , and , working together , they attempt to make ( largely dishonest ) lives for themselves in the cold , gritty metropolis of New York . Joe had convinced himself that New York women would be more than willing to pay for sex ; however , his first such business venture ends with him guiltily paying the woman ( Sylvia Miles ) twenty dollars . Though he might consider himself to be somewhat intelligent , Ratso is just as naïve as Joe . Ratso , with his painful limp and hacking cough , is always assuring himself that , if only he could travel to the warmth of Miami , somehow everything would be all right . This misguided expectation that things will get better so easily is quite reminiscent of Lennie and George of John Steinbeck 's classic novel , ' Of Mice and Men . 'Shot largely on the streets of New York , ' Midnight Cowboy ' is a grittily - realistic look at life in the slums . Watching the film , we can almost feel ourselves inside Ratso 's squalid , unheated residence , our joints stiff from the aching winter cold . The acting certainly contributes to this ultra - realism , with both Voight and Hoffman masterfully portraying the two decadent dregs of modern society . Hoffman , in particular , is exceptional in his role ( I 'm walkin ' here ! I 'm walkin ' here ! "" ) , managing to steer well clear of being typecast after his much - lauded debut in 1967 's ' The Graduate . ' Both stars were later nominated for Best Actor Oscars ( also nominated for acting  bafflingly  was Sylvia Miles , for an appearance that ca n't have been for more than five minutes ) , though both ultimately lost out to John Wayne in ' True Grit . ' ' Midnight Cowboy ' eventually went on to win three Oscars from seven nominations , including Best Picture , Best Director for Schlesinger and Best Writing for Waldo Salt . 'Midnight Cowboy ' is told mainly in a linear fashion , though there are numerous flashbacks that hint at Joe 's past . Rather than explicitly explaining what these brief snippets are actually about , the audience is invited to think about it for themselves , and how these circumstances could have led Joe onto the path he is now pursuing . The achingly - beautiful final scene leaves us with a glimmer of hope , but a large amount of uncertainty . Gritty , thought - provoking and intensely fascinating , ' Midnight Cowboy ' is one for the ages .",736,1,0.00019230769230771573,0.13745355546771507,0.00019230769230771573,0.00019230769230771573,0.00019230769230771573,0.00019230769230771573,0.00019230769230771573,0.2654828720996402,0.00019230769230771573,0.00019230769230771573,0.00019230769230771573,0.00019230769230771573,0.00019230769230771573,0.00019230769230771573,0.00019230769230771573,0.00019230769230771573,0.00019230769230771573,0.00019230769230771573,0.00980232707478886,0.00019230769230771573,0.17253949321670034,0.00019230769230771573,0.00019230769230771573,0.00019230769230771573,0.00019230769230771573,0.00019230769230771573,0.04620027937069284,0.00019230769230771573,0.00019230769230771573,0.013974312071888723,0.00019230769230771573,0.00019230769230771573,0.030116374849059917,0.00019230769230771573,0.00019230769230771573,0.00019230769230771573,0.019914995695547614,0.00019230769230771573,0.00019230769230771573,0.038757049011958145,0.00019230769230771573,0.00019230769230771573,0.00019230769230771573,0.2580664334496997,0.00019230769230771573,0.00019230769230771573,0.00019230769230771573,0.00019230769230771573,0.00019230769230771573,0.00019230769230771573,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

I can tell its all stock Trek OST stuff and works most of the time , but timing can fall flat now & then ( the end of "" Worst Fears Part 2 "" misses the crunch , and the edit .

38971,0,"Fate / Stay Night is an animated series inspired by a h - game . Somehow the producers turned it around making this a successful series without any of the h - stuff . It could n't have been any other way because the development of the characters is great just the way it 's pictured in this series and any alteration of that could only ruin perfection.(You'll understand once you see all the episodes).Despite a relatively slow start ( the producer took his time on presenting the characters ) things gain momentum quickly and soon after mid - series the action gets so intense that glues you to your seat . The topic of the series concentrates on the War of Holy Grail that has been taking place in the Fukuky City for the last 50 years . The pilot actually starts with the conclusion of the previous war and develops from there on . Shiro is the only survivor of the fire that started during the last battle and enveloped a large portion of the city . He unwillingly witnesses a fight between two Servants that triggers his Reiju ( Holy mark ) to summon one of the most powerful Servants of the battlefield , Saber . His first contact with Saber left him stunned "" Such immeasurable beauty ... I was at a lost for words "" . You must n't compare this series with any other to fully understand it 's plot . FSN offers much more than some cool sword fights , good animation , spectacular lights , great soundtrack , it offers excellent character and relationship development . It presents the changes that take place within the characters personalities as the events precipitate . The action reveals believable dynamic emotional and behavioral patterns of the individuals ( not similar to the linear type other series use ) that are constantly shaping their personalities to reveal , from under the mask of perfection , flawed characters . The Saber character is tied to a medieval legend that has been altered to fit this series and should be accepted as such . You should n't watch FSN thinking that it does n't present the viewer with the historic fact , just remember that this is adventure / fantasy series and not a documentary and enjoy this as long as you can . The ending is sudden and unexpected and if there were twice as many episodes I would have watched them in the same breath .",420,1,0.1309553658036203,0.14739276296946988,0.0002816901408451004,0.0002816901408451004,0.015524061526096016,0.0002816901408451004,0.014463866219528753,0.0002816901408451004,0.0002816901408451004,0.0002816901408451004,0.0002816901408451004,0.0002816901408451004,0.0002816901408451004,0.0002816901408451004,0.0002816901408451004,0.0002816901408451004,0.0002816901408451004,0.0002816901408451004,0.0002816901408451004,0.0002816901408451004,0.0002816901408451004,0.12082516618821518,0.0002816901408451004,0.1939406052360994,0.03722555700378038,0.0002816901408451004,0.0002816901408451004,0.0002816901408451004,0.0002816901408451004,0.0002816901408451004,0.0002816901408451004,0.03094666444952355,0.0002816901408451004,0.0002816901408451004,0.12320219735566218,0.0002816901408451004,0.0002816901408451004,0.0002816901408451004,0.022124016180590903,0.0002816901408451004,0.08645073280895728,0.0002816901408451004,0.0002816901408451004,0.0002816901408451004,0.033737094989938154,0.0002816901408451004,0.03278937405724976,0.0002816901408451004,0.0002816901408451004,0.0002816901408451004,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0
39150,0,"Zero Day leads you to think , even re - think why two boys / young men would do what they did - commit mutual suicide via slaughtering their classmates . It captures what must be beyond a bizarre mode of being for two humans who have decided to withdraw from common civility in order to define their own / mutual world via coupled destruction . It is not a perfect movie but given what money / time the filmmaker and actors had - it is a remarkable product . In terms of explaining the motives and actions of the two young suicide / murderers it is better than ' Elephant ' - in terms of being a film that gets under our ' rationalistic ' skin it is a far , far better film than almost anything you are likely to see .

I mean Rock was hilarious in the movie and the whole switching with the racial stuff breaks a little barriers which is great . Also the thought of how the movie goes is a nice way of thinking .

39793,0,"The Woman in Black ( 1989 ) is a TV adaptation of Susan Hill 's modern classic ghost story , published only a few years earlier than the film was made . Sadly , this film has not been released on DVD , and as far as I am aware it has been deleted on VHS . It 's availability is in direct contrast to it 's popularity amongst those in the know about horror films . The story revolves around events in a seaside community in the early 20th century where a young solicitor is sent by his firm to conclude the affairs of a recently deceased widow , who died on her isolated marshland estate . What he thought would be a routine and probably tedious task turns into a nightmare as he discovers that the old woman was haunted to her death , and that the ghosts of her past are not content to rest . The story is told in a subtle but concise way , never being self - indulgent , flashy or over - expositional . The obviously tight budget may have contributed to the no - nonsense approach , but it 's just what the story needs , and why it works so well . It 's what you do n't see that scares . Having said that , there is one particularly terrifying scene that relies on the visual , and it works to perfection . I watched this film during the day , and it still gave me nightmares nearly a week later . If you love being terrified , do what you must to get hold of and watch a copy of The Woman In Black .",287,1,0.0003921568627451338,0.0003921568627451338,0.0003921568627451338,0.02490825054336413,0.0003921568627451338,0.0003921568627451338,0.0003921568627451338,0.05827045467998323,0.0003921568627451338,0.0003921568627451338,0.0003921568627451338,0.0003921568627451338,0.0003921568627451338,0.0003921568627451338,0.0003921568627451338,0.0003921568627451338,0.0003921568627451338,0.0003921568627451338,0.0003921568627451338,0.0003921568627451338,0.0003921568627451338,0.0003921568627451338,0.0003921568627451338,0.04537343651334015,0.022063376799553697,0.0003921568627451338,0.06601867479015462,0.0003921568627451338,0.0003921568627451338,0.04372941929993291,0.0003921568627451338,0.0003921568627451338,0.0003921568627451338,0.0003921568627451338,0.048942099777587025,0.10770460870829544,0.0003921568627451338,0.0003921568627451338,0.0003921568627451338,0.0003921568627451338,0.02694914521654869,0.0003921568627451338,0.0003921568627451338,0.47050870626805014,0.0003921568627451338,0.07023770975612972,0.0003921568627451338,0.0003921568627451338,0.0003921568627451338,0.0003921568627451338,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0

39876,0,"Several features of this film immediately date it . The sound is rather shrill and one realizes what great strides have been accomplished in sound reproduction in the ensuing years . The language of the dialogue is rather quaint and unnatural and the acting is still reminiscent of its transition from the stage techniques . Bette Davis always gives a strong performance in all her films as she does in this early period of her very successful career . I do feel however that somehow the cockney accent does not fit the facial expression . I think it is the assumed cockney accent that does not ring true for me . Somerset Maughan loves to delve into human relationships of great dramatic intensity which will please all movie - goers . As in so many of her character roles , Bette Davis can switch from a beautiful seductive woman to a viper full of fiery hatred . Leslie Howard is well cast as the withdrawn English artist with a club foot desperately seeking a partner and making a bad choice in a scheming little waitress . Towards the end of the film the young doctor meets his true love in a busy street . They cross through the traffic completely oblivious to a multitude of horns and whistles screaming at them . This scene is possibly meant to be funny , but i find it quite ridiculous in this otherwise very serious film . It is probably construed to send you home with a smile on your face . And after all as far as we can see ( and hope for ) it is a happy ending .",279,1,0.0004000000000000339,0.0004000000000000339,0.0004000000000000339,0.0004000000000000339,0.034564498547335246,0.0004000000000000339,0.0004000000000000339,0.08887139477384125,0.0004000000000000339,0.0004000000000000339,0.0004000000000000339,0.0004000000000000339,0.0004000000000000339,0.0004000000000000339,0.0004000000000000339,0.0004000000000000339,0.04522253141387716,0.0004000000000000339,0.0004000000000000339,0.0004000000000000339,0.1001552968712648,0.0004000000000000339,0.0004000000000000339,0.02049162326491973,0.021324040912097168,0.0004000000000000339,0.03171139126535972,0.0004000000000000339,0.04040000000000242,0.0004000000000000339,0.0004000000000000339,0.0004000000000000339,0.0004000000000000339,0.0004000000000000339,0.0684697205669221,0.0004000000000000339,0.0004000000000000339,0.04071476946165747,0.0004000000000000339,0.0004000000000000339,0.022967177444807047,0.0004000000000000339,0.0004000000000000339,0.46990755547791446,0.0004000000000000339,0.0004000000000000339,0.0004000000000000339,0.0004000000000000339,0.0004000000000000339,0.0004000000000000339,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

40358,0,"Beat a path to this important documentary that looks like an attractive feature . Forbidden Lie$(2007 ) is simply a better ( cinematic ) version of Norma Khouri 's book Forbidden Love , and THAT was a best - seller . An onion - peeling of literary fraud and of a pretty woman , Lie$ is the very best in editorialised reality TV.Cleverly edited and colourful , Broinowski 's storytelling is chaptered by moving silhouettes of Norma Khouri meaningfully blowing smoke . I disagree ( with Variety ) that it 's overlong ; instead my one slight problem was with the episodic nature of its key players commenting on others ' just - recorded testimonials . On a single watching your sense of narrative becomes mired ..... so I watched it twice . This Oscar - worthy effort is at once genuinely funny , upsetting , and totally engrossing as it documents one lie after another . The apparent con unfolded in the Australian State of Queensland via very personal swindles of Khouri 's friends and fans ( ! ) . Clearly these friends are now "" turned "" , the funniest on - camera line belonging to Khouri 's QLD neighbour Rachel Richardson who speaks her disillusionment in flat , no - nonsense colloquialisms : "" I think it 's a load of sh!t . Personally"" . We need to learn from their experience , hence my belief in spoilers . Any perennial lie - spinner caught out in a lie will just say anything to buy time to tell another lie . There 's some breathtaking footage of Khouri cackling derisively at duping this very documentarian , who instead presses her ( con)""Artist "" repeatedly for corroboration . Since being busted by Sydney Morning Herald journalists Caroline Overington and David Knox a year after publication , Khouri has been on the run , but was tempted back to the director to supposedly clear her name . She absconded supposedly because a ) she 's either terrified of her sly , more - Italian - sounding - than - Greek husband , or b ) because she needed her passport / visas to clear her name . Unlikely . A more plausible reason was that the FBI regained her trail in Queensland before she again skipped overseas ( one guess : No , not Jordan ) . According to a closing card , Khouri is "" still under investigation by the FBI "" in 2007.I guessed audiences might just give Khouri the benefit of the doubt once she invoked the need for utmost secrecy and subterfuge . Instead , the audiences I sat with slowly became just as disillusioned as the duped people on the screen . Once they caught on , there was plenty counter - derision and catcalls ; earlier , stressed sighs had emanated from audiencemembers who just did n't know how to take Khouri 's evolving contradictions . The filmmaker gets props for so beautifully spanning this convoluted tale from beginning to end , not leaving anything out -- not even her own self - sacrifice . Anna opens her film with a sympathetic book narration by Khouri herself . The putated reason for authoring it is retold very believably at first -- key to how a lifelong liar operates : in half - truths . Khouri is nevertheless a very pretty and smart 35yr - old with rather disarming charm , and surprisingly , worked - out biceps . Gradually we 're introduced to less - and - less - adulating Aussie journos , publishers and fans who at first bought the extent of Khouri 's honour - killing accusations hook , line and sinker . Later we see their more rueful reactions , quite self - controlled and matter - of - fact , if some perhaps a little bitter . It was Jordanian ( anti-)honour - killing activists who took deepest umbrage at Khouri 's fallacies because its pot - stirring forced them to reduce the pace of change . Honour - killings do happen in Jordan ; it 's just their prevalence that 's at odds with Khouri 's book -- plus 72 other "" facts "" . In 2003 these activists faxed ( Australian ) Random House with 73 painstakingly - checked objections . The publishing houses across 4 continents who 'd jumped at the chance to publish first - time author Khouri never tried to check any facts . Leaving any corroborration to a disclaimer in their author contract , they too were fair game . So a massive hot - topic fraud was as easy to perpetrate upon the world as typing it up in Internet cafes . Later still we 're shocked to discover that the "" factual errors "" extend to Khouri 's bio as well . For one thing , she 's not only not a 35yr - old virgin ( her defence is that she merely did n't disabuse people of their assumptions ) , but she has a slickster husband and 2 teenagers ! Sometimes she 's just too fast - talking in her American accent . She also seems too - comfortable with cellphone technology and Western clothes . I realise observations like these might sound prejudicial to the very Jordanian women who do n't need any Western paternalism from me , but when even cultural cues do n't jibe in addition to Khouri 's "" facts "" , you 've got to start questioning your source . At some point the filmmaker came to the same conclusion . She makes an admirable effort to hold Khouri to account , in person , in Jordan . The last third is consumed with a fact - finding trip back to Amman , where one "" fact "" after another falls . Eventually Broinowski forces her ( con)""Artist "" to admit the decade - discrepancy in her story , and it 's after this that Khouri records her derisive secret confession into her own digital camera . Secret , because in it Khouri 's "" American security guard "" Jeremy is heard to have an Australian accent : he 's an actor ! ( We never find out how Anna uncovered it . ) So this becomes the filmmaker 's triumph , as she never flags in her tone or commitment . Her on - camera revelations lead her audience to learn from the mistakes of others given such a litany of reasonable doubt , FBI documents -- and Khouri 's most shocking initial crime . Anna Broinowski ( watch - list her now ) is even clever enough to use the one artistic device ( key players cross - commenting on footage ) to kill two birds -- making her audiences want to drink from the same well again . In fact , despite her deceptively demure approach , she made me re - confirm that Overington and Knox really DID win their 2004 Walkleys in Investigate Journalism for their "" Norma Khouri Investigation"" . Broinowski MADE ME LOOK.(10/10 )",1187,1,0.12743251606244524,0.00014285714285716146,0.00014285714285716146,0.02239489856595166,0.00014285714285716146,0.00014285714285716146,0.00014285714285716146,0.03479749678572742,0.014226190583826457,0.00014285714285716146,0.00014285714285716146,0.00014285714285716146,0.17884284748414536,0.00014285714285716146,0.007553426122266842,0.00014285714285716146,0.00014285714285716146,0.018381109267750287,0.00014285714285716146,0.008934350445723735,0.00014285714285716146,0.00014285714285716146,0.00014285714285716146,0.051800257433313374,0.00014285714285716146,0.013199080565956783,0.06178765576256453,0.00014285714285716146,0.007880200467868378,0.00014285714285716146,0.00014285714285716146,0.018269437622800425,0.00014285714285716146,0.00014285714285716146,0.00014285714285716146,0.00014285714285716146,0.10529757618263061,0.00014285714285716146,0.05412533277059418,0.00014285714285716146,0.00014285714285716146,0.00014285714285716146,0.045362286689660546,0.16857163025887134,0.00014285714285716146,0.00014285714285716146,0.056572278356473445,0.00014285714285716146,0.00014285714285716146,0.00014285714285716146,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0

40691,0,"Harman and Isings ' Old Mill Pond ' is a true masterpiece of the art of animation . The consummate skill and artistry that characterise this duos work is nowhere more in evidence than in this cartoon . It is a shame that so many people can see only offence in what is , and was always intended to be , a light hearted piece of entertainment that in no way sought to denigrate black people . If anything it is a tribute to the infectious humour and musicality of the black race . I have not been able to view this confection for many years as the ' race commissars ' in England have deemed it too offensive to be shown in multi racial Britain . If anyone knows where I can obtain a copy I would dearly love to view this masterpiece again .

Meanwhile Ann 's daughters , the insecure and unstable Nina Mars ( Toni Collette ) and the happy wife and mother Constance Haverford ( Natasha Richardson ) , are worried with their mother and have differences to be resolved . ""Evening "" has one of the best feminine casts I have ever seen in a movie , with magnificent performances . The resemblance of the stunning Mamie Gummer with her mother Meryl Streep is amazing and she has a performance that honors the name of her mother . The locations , costumes , set decoration , cinematography and soundtrack are also awesome . Unfortunately the plot is confused and I have not clearly understood the message of this film . Why motherhood is so important in the story ? Was Constance engendered in the night stand of Ann and Harris and he would be her father ? Why Ann and Harris have not stayed together , if the guy really loved her like he confesses in their occasional encounter in New York ? Which issues Ann Lord has resolved after the visit of Lila Ross ? Was Buddy Wittenborn bisexual or his love for Harris was a fraternal love ? Why Nina Mars changed her thoughts about motherhood in the end ? It seems that the screenplay writers or the director failed since they were not able to make sense and fulfillment to the beautiful love story . My vote is seven .

41011,0,"I had seen Marion Davies in a couple of movies and really could n't understand her appeal . She could n't dance for peanuts , she did n't attempt to sing and as for her acting - she seemed in a trance . But I had n't seen her silent comedies and this film is wonderful . Rather than kidding her own image , as has been suggested here , to me it seems a satire on Gloria Swanson , who did start off in slapstick comedies , went on to highly emotional women 's pictures and did end up marrying a Count . Marion , a top mimic , also did a funny rabbit imitation whenever she wanted to be seen as grand , that was Gloria Swanson spot on!!!Colonel Pepper ( Dell Henderson ) has motored all the way from Georgia to Hollywood , determined to prove that his daughter , Peggy , ( Marion Davies ) will be the greatest star ever . Their hope dwindles and they are down to their last 40 cents when they meet Billy Boone ( William Haines ) who works at the slapstick studios and promises to get Peggy a job . Peggy thinks she is going to be a great dramatic actress but the studio think she is a fantastic comic . They convince her to make the film and at the preview she is a great success . Charlie Chaplin asks for her autograph but she does n't recognise him and treats him pretty rudely . "" Who was that short little guy "" - when she finds out she faints ! ! ! Peggy and Billy get a call from High Art Studio but only Peggy is wanted and suddenly she is on her way . There is a funny scene where she sees a star she does n't think much of - it 's Marion Davies!!!She finally gets a chance of being a dramatic actress - but she ca n't cry ! ! ! It is a hilarious scene as the director tries everything to get her to cry and when he succeeds , she ca n't stop ! ! ! Her new leading man , Andre ( Paul Ralli ) convinces her to forget her comedy past and become elite and sophisticated - she even adopts a new name - Patricia Pepoire ! ! ! She also seems to have forgotten Billy and her dad - she has developed a "" STAR "" personality ! ! ! When the slapstick studio picks the same location as "" Patricia 's "" movie , Billy is thrilled to see her but quite unprepared for her snobby attitude . When she calls him a cheap clown he realises that she is not the girl he once knew . After a studio luncheon ( a magnificent panning shot of some of the greatest stars of the day ) "" Patricia "" gets a call from the Boss . It seems her films are a flop and no theatres want to book them - the public are tired of her mannerisms and want the old Peggy back . She and Andre decide to get married , she dreams of being a Countess ( even though Billy says that Andre used to serve him spaghetti in a little cafe downtown and is no more a Count than he is ) . On her wedding day , Billy visits and after a hilarious custard pie fight she realises that Billy is the one for her . It was amazing to see all the guest stars - John Gilbert is seen going through the MGM gates , Lew Cody is talking to Elinor Glynn , who not only wrote "" It "" but several racy romances that were made into MGM movies . William Haines , another actor whose movies I had always wanted to see , was great - especially in the cafeteria scene , he had wonderful comic timing . Harry Gribbon was hilarious as the comedy director - there were so many hilarious scenes in this film and Marion was at the top of them all - I 'm giving this film 10 out of 10.Highly , Highly Recommended .",709,1,0.00019607843137256655,0.00019607843137256655,0.00019607843137256655,0.044947339652855224,0.05534207081691761,0.00019607843137256655,0.010005689874942558,0.00019607843137256655,0.00019607843137256655,0.00019607843137256655,0.00019607843137256655,0.06743126801443712,0.08102687939253934,0.00019607843137256655,0.00019607843137256655,0.00019607843137256655,0.00019607843137256655,0.00019607843137256655,0.00019607843137256655,0.00019607843137256655,0.42316579488754213,0.00019607843137256655,0.00019607843137256655,0.00019607843137256655,0.00019607843137256655,0.014943367347216683,0.00019607843137256655,0.00019607843137256655,0.00019607843137256655,0.00019607843137256655,0.00019607843137256655,0.00019607843137256655,0.00019607843137256655,0.00019607843137256655,0.00019607843137256655,0.00019607843137256655,0.012453266090595926,0.00019607843137256655,0.05951839095910058,0.00019607843137256655,0.00019607843137256655,0.00019607843137256655,0.00019607843137256655,0.1574997376080646,0.00019607843137256655,0.06601913653225805,0.00019607843137256655,0.00019607843137256655,0.00019607843137256655,0.00019607843137256655,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0
41041,0,"I had the pleasure of screening "" The Big Bad Swim "" at the 2006 New London Film Festival last week . The festival highlights some of the best independent and non - mainstream films from the past year . It was my assumption that "" The Big Bad Swim "" was chosen for screening at this festival for the simple reason that it was shot locally in and around Eastern Connecticut . However , as the credits began to roll I could only think about how well "" The Big Bad Swim "" compared to the others featured during the festival . By far it topped my list , followed by "" The Puffy Chair "" , "" Who Killed The Electric Car "" and "" Transamerica"" . The "" The Big Bad Swim "" is an engaging , truthful and often - humorous look at several adult education swim class pupils and their likable yet troubled instructor that has a depth that I 've not seen on screen in quite a while . The interweaving character development and plot lines derived from something as absurd as adult - swimming lessons works in subtle and endearing ways which I found refreshing . The plot does n't beat you over the head with a direction ; rather it builds and grows organically with a pace that was spot on . I was never bored . I never cringed . I never stepped out of the story on the screen . The humor of the film is something like "" Napoleon Dynamite "" meets "" Old School "" . The acting from a group of relatively unknown actors was credible and their dialog never seemed awkward or contrived . Obviously not being a multi - million production the camera shot were n't all awe - inspiring and clear , but adequate and well done for the budget . The lighting and filming technique for scenes filmed in the strip club setting were particularly eye catching because of a more realistic approach than a similar themed scene found in "" Closer "" . I also found shots filmed underwater of the class from the waist down seemed to be just as much a portrait of character as a shot from the shoulders up could be . I sure it 's said over and over from many in the independent film industry , but I have to say it : If "" The Big Bad Swim "" is n't picked up for some kind of distribution I would extremely disappointed . "" The Big Bad Swim "" needs to be seen . If you have the chance to see this film , SEE IT ! Disappointment is impossible !",456,1,0.00028571428571431853,0.00028571428571431853,0.00028571428571431853,0.016301383730802397,0.00028571428571431853,0.00028571428571431853,0.00028571428571431853,0.00028571428571431853,0.00028571428571431853,0.00028571428571431853,0.00028571428571431853,0.00028571428571431853,0.00028571428571431853,0.00028571428571431853,0.00028571428571431853,0.00028571428571431853,0.10494952413673586,0.00028571428571431853,0.00028571428571431853,0.014692781941796672,0.1775727109723171,0.00028571428571431853,0.00028571428571431853,0.00028571428571431853,0.00028571428571431853,0.00028571428571431853,0.00028571428571431853,0.00028571428571431853,0.00028571428571431853,0.1414025624107012,0.00028571428571431853,0.00028571428571431853,0.00028571428571431853,0.00028571428571431853,0.00028571428571431853,0.00028571428571431853,0.00028571428571431853,0.00028571428571431853,0.00028571428571431853,0.00028571428571431853,0.00028571428571431853,0.00028571428571431853,0.00028571428571431853,0.49668891690349004,0.03610640561844121,0.00028571428571431853,0.00028571428571431853,0.00028571428571431853,0.00028571428571431853,0.00028571428571431853,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0
41099,0,"Oh it 's so cool to watch a Silent Classic once in while ! Director Vidor is simply delightful and even makes a lengthy ( at least for 1928 ) cameo as himself .

41202,0,"1st watched 8/29/2009 - 7 out of 10 ( Dir - Sidney Franklin ) : Well told account of farmers in China and their rise to prominence and struggles with what Mother nature throws at them . This movie is based on an award winning novel and chronicles a family starting with the son 's arranged marriage to a slave girl . The movie does a good job of keeping your interest despite a somewhat hammy performance by the lead played by Paul Muni . It chronicles , Wong Long(the character played by Muni ) and how he works the land , buys more land , eventually becomes very rich but then returns to the land where he originally started . The relationship between him and his wife , played by Luise Rainer , is the main thread of the story(besides the land itself ) and despite the obvious non - Chinese actors it does a pretty good job of displaying the country and it 's people . It 's obvious that MGM used it 's money to create a really good epic with this one in an era where they could probably afford it . The scene with the locusts is done exceedingly well and the rest of th movie really looks good warranting the Best Cinematography award at the Oscars in that year . The definitive definition of an epic is what this story is and it 's pulled off pretty well .",245,1,0.00040000000000003824,0.00040000000000003824,0.00040000000000003824,0.00040000000000003824,0.00040000000000003824,0.00040000000000003824,0.00040000000000003824,0.00040000000000003824,0.00040000000000003824,0.00040000000000003824,0.00040000000000003824,0.00040000000000003824,0.00040000000000003824,0.00040000000000003824,0.00040000000000003824,0.00040000000000003824,0.10355332543390953,0.00040000000000003824,0.00040000000000003824,0.00040000000000003824,0.14686051014331206,0.35889924350706026,0.00040000000000003824,0.021947788347919075,0.05363798435192861,0.00040000000000003824,0.00040000000000003824,0.00040000000000003824,0.00040000000000003824,0.030679063054895633,0.00040000000000003824,0.00040000000000003824,0.00040000000000003824,0.00040000000000003824,0.00040000000000003824,0.00040000000000003824,0.029227855517184625,0.00040000000000003824,0.00040000000000003824,0.00040000000000003824,0.00040000000000003824,0.09423051360701647,0.02877291442117125,0.00040000000000003824,0.04921322947482427,0.0673775721407766,0.00040000000000003824,0.00040000000000003824,0.00040000000000003824,0.00040000000000003824,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0
41224,0,"Before she went into politics or public service , Glenda Jackson was one of Britain 's finest film actresses . This film displays her talent despite having a supporting role in a stellar cast that includes Julie Christie as Kitty , the wife of a British Royal Captain who has lost his memory of the last 20 years , and Jenny played by American Ann - Margret in an almost unrecognizable role as the doting sister . Alan Bates plays the captain who suffers from memory loss triggered by the shell shock during World War I. Sir Ian Holm has a smaller role as the doctor treating him . You see familiar faces like Sheila Keith , Patsy Byrne , and Frank Finlay . You ca n't help but watch Glenda play a dowdy housewife and the first true love of the Captain but they came from different classes . It 's not the greatest movie but it 's good to see Glenda 's amazing talent . She is still a fantastic actress , comedy or drama . She makes Margaret Grey into a likable character and you see why a regal captain fell in love with her .",199,1,0.0005555555555555992,0.0005555555555555992,0.0005555555555555992,0.0005555555555555992,0.0005555555555555992,0.036060227548944265,0.02833333341097213,0.0005555555555555992,0.09882985322923953,0.0005555555555555992,0.0005555555555555992,0.0005555555555555992,0.0005555555555555992,0.0005555555555555992,0.0005555555555555992,0.0005555555555555992,0.0005555555555555992,0.0005555555555555992,0.028333333333333727,0.0005555555555555992,0.43667788695783066,0.0005555555555555992,0.0005555555555555992,0.0005555555555555992,0.0005555555555555992,0.06062818309964529,0.0005555555555555992,0.0005555555555555992,0.0005555555555555992,0.0005555555555555992,0.0005555555555555992,0.08186392612993074,0.0005555555555555992,0.0005555555555555992,0.0005555555555555992,0.0005555555555555992,0.0005555555555555992,0.0005555555555555992,0.0005555555555555992,0.0005555555555555992,0.07710508607711125,0.0005555555555555992,0.0005555555555555992,0.12939039243521264,0.0005555555555555992,0.0005555555555555992,0.0005555555555555992,0.0005555555555555992,0.0005555555555555992,0.0005555555555555992,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
41456,0,"When I first saw this film on cable , it instantly became one of my favorite movies . I 'm a big fan of James Earl Jones and Robert Duvall . The movie paints an accurate picture of the South and the racist attitudes . Most of the attitudes came from Soll , an old plantation owner who uses convicts for labor . Soll is what makes the move , his funny ramblings give us insights in to the way The South was back then . I suppose that if Soll lived today he would be diagnosed with Alzheimer 's Disease . None the less his attitudes towards a little boy who comes to work for him and the convicts is complex . While he has racist views , he 's grown to trust some of the convicts who are all black . The two convicts he trusts most are Jackson(Mel Winkler ) and Ben(James Earl Jones ) . The conversations between Ben and Soll are the best in the movie , they have real chemistry . James Earl Jones and Mel Winkler both but in great performances as well as Hass . This movie should have gotten more notoriety . However it 's on DVD and worth the money .

41643,0,"( Sorry for my faulty language , i am no native speaker ... ) Yes , this is a movie that almost demands an overwhelming reaction . Personally i agree upon all those superlatives that are around . But i wo n't use this rather sematically void way myself to describe the movie here . Because those "" perfect ! the one - and - only ! best - ever!""-reviews make some people turn away ( including me).So if you are looking for another ' Hamlet ' that has the potential to rival with many theatrical and all cinematic ones - Then do n't miss this one , if you happen to find it anywhere . ( Unfortunately not too many people will have any chance to see it . It seems there is no DVD out there , and the German language version - which is quite well done - is not available in any format.)Just in case you decide to get a copy : Spare out that cut down two hours ( or so ) version of this movie . It is no use and no fun , and gives a wrong impression of a movie , that deals in an interesting way with flow and architecture . And its also crippled down to 4:3 aspect ratio .

41685,0,"Based on the idea from Gackt , Moon Child took place in a poverty - stricken country called Mallepa . In a futuristic timeline , the story followed the lives of the two main characters , Kei ( HYDE ) and Sho ( Gackt ) and their friends growing up together . Despite some actions might be overly done or perhaps humorous , I strongly believed that this is a movie about friendship . Even amongst all the hardships between each character , in the end , each of them wanted to have someone on their side , to have friends . Unlike most vampire characters , Kei portrayed a vampire that loathed the idea of having to kill in order to live . A vampire found friendship in the hand of a young boy , Sho who 's not afraid of Kei . Regardless of what some might 've thought , I see Kei as a fatherly figure to Sho . Kei was there throughout the earlier life of Sho , he took care of him , and taught him to live in a world where power between gangs controls their lives . On the other hand , Sho who perhaps can be seen as an innocent enthusiastic style young man , he grew up to be a man who realised that life is n't all about fun and games , that death exists and able to take away his loved ones . I love the part where Lee Hom , the actor who played Son , first appeared on the screen . The way they met up was quite cool indeed . Son also has a big part within this movie , the fact that he 's from a different race , a Taiwanese , made quite an impact to the friendship theme within the movie . The way how friendships were developed despite background differences was portrayed excellently in this movie . I believed that each actor did a great job considering that this was their first time to appear in such big screen movie . Both HYDE and Gackt managed to act quite well and created quite believable characters . Unlike movies that had musician turned actors and filled the movie with songs , they 've done great acting jobs ! Moon Child really made an impact for me , it has given friendships a new meaning and consideration , that we have to appreciate every friendship in our lifetimes . The movie shows a lot of hope , despite all the bad things that happen in their lives , that there 's always hope . Life can be cruel , that it seems hope does n't exist anymore . It also shows a very strong sense of friendships between each other , even when Son became the enemy , Sho did have some sort of "" fun "" at their last battle . Every single one of them desired peace in the end , no matter how far apart they 've become . The ending scene showed it to us .",516,1,0.00017543859649124383,0.05592870583357589,0.00017543859649124383,0.00017543859649124383,0.00017543859649124383,0.031883791416420254,0.009026582146793449,0.19702411272889742,0.020406113673063383,0.00017543859649124383,0.00017543859649124383,0.00017543859649124383,0.06940977471833923,0.00017543859649124383,0.00017543859649124383,0.00017543859649124383,0.016162823820165918,0.00017543859649124383,0.00017543859649124383,0.00017543859649124383,0.40584671921971655,0.00017543859649124383,0.00017543859649124383,0.00017543859649124383,0.03778577445096784,0.00017543859649124383,0.00017543859649124383,0.00017543859649124383,0.00017543859649124383,0.00017543859649124383,0.00017543859649124383,0.00017543859649124383,0.011939646362809716,0.00017543859649124383,0.07427353916613212,0.00017543859649124383,0.00017543859649124383,0.00017543859649124383,0.00017543859649124383,0.00017543859649124383,0.00017543859649124383,0.0636457497964509,0.00017543859649124383,0.00017543859649124383,0.00017543859649124383,0.00017543859649124383,0.00017543859649124383,0.00017543859649124383,0.00017543859649124383,0.00017543859649124383,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
41703,0,"The third collaboration for Karloff and Lugosi sees a move away from Poe and into the realm of the science fiction serial . Karloff plays Dr. Janos Rukh , creator of a device that can capture light rays through his telescope in the Carpathian Mountains and translate them into pictures that form a visual history of the universe . Before several guests , including Lugosi as Dr. Benet , an astro - chemist who had previously scoffed at Rukh 's theories , he demonstrates the existence of an unknown radioactive element , here termed "" Radium X "" , contained in a meteor that fell to Earth in darkest Africa several thousand years ago . Karloff joins the expedition to prove his theories , but Radium X is a tricky compound - it levels mountains at long range , and cures blindness at short range . Rukh is careless , however , and poisons himself , glowing in the dark rather like those old Ready Breck commercials ! Dr. Benet is on hand to devise a counter - active for the radiation , but combination of poison and cure drives Rukh insanely paranoid . Convinced he has been cheated , he seeks out the members of the expedition in Paris , including his estranged wife , and his very touch while in his radioactive state means death ... Along the way we get the old pseudo - scientific idea that a dead person 's eyes record the image of their killer ( a remarkably distinct Karloff ! ) and the Radium X device used to symbolically melt statues that represent the expedition members . And even a touch of James Whale in a cockney landlady in Paris!The Invisible Ray is great fun , aside from the Gothic opening it 's interesting to see Universal move the action around to Africa and Paris . The film lacks pace , but is always absorbing . Karloff slightly overdoes his performance but Lugosi is terrific . Universal used the basic story outline again in Man Made Monster , this time with Lon Chaney Jr. as the glowing menace ( this time caused by electricity ) and Lionel Atwill as a much madder doctor than Lugosi is here . The Invisible Ray is a sombre and clever little film with much to admire . Not as famous as other Universal Horrors , perhaps , but it works and is highly entertaining .",408,1,0.0004761904761905254,0.0004761904761905254,0.0004761904761905254,0.0004761904761905254,0.0004761904761905254,0.0004761904761905254,0.0004761904761905254,0.16588729836879096,0.07786546048062913,0.0004761904761905254,0.0004761904761905254,0.02430952460183188,0.0004761904761905254,0.0004761904761905254,0.0004761904761905254,0.0004761904761905254,0.060543782340866735,0.0004761904761905254,0.0004761904761905254,0.0004761904761905254,0.0004761904761905254,0.0004761904761905254,0.0004761904761905254,0.04183716132513257,0.0004761904761905254,0.0004761904761905254,0.0004761904761905254,0.0004761904761905254,0.0004761904761905254,0.03298195443521777,0.0004761904761905254,0.020544704512141604,0.0004761904761905254,0.0004761904761905254,0.0918339264992289,0.0004761904761905254,0.0004761904761905254,0.0004761904761905254,0.05875794631778506,0.0004761904761905254,0.15781298107201383,0.0004761904761905254,0.0004761904761905254,0.2490538314749309,0.0004761904761905254,0.0004761904761905254,0.0004761904761905254,0.0004761904761905254,0.0004761904761905254,0.0004761904761905254,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
41858,0,""" Journey of Hope "" tells of a poor Turkish family and their odyssey of hope which spirals downward into despair as they travel to Switzerland in search of prosperity . Although this Oscar winning film is fairly well crafted , it is lacking in substance and has many implausibilities . Much of the film 's 1.7 hour run time is get on the bus , get off the bus , get on the boat , get off the boat , get in the van , get out of the van , etc . ; time which could have been better spent or left out completely . The story has a predictable conclusion , especially for those who have an awareness of the common crime of trafficking in illegal immigrants .

42508,0,"I 've just seen this movie for the second time on television . It 's lovely , warm , sentimental , very very romantic . I 've rarely seen actors better able to reveal by their movements and gestures love for another -Cybill Shepherd , Ryan O'Neal , Robert Downey , Jr . and especially Mary Stuart Masterson simply outdo themselves . Masterson probably has the hardest role and is just adorable . The movie is in the vein of both romantic movies such as While You Were Sleeping , When Harry Met Sally , Sleepless in Seattle and the "" high gimmick "" sorts of movies like Big , Back to the Future , Peggy Sue Got Married . I hate to say this , because this cast was superb and I 'd never change any of them- but I think it did n't succeed as well as the movies mentioned above because the box office appeal of the cast was just not as great as Meg Ryan , Tom Hanks , Michael J. Fox , and Kathleen Turner at the time the movie was made . It 's not superbly written - e.g. , the characters ' lines are not particularly memorable . Yet it 's executed to perfection . The romantic yearnings are truly palpable , the "" feeling "" of people falling in love is exquisitely communicated , love 's timelessness and all - encompassing sweep , the feeling of loss and desire to recapture that connection , are so touchingly delivered . Again and again , you will find yourself moved . Actually , a comparable movie is Made in Heaven -the same romantic yearning .

42543,0,"I do miss the company Vestron , they sure had their finger on the pulse of unique and unusual cinema back in the 1980s .

Charlotte Burke at first seems quite precocious and yet you warm up to her because by being a bit of a mischievous child , it makes it hard for the adults to believe what she is experiencing . She becomes very self aware and strong towards the end , even finding she does n't "" hate boys "" as she so defiantly claimed at first . Through this we are treated to many touching moments and some immensely scary ones , all visually stunning with a grand score from Hans Zimmer . I 'm quite proud to be an owner of the soundtrack on CD when it was released in the United States on RCA Victor . At the time of this writing there is no DVD of Paperhouse yet available in the U.S. ( only in Europe ) , here 's hoping one of my wishes will come true as I truly cherish this beautiful film and a DVD of it would be very welcome!It 's satisfying watching the girl work out her thoughts like a puzzle game trying to make the dream world work for her and her newfound friend Marc ( Elliot Spiers ) . Both Charlotte Burke and Elliot Spiers do a magnificent job throughout , I find the editorial comment on Amazon.com about it being "" hammy acting "" quite perplexing -- I found every aspect of Paperhouse to be exhilarating . Even in minor scenes of brilliance like when Charlotte and the girl in the classroom are staring at each other through the glass on a door , it 's quite powerful . You do n't have to be an arthouse type to enjoy Paperhouse , just be a person that enjoys a film that stimulates and has you wanting more . There is enough in this film to invite repeated viewings and I 'm still in awe of the cinematography and sets . For me , it 's never like watching the same film twice , as there are so many details to absorb and savor . A very emotional experience indeed . While there are many films I adore , there are only a few specific ones that strike a great emotional chord in me : films like Paperhouse , Static , Resurrection , and Donnie Darko . When I see so much drek out there passing as films that will easily be forgotten and in bargain bins , all I have to do is watch Paperhouse and my faith in wondrous storytelling is renewed .",516,1,0.13878633606755536,0.048566972322613575,0.000277777777777802,0.000277777777777802,0.000277777777777802,0.000277777777777802,0.000277777777777802,0.1254532691655116,0.000277777777777802,0.000277777777777802,0.000277777777777802,0.000277777777777802,0.000277777777777802,0.000277777777777802,0.000277777777777802,0.000277777777777802,0.000277777777777802,0.07756597654977285,0.000277777777777802,0.000277777777777802,0.000277777777777802,0.000277777777777802,0.000277777777777802,0.000277777777777802,0.07795329511379631,0.000277777777777802,0.000277777777777802,0.000277777777777802,0.000277777777777802,0.000277777777777802,0.000277777777777802,0.000277777777777802,0.000277777777777802,0.000277777777777802,0.000277777777777802,0.000277777777777802,0.000277777777777802,0.000277777777777802,0.000277777777777802,0.000277777777777802,0.000277777777777802,0.017174652042582575,0.000277777777777802,0.46321405431830714,0.000277777777777802,0.019212599603952513,0.020683955927018282,0.000277777777777802,0.000277777777777802,0.000277777777777802,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0

42656,0,"The time is the future and for many not aware of it , that day is now . In this final movie for legendary actor , Edward G. Robinson , "" Solent Green "" becomes a landmark classic . Many a film buff and environmentalist believe this is our eventual history . The movie is taken from the novel entitled , ' Make room , make room ' but who 's working title was changed to "" Solent Green . "" The story concerns the Earth as it evolves into the future with the world 's environmental problems becoming nothing short of Catastrophic . The planet 's natural resources have been exhausted and basic food has been reduced to simple staples . They come in a variety of colors , such as Solent Yellow , Solent Red , and now ' Solent Green . ' However there are those who know the ' real ' ingredient in Solent Green and cringe at their own culpability and fear divine retribution . The first is a food executive named William R.

Although corruption goes all the way to the top , it begins with Simonsons ' Bodyguard , Tad Fielding ( Chuck Connors ) and Security chief Donnovan ( Roy Jenson ) who target Thorn for a Waste Desposal Factory . Thorn 's boss , Lt . Hatcher ( Brock Peters ) believes his suspicions but warns him of those ' Higher and Hot ' who want the case closed , but Thorn will not risk his "" Job "" for an easy way out .

42960,0,"Picture the scene : a mountainous alien landscape . Twin moons illuminate the blood red sky . The Tardis lands , and out steps the Doctor , a middle - aged man in a Victorian frock coat , and Rose , his companion from Earth . A flicker of recognition crosses his face . "" Well , I never ! Its the planet Saurious-7 . Where I fought the warlike Kraggartians . They tried to use giant Skinkons to take over the planet . "" . The girl sniffs the air . "" Ca n't we go , Doctor . I do n't like the look of this place . I keep thinking we 're being watched . "" . The Doctor wags a disapproving finger . "" Do n't be silly , girl . I wonder if the King and Queen of Cordaraby City remember me from my last visit . Come along , Rose , come along ! "" . He strides off , the girl struggles to keep up . High on a hill , sinister red eyes regard them with hatred ... That was not how ' Rose ' began back in 2005 , and thank heavens for that say I. Unfairly derided at the time of its original U.K. broadcast , ' Rose ' can now safely be regarded as a landmark episode , putting ' Dr . Who ' back where it belonged , as one of the B.B.C. 's flagship programmes . The mistakes made by the McGann T.V. movie were well learnt . Instead of trying to shoehorn the new ' Who ' into existing chronology , it represented a fresh start for the series , beginning with shop girl Rose Tyler ( Billie Piper ) going about her daily routine . One day she goes to the basement to find a man named Wilson , and then the trouble begins . Mannequins come to life and attack her . It is only through the intervention of a mysterious stranger ( Christopher Eccleston ) that she is saved . The story , slight though it may be , is more than adequate as a starting - point for the series . The Autons are , of course , an old villain ( this was their first appearance since 1971 ) , but no references are made to their past appearances - another wise move . The finale effectively recreated the famous scene in ' Spearhead From Space ' when shop window dummies sprang to life . As the Doctor , Christopher Eccleston lacked the eccentricity of his predecessors , preferring a modern leather jacket to the Doctor 's traditional period clothes , but this made him more accessible to the show 's hoped - for new audience . Billie Piper confounded her critics by making a big impression as ' Rose ' . Also good was Noel Clarke as her boyfriend ' Mickey' . Yes , there was an added emphasis on special effects , but then there needed to be - the wobbly sets and unconvincing monsters of the past have no place on 21st century television . What is more important is how good a script this is . Ten million people tuned in to see the new Doctor . 'Dr . Who ' was back - and back with a bang !",563,1,0.1599392168766102,0.1150050299107516,0.000307692307692344,0.000307692307692344,0.03181567761383529,0.000307692307692344,0.03274419614165483,0.18534495924954722,0.000307692307692344,0.000307692307692344,0.000307692307692344,0.000307692307692344,0.025062091907035785,0.000307692307692344,0.000307692307692344,0.000307692307692344,0.000307692307692344,0.000307692307692344,0.000307692307692344,0.000307692307692344,0.28670301131181264,0.000307692307692344,0.000307692307692344,0.05231291002935852,0.04138257999887166,0.014569087946314228,0.000307692307692344,0.000307692307692344,0.000307692307692344,0.027893555734710595,0.000307692307692344,0.000307692307692344,0.000307692307692344,0.000307692307692344,0.000307692307692344,0.015535375587188633,0.000307692307692344,0.000307692307692344,0.000307692307692344,0.000307692307692344,0.000307692307692344,0.000307692307692344,0.000307692307692344,0.000307692307692344,0.000307692307692344,0.000307692307692344,0.000307692307692344,0.000307692307692344,0.000307692307692344,0.000307692307692344,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Excellent , dark , and spooky TV horror movie in the same class as "" Crowhaven Farm "" ; "" Do n't Be Afraid Of The Dark "" ; and "" Satan 's School for Girls "" , all lost Satanic classics . I also think it has many parallels to Clint Eastwood 's classic , "" High Plains Drifter "" . Why do n't they release these great little movies , especially when you consider all of the more recent garbage that fills the discount DVD racks at Wal - Mart ? Most of these flicks have a cult - following , so sales should n't be a problem .",153,1,0.0006896551724138435,0.0006896551724138435,0.0006896551724138435,0.0006896551724138435,0.03242966096249756,0.0006896551724138435,0.0006896551724138435,0.0006896551724138435,0.12205685873942394,0.0006896551724138435,0.0006896551724138435,0.0006896551724138435,0.0006896551724138435,0.0006896551724138435,0.0006896551724138435,0.0006896551724138435,0.0006896551724138435,0.07339371878434667,0.0006896551724138435,0.0006896551724138435,0.49844829870323404,0.0006896551724138435,0.027758134858533703,0.0006896551724138435,0.0006896551724138435,0.09840041385451884,0.0006896551724138435,0.0006896551724138435,0.0006896551724138435,0.03508731314193308,0.0006896551724138435,0.0006896551724138435,0.0006896551724138435,0.0006896551724138435,0.0006896551724138435,0.0006896551724138435,0.0006896551724138435,0.0006896551724138435,0.0006896551724138435,0.0006896551724138435,0.08346008371413105,0.0006896551724138435,0.0006896551724138435,0.0006896551724138435,0.0006896551724138435,0.0006896551724138435,0.0006896551724138435,0.0006896551724138435,0.0006896551724138435,0.0006896551724138435,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
43548,0,"Director Sam Fuller has something of a cult following , particularly in Europe . Yet the bulk of his films are more than forgettable . He did however direct one really terrific movie in "" Pickup on South Street "" . Made pretty early on in his career , the movies that followed were vastly inferior . From the first to the last frame , "" Pickup "" works on all levels . It 's filmed with flawless fluidity , boasting fine performances all round . Richard Widmark and Thelma Ritter both players with a fine record of top notch performances , are at their peak . Widmark , who was no stranger at playing villains , while truly mean to the core , still manages to reveal just the slightest humanity which makes his character fascinating as well as making Jean Peters character 's falling for him all the more credible . Fuller holds no punches in this genuinely tough movie . There is a scene in which Jean Peters get roughed up by Widmark . It 's truly shocking in its reality . This is not a case of carefully choreographed photography . Less self conscious than many film noir 's of the period this remains a great example of the genre .",215,1,0.0006451612903226191,0.0006451612903226191,0.0006451612903226191,0.0006451612903226191,0.07106754796681031,0.0006451612903226191,0.0006451612903226191,0.0006451612903226191,0.0006451612903226191,0.0006451612903226191,0.0006451612903226191,0.0006451612903226191,0.0006451612903226191,0.0006451612903226191,0.0006451612903226191,0.0006451612903226191,0.0006451612903226191,0.0006451612903226191,0.0006451612903226191,0.0006451612903226191,0.1627042928928092,0.06637802194743792,0.0006451612903226191,0.0006451612903226191,0.0006451612903226191,0.0006451612903226191,0.0006451612903226191,0.0006451612903226191,0.0006451612903226191,0.0006451612903226191,0.0006451612903226191,0.0006451612903226191,0.0006451612903226191,0.0006451612903226191,0.0006451612903226191,0.0006451612903226191,0.0006451612903226191,0.0006451612903226191,0.12783765353969775,0.0006451612903226191,0.0006451612903226191,0.0006451612903226191,0.0006451612903226191,0.542980225588727,0.0006451612903226191,0.0006451612903226191,0.0006451612903226191,0.0006451612903226191,0.0006451612903226191,0.0006451612903226191,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

44010,0,"Probably Jackie Chan 's best film in the 1980s , and the one that put him on the map . The scale of this self - directed police drama is evident from the opening and closing scenes , during which a squatters ' village and shopping mall are demolished . There are , clearly , differences between the original Chinese and dubbed English versions , with many of the jokes failing to make their way into the latter . The latter is also hampered by stars who sound nothing like their Chinese originals . In fact , the only thing the dubbing has corrected is the court trialat the time , trials in colonial Hong Kong were conducted in English , while the original has this scene in Cantonese!Nonetheless , Chan 's fighting style and the martial arts choreography inject humour where possible , so non - Cantonese audiences do n't miss much . It 's not , after all , the dialogue that makes a Chan flick , but the action and the painful out - takes . The story is easy to follow : Chan plays an incorruptible Hong Kong detective pursuing a gangland godfather ( Cho Yeun ) , and assigned to protect a star witness ( Brigitte Lin ) . The action is superb from beginning to end , and there 's not much time to breathe in between . It 'll never get you thinking , but what an entertaining , and well strung - together , film . Arguably , this is one of the best martial arts films out there .",268,1,0.0005000000000000423,0.0005000000000000423,0.0005000000000000423,0.0005000000000000423,0.0005000000000000423,0.0005000000000000423,0.0005000000000000423,0.0005000000000000423,0.0005000000000000423,0.0005000000000000423,0.0005000000000000423,0.0005000000000000423,0.0005000000000000423,0.0005000000000000423,0.0005000000000000423,0.0005000000000000423,0.0005000000000000423,0.0005000000000000423,0.0005000000000000423,0.0005000000000000423,0.0005000000000000423,0.15540576363678466,0.0005000000000000423,0.0005000000000000423,0.0005000000000000423,0.0005000000000000423,0.0005000000000000423,0.0005000000000000423,0.026210351517224784,0.0005000000000000423,0.0005000000000000423,0.0005000000000000423,0.0005000000000000423,0.0005000000000000423,0.0005000000000000423,0.0005000000000000423,0.0005000000000000423,0.050966901574332917,0.07333579971963106,0.0005000000000000423,0.0005000000000000423,0.0005000000000000423,0.0005000000000000423,0.5808243625651628,0.07151909612233466,0.0005000000000000423,0.020237724864527254,0.0005000000000000423,0.0005000000000000423,0.0005000000000000423,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0
44053,0,"Hilarious , evocative , confusing , brilliant film . Reminds me of Bunuel 's L'Age D'Or or Jodorowsky 's Holy Mountain-- lots of strange characters mucking about and looking for ..... what is it ? I laughed almost the whole way through , all the while keeping a peripheral eye on the bewildered and occasionally horrified reactions of the audience that surrounded me in the theatre . Entertaining through and through , from the beginning to the guts and poisoned entrails all the way to the end , if it was an end . I only wish i could remember every detail . It haunts me sometimes . Honestly , though , i have only the most positive recollections of this film . As it does n't seem to be available to take home and watch , i suppose i 'll have to wait a few more years until Crispin Glover comes my way again with his Big Slide Show ( and subsequent "" What is it ? "" screening ) ... I saw this film in Atlanta almost directly after being involved in a rather devastating car crash , so i was slightly dazed at the time , which was perhaps a very good state of mind to watch the prophetic talking arthropods and the retards in the superhero costumes and godlike Glover in his appropriate burly - Q setting , scantily clad girlies rising out of the floor like a magnificent DADAist wet dream . Is it a statement on Life As We Know It ? Of course everyone EXPECTS art to be just that . I rather think that the truth is more evident in the absences and in the negative space .

44103,0,"Johnny Dangerously falls completely in the hit or miss category with it 's overblown gags and complete lack of a comprehensive script or story that makes ANY sense . But that 's the point , right?The cast is likable ; Michael Keaton an excellent comic performer before he took himself too seriously as the years passed . Griffin Dunne , Peter Boyle , Joe Piscopo , Marilu Henner and Danny DeVito all perform with enthusiasm and at least get a lot of laughs from me . But the complete scene stealer here is Richard Dimitri ( sneaking the word "" Iceholes "" into movie history ) as a mobster who fares best at murdering the English language . I associate many childhood memories with this film , as I watched it quite often so maybe I 'm prone to enjoy it more than many others . Johnny Dangerously is at least a completely innocent gangster film spoof that even relays some well meaning messages about the dangers of smoking ( and sex).I like it but it 's hard to recommend.7 out of 10 .",184,1,0.0005714285714286228,0.0005714285714286228,0.0005714285714286228,0.04843933316535674,0.0005714285714286228,0.0005714285714286228,0.0005714285714286228,0.0005714285714286228,0.0005714285714286228,0.0005714285714286228,0.0005714285714286228,0.028556273802340756,0.0005714285714286228,0.0005714285714286228,0.0005714285714286228,0.0005714285714286228,0.0005714285714286228,0.0005714285714286228,0.0005714285714286228,0.0005714285714286228,0.29554512941355426,0.0005714285714286228,0.0005714285714286228,0.0005714285714286228,0.0005714285714286228,0.0005714285714286228,0.0005714285714286228,0.0005714285714286228,0.0005714285714286228,0.0005714285714286228,0.0005714285714286228,0.0005714285714286228,0.0005714285714286228,0.0005714285714286228,0.0005714285714286228,0.07320675725109212,0.0005714285714286228,0.08681137672032717,0.031834715588411305,0.0005714285714286228,0.04252446690187815,0.0005714285714286228,0.0005714285714286228,0.36908194715703735,0.0005714285714286228,0.0005714285714286228,0.0005714285714286228,0.0005714285714286228,0.0005714285714286228,0.0005714285714286228,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

44565,0,"This is my FAVORITE ALL time movie . It used to be my Friday night movie with a pizza and bottle of wine when I was single . I first saw this movie with my aunt Brend and sister Chasity . I was in the 2nd grade . I fell in LOVE with Travolta and Sissy was my new best friend . I 've read a lot of comments about why Bud left Sissy & how Sissy has to "" learn to act "" married . But let 's go back and look at this for a second : SPOILER - My interpretation of the movie now , not when I was eight is this about Bud & Sissy 's relationship takes a turn for the worst because she makes a fool of him at Gilley 's riding the bull . They get in a huge fight . Bud tries to make Sissy jealous by asking Pam to dance . Sissy then thinks two wrongs will make a right and Wes asks her if "" she needs any help "" . They 're all on the dance floor acting like fools when Bud asks Pam , "" when are you going to take me home and rape me ? "" Pam answers : "" When ever you 're ready Cowboy "" . Bud then goes home with Pam to her condo in downtown Houston . Which Daddy has bought for her with his oil money and "" all that that implies "" . Bud is the one who cheats on Sissy . Sissy is waiting for Bud when he returns home the next day . Sissy is the ONE who leaves Bud . Then , it 's up to Bud to prove to Sissy that he is a real "" cowboy "" and win her back . Anyways , that 's my interpretation . Everyone has their I 'm sure ! I love this movie . And believe it or not , I got myself a REAL cowboy !

44941,0,"Personal taste rules when it comes to talking about movies such as this treasured little gem . Way back in the eighties , the early eighties , i discovered this movie , like so many released at the time , "" Night Patrol "" "" Bad Manners "" or even "" King Frat "" the artwork and blurbs on the back of the covers tempted and teased you . Of course being of an age , movies like that i have already mentioned as well as stuff like "" Screwballs "" and the many others , captured the imagination , and thankfully many years later i still remember some with fondness and some with disdain the many movies that help maintain my love of such genre as parodies or pastiches . Made many years after the huge success of "" Animal House "" and having seen how it had fared down through the years , I now know that there would be no way this movie would ever eclipse the box office bucks obtain aforementioned nor would it linger in the memory , much like that of National Lampoon 's Vacation . To be honest , not everything that has carried the National Lampoon Logo has been a wild success , however to me Class Reunion remains one of my all time favourite movies , with instantly recognisable characters , such as the aloof Bob Spinnaker played to perfection by Gerrit Graham , so good in Charles Band 's "" Terrorvision "" still lingering in the past glories of his youth . Or how about Stephen Furst 's brash and ballsy turn as the high school lazy drunken sex crazed bum Hubert Downs . Sweet as . Which makes me ponder . As i already said , personal taste not withstanding . People can be so cruel , so it will never win any awards or be compared to the like of its 's peers within the comedy world . It does have some merit . Being one of the earlier scripts penned by John Hughes , who would later go on to do one of my own favourites of his work "" Weird Science "" as well as having a wonderful theme title sung by the great Gary U.S Bonds .

45033,0,"Now , admittedly , I 'm no ardent student of the genre . As a matter of fact , I 've tended always to shy away from Westerns because , in spite of all their critical cachet as America 's primal stories ( or whatever ) , they seem to me to forever devolve into tiresome retreads of either "" shoot up the Injuns , "" "" the big gunfight , "" or "" Hey , let 's form a posse ! "" In other words , it always seemed to me a genre so rooted in and tied to convention , that it left precious little room for surprise or originality . ( And yes , I HAVE seen at least some of the so - called "" greats "" , and unapologetically lump them into this negative assessment - including Stagecoach , Rio Bravo , My Darling Clementine , and of course the infamous [ but profoundly dull ] Clint Eastwood - Sergio Leone teamups in the ' 60s.)But when I saw this movie on TV - as part of a commemorative Jimmy Stewart weekend upon his death - I finally GOT IT : I understood , at least in theory , what the Western mythos has to offer as a serious thematic preoccupation ( aside from just action and thrills ) . It is the push - pull between lawlessness and order ; the American West represented freedom , but also the prospect of the wild , the untamed . Respectable folk could get hurt out there . Which , of course , meant that perhaps - just perhaps - it was n't meant for respectable folk , and that the only residents should be the amoral and the shifty , those who dispensed justice strictly from the barrel of their revolvers , and where kill or be killed would ever be the law of the land . In such an environment , of course , the true heroes are the ones who are ornery and free - spirited enough to be out there in the first place ( and so reject "" society , "" at least as it manifested itself on the Eastern seaboard ) , and yet have enough sense of justice to believe that a society based on chaos and fear just IS NOT RIGHT . Catching and examining that disparity between law and disorder IN THE MAIN CHARACTER HIMSELF is , I believe ( after seeing this movie ) , the highest and truest goal of any Western . Sadly , it is so often not the case , as the white hats are completely white , the black ones completely black ( and let 's not even get started talking about the Indians , ok ) and there is precious little shades of gray in between . Not in this one . Jimmy Stewart plays a blatant fortune hunter who follows the trail of miners before him into the Alaskan wilderness to prospect for gold . He is joined in this by his lifelong buddy , played by Walter Brennan ( perhaps the Western cliché character to end them all - but nevertheless enjoyable here , as always ) - and no one else . Pointedly , they are out for themselves , and while Stewart displays his patented charm ( come on , we could never really dislike the guy , now could we ? ) , we are left with little doubt that his is basically a self - centered , self - interested character : none of his "" Gosh "" or "" Oh golly gee "" humanism is allowed to come through . Or , rather , it has to be EARNED , by the end of the picture , in the way I described above . He must confront the lawlessness in himself , and weigh it against the need for order and justice which are so blatantly lacking in the border town which serves as the miners ' starting point on their gold dust trail . This town is ruled tightly by its wicked sheriff , Mr. Gannon , played by John McIntire in one of the best "" bad guy "" performances I 've ever seen . He comes on with so much charm and humor , and has such a relaxed and interesting rapport with Stewart , that it actually takes awhile to recognize that he * is * the bad guy - so that when it finally sinks in , it does so with double force . Further , by establishing a type of breezy ( if necessarily guarded ) camaraderie between McIntire and Stewart , the film plays up the notion of how close in temperament they really are - and so how far a moral distance Stewart must walk by the end of the film . I wo n't go through all the twists and turns the plot takes - see those for yourself ( as well as the rugged and gorgeous Alaskan scenery - filmed on location , mind you , not cheap painted stills that the studio made up ) . What 's key here is how much this story focuses upon character , with great dialogue and character interaction substituting for gunplay much of the time - although the film has just enough action and adventure to prevent it from ever being static ( read : "" talky "" ) . Definitely one of the greatest performances I 've seen from Stewart , showing he could play the renegade , the "" man 's man "" just as convincingly as the decent and upright guy next door . If anything , in fact , his "" everyman "" qualities lend greater strength to his characterization , making him seem less mythic or overblown - -like , say , Eastwood or John Wayne - and more a three - dimensional personage . His relationship with Brennan is well - played : understated , but nevertheless touching ( with a faint suggestion of George and Lenny from "" Of Mice and Men "" - an altogether different type of "" western"").I certainly have more Westerns to see , but this is for now my favorite , and the yardstick by which I will necessarily judge all the others . It deserves to be much better known and appreciated than it is .",1073,1,0.0001418439716312218,0.0001418439716312218,0.0001418439716312218,0.0001418439716312218,0.0001418439716312218,0.0001418439716312218,0.0001418439716312218,0.1234783174557904,0.0001418439716312218,0.0001418439716312218,0.0001418439716312218,0.0001418439716312218,0.13195293415538414,0.0001418439716312218,0.0001418439716312218,0.0001418439716312218,0.0001418439716312218,0.0001418439716312218,0.0001418439716312218,0.0001418439716312218,0.37709083392110926,0.045422944527106955,0.0001418439716312218,0.0001418439716312218,0.0001418439716312218,0.0001418439716312218,0.0001418439716312218,0.0001418439716312218,0.0001418439716312218,0.0001418439716312218,0.0001418439716312218,0.01878086799389669,0.03598367516417871,0.0001418439716312218,0.04226741172136325,0.035317404455109114,0.0001418439716312218,0.0001418439716312218,0.0001418439716312218,0.0001418439716312218,0.0001418439716312218,0.0001418439716312218,0.0001418439716312218,0.15756084982606566,0.0001418439716312218,0.02647100191474701,0.0001418439716312218,0.0001418439716312218,0.0001418439716312218,0.0001418439716312218,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0
45224,0,"John Holmes is so famous , he 's infamous ( as the Three Amigos would say ) . This is a Rashomon - like story about the events surrounding the Wonderland Murders of the early 1980 's , in Los Angeles . The story is pieced together from the retelling of a few of the participants . There is story from the friend 's perspective , namely David Lind ( played by Dylan McDermott ) . He is a participant in the robbery assault at Eddie Nash 's place ( Eddie Nash is a infamous drug dealer - and is the suppose to be the same character Alfred Molina played in Boogie Nights ) and is heavily into the drug scene . There is John Holmes ' perspective ( played by Val Kilmer ) , which makes him out to be a pawn stuck between two kings ( with a severe case of cocaine cravings ) . There is also the patchwork recollections of John 's wife ( Sharon - played by Lisa Kudrow ) and his girlfriend ( Dawn - played by Kate Bosworth ) that fill in the spaces between the two stories . It is basically the same time frame that we are looking at , just each character 's version . The only thing that is missing is the perspective from the dead people . Paul Thomas Anderson 's Boogie Nights portrays John Holmes as a slightly heroic character , with a tragic yet comedic karma . He is a caricature of a real person . He was more of less , a mixed up kid that got what he got through his "" large "" endowment . Director James Cox turns the comedy off and makes this episode in John 's life into a nightmare for all of us watching . The details of the real life murders make this movie even more eerie . Val Kilmer took what he learned of Jim Morrison , from the Doors , enhanced the performance for the Salton Sea , and then further enhanced that to bring us the deterioration of John Holmes through cocaine . All of the actors pull off very realistic looking portrayal 's of cocaine junkies . Josh Lucas ' performance stands out as one of the best in the movie . He plays Ron Launius ( I think this character is suppose to be the same as the Thomas Jane character from Boogie Nights ) . Ron was the leader of the gang , loved having John Holmes around as a novelty and had a cocaine craving like sharks enjoy blood . The cocaine use seems so realistic as to make one think . Did they really use Splenda ? ? Where Boogie Nights has a bubblegum pop feel to it ( lots of color and 70 's nostalgia ) , Wonderland is dark . The action is fast and furious , with a lot of jumps . It is twitchy and grainy . There is no comedy , just a never ending pace , as if the director is trying to put us into the nervous , fast paced , edgy cocaine high to make us feel what the characters are feeling . This is a graphic movie . It has one of the most intensely violent scenes I have ever seen in a movie . It actually shows the murders themselves ( through the eyes of John Holmes at first and then from a third person perspective ) . It is so graphic , it looks like police evidence of a crime . I had to pause after this scene and remind myself this was just a movie . This movie is definitely not recommended for everyone . I recommend it as a good alternative to Boogie Nights , for those interested in the other sides of John Holmes.-Celluloid Rehab",649,1,0.0001834862385321268,0.0001834862385321268,0.0001834862385321268,0.0001834862385321268,0.0001834862385321268,0.01787634845206329,0.0001834862385321268,0.17148724550652059,0.0657311458273803,0.0001834862385321268,0.0001834862385321268,0.018170090796930414,0.0001834862385321268,0.0001834862385321268,0.0001834862385321268,0.0001834862385321268,0.0001834862385321268,0.0001834862385321268,0.0001834862385321268,0.0001834862385321268,0.6559864185677803,0.0001834862385321268,0.0001834862385321268,0.0001834862385321268,0.0001834862385321268,0.0001834862385321268,0.0001834862385321268,0.0001834862385321268,0.0001834862385321268,0.0001834862385321268,0.0001834862385321268,0.0001834862385321268,0.0001834862385321268,0.0001834862385321268,0.0001834862385321268,0.017135197111216523,0.0001834862385321268,0.0001834862385321268,0.0001834862385321268,0.0001834862385321268,0.0001834862385321268,0.0001834862385321268,0.02353410748677797,0.0001834862385321268,0.0001834862385321268,0.0001834862385321268,0.022373024232981525,0.0001834862385321268,0.0001834862385321268,0.0001834862385321268,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
45227,0,"To be fair , I expected car chases in this film . There was only really one , but apart from that , ' Freeway ' was a great movie which I am glad to own on DVD . The only really big names in the cast are HOMICIDE 's Richard Belzer as the radio psychiatrist and B - Movie villain par - excellance Billy Drago as the Revelation - quoting Freeway Killer . But the rest of the cast generally give good performances . I especially liked how Darlanne Fluegel gave her character , Sunny , a bit of guts . She could have been a helpless victim character but she is fully rounded as she seeks out Drago with the help of bounty hunter James Russo . Russo , I 'm afraid , comes across as rather wooden , but then again , the character he plays , Frank , is n't very well fleshed out save for a back story Sunny is given by his former commanding officer . The tone of menace is kept up superbly throughout the film and the atmosphere of the lonely LA freeway at night with the killer prowling its ' length in his sinister grey sedan is an excellent way of building tension , and the music used to underscore the film is suitably composed . I do n't know why there are some people who hate this movie so . Different strokes for different folks , I suppose . But I absolutely enjoyed ' Freeway ' and I can strongly recommend it .",263,1,0.00044444444444448447,0.00044444444444448447,0.00044444444444448447,0.00044444444444448447,0.00044444444444448447,0.00044444444444448447,0.00044444444444448447,0.00044444444444448447,0.00044444444444448447,0.00044444444444448447,0.00044444444444448447,0.00044444444444448447,0.00044444444444448447,0.00044444444444448447,0.00044444444444448447,0.00044444444444448447,0.00044444444444448447,0.049253183185851285,0.00044444444444448447,0.05288210739021572,0.3928688339834709,0.15860600671238106,0.00044444444444448447,0.00044444444444448447,0.00044444444444448447,0.00044444444444448447,0.00044444444444448447,0.00044444444444448447,0.00044444444444448447,0.041619398995774895,0.00044444444444448447,0.00044444444444448447,0.02928595608847466,0.00044444444444448447,0.00044444444444448447,0.00044444444444448447,0.00044444444444448447,0.00044444444444448447,0.02565973325020722,0.00044444444444448447,0.00044444444444448447,0.00044444444444448447,0.00044444444444448447,0.23115811372695586,0.00044444444444448447,0.00044444444444448447,0.00044444444444448447,0.00044444444444448447,0.00044444444444448447,0.00044444444444448447,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

45971,0,Atlantis was much better than I had anticipated . In some ways it had a better story than come of the other films aimed at a higher age . Although this film did demand a solid attention span at times . It was a great film for all ages . I noticed some of the younger audience expected a comedy but got an adventure . I think everyone is tired of an endless parade of extreme parodies . A lot of these kids have seen nothing but parodies . After a short time everyone seemed very intensely watching Atlantis .,100,1,0.0008695652173913524,0.0008695652173913524,0.0008695652173913524,0.0008695652173913524,0.0008695652173913524,0.047097951694443876,0.0008695652173913524,0.0008695652173913524,0.0008695652173913524,0.0008695652173913524,0.0008695652173913524,0.0008695652173913524,0.0008695652173913524,0.0008695652173913524,0.0008695652173913524,0.0008695652173913524,0.0008695652173913524,0.0008695652173913524,0.0008695652173913524,0.0008695652173913524,0.11828327737073538,0.0008695652173913524,0.0008695652173913524,0.0008695652173913524,0.0008695652173913524,0.0008695652173913524,0.0008695652173913524,0.0008695652173913524,0.0008695652173913524,0.0008695652173913524,0.0008695652173913524,0.0008695652173913524,0.0008695652173913524,0.0008695652173913524,0.0851750316692631,0.0008695652173913524,0.0008695652173913524,0.0008695652173913524,0.0008695652173913524,0.0008695652173913524,0.0008695652173913524,0.0008695652173913524,0.0008695652173913524,0.40226729835515324,0.30804600612779365,0.0008695652173913524,0.0008695652173913524,0.0008695652173913524,0.0008695652173913524,0.0008695652173913524,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0
46221,0,"One of the last classics of the French New Wave . For direction , cineaste Jean Eustache drew from the simplicity of early - century cinema ; for story , Eustache drew on the torments of his own complicated love life . So many things can be said of this film - observationally brilliant ; self indulgently overlong ; occasionally hilarious ; emotionally draining ... etc . etc . In my mind , whatever complaints that can be leveled against this film are easily overshadowed by its numerous strengths . Every film student , writer , or simply anyone willing to handle a 3 hour film with no abrupt cuts , no music video overstyling , no soap opera - like plot twists , and no banal dialogue should make it a point to see this movie . Everything is to be admired : the writing ( concise , clever , surprisingly funny ) , acting ( everyone , quite simply , is perfect in their respective roles ) , and , simple direction ( the viewer feels like a casual observer within the film ) make this film unforgettable . This is undoubtedly a film that stays with you .",201,1,0.000526315789473724,0.000526315789473724,0.000526315789473724,0.000526315789473724,0.05110495021243934,0.000526315789473724,0.000526315789473724,0.000526315789473724,0.000526315789473724,0.000526315789473724,0.000526315789473724,0.000526315789473724,0.000526315789473724,0.000526315789473724,0.000526315789473724,0.000526315789473724,0.03011558430253153,0.000526315789473724,0.000526315789473724,0.000526315789473724,0.14185660945295261,0.000526315789473724,0.000526315789473724,0.000526315789473724,0.000526315789473724,0.0210313979781912,0.000526315789473724,0.000526315789473724,0.000526315789473724,0.000526315789473724,0.000526315789473724,0.000526315789473724,0.000526315789473724,0.000526315789473724,0.000526315789473724,0.000526315789473724,0.000526315789473724,0.000526315789473724,0.000526315789473724,0.000526315789473724,0.000526315789473724,0.000526315789473724,0.000526315789473724,0.674957462932119,0.000526315789473724,0.05777610038492218,0.000526315789473724,0.000526315789473724,0.000526315789473724,0.000526315789473724,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0

46351,0,"Late , great Grade Z drive - in exploitation filmmaker par excellence Al Adamson really outdoes himself with this gloriously ghastly sci - fi soft - core musical comedy atrocity which plumbs deliciously dismal and dopey depths in sheer celluloid silliness and jaw - dropping stupidity . In the grim totalitarian future of 2047 sex has been deemed an illegal act by the Big Brother - like impotent bumbling idiot the Controller ( an amusingly goofy Erwin Fuller ) . However , sweet'n'sexy Cinderella ( radiant blonde cutie pie Catherine Erhardt ) remains determined to change things for the better . With the help of her effeminate Fairy Godfather ( a flamboyantly campy Jay B. Larson ) , Cinderella attends a grand gala ball with the specific plan of seducing handsome stud Tom Prince ( the dorky Vaughn Armstrong ) and teaching everyone that making love is a positive , pleasurable and wholly acceptable activity . Adamson directs this ridiculous yarn with his customary all - thumbs incompetence , staging the incredibly awful'n'inept song and dance sequences with a totally sidesplitting lack of skill and flair . The uproariously abysmal "" We All Need Love "" number with people in absurd animal costumes awkwardly prancing about the forest is a hilariously horrendous marvel ; ditto the equally abominable "" Mechnical Man "" routine featuring a bunch of clumsily cavorting robots . Louis Horvarth 's crude , static cinematography , the tacky plastic miniatures , Sparky Sugerman 's groovy throbbing disco score , the copious gratuitous nudity ( ravishing brunette hottie Sherri Coyle warrants special praise in this particular department ) , the brain - numbingly puerile attempts at leering lowbrow humor ( Roscoe the Robot law enforcer is especially irritating ) , and the uniformly terrible performances ( Renee Harmon 's outrageously hammy portrayal of Cinderella 's wicked overbearing stepmother cops the big booby prize here ) further enhance the strikingly abundant cheesiness to be savored in this delectably dreadful doozy .",332,1,0.0006896551724138597,0.0006896551724138597,0.0006896551724138597,0.0006896551724138597,0.06115310002269599,0.0006896551724138597,0.03517241388227662,0.0006896551724138597,0.0006896551724138597,0.0006896551724138597,0.0006896551724138597,0.0006896551724138597,0.0006896551724138597,0.0006896551724138597,0.0006896551724138597,0.0006896551724138597,0.0006896551724138597,0.0006896551724138597,0.0006896551724138597,0.0006896551724138597,0.6183271339790908,0.0006896551724138597,0.0006896551724138597,0.0006896551724138597,0.0006896551724138597,0.11906897166387644,0.0006896551724138597,0.0006896551724138597,0.0006896551724138597,0.0006896551724138597,0.0006896551724138597,0.0006896551724138597,0.0006896551724138597,0.0006896551724138597,0.0006896551724138597,0.0006896551724138597,0.0006896551724138597,0.0006896551724138597,0.0006896551724138597,0.10075031433654899,0.0006896551724138597,0.03518323852930152,0.0006896551724138597,0.0006896551724138597,0.0006896551724138597,0.0006896551724138597,0.0006896551724138597,0.0006896551724138597,0.0006896551724138597,0.0006896551724138597,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
46437,0,"I read thru most of the comments posted here & all I can say it that most of these posters have major problems in life . This show , unlike most game show , was fun . Mr. Shatner , whose brill in ALL that he does , was again the hit of the show . He 's genuinely bubbly personality shines like a beacon where ever he goes . He 's fun & makes you smile & that 's exactly what the show does also . The dancers & questions , the round - about fashion they 're presented only add to the shows appeal . And even though there 's a Great deal of money at stake it 's fun . The pressure ( stress ) that exists in most game shows does NOT exist here . Several people who posted messages complained how much time is waisted with the dancers & choosing questions , & c , like Millionaire does n't have similar time wasters . All I can say is most of you have missed the whole concept . The idea here is to have FUN & ENJOY yourself . There 's something for everyone . Qustions to test your knowledge , eye candy ( the dancers ) , suspense , Mr. Shatner 's wonderful fun - filled personality ... well if that does n't perk - up guys up then I feel bad for you ; and if that 's not enough , YOU CAN GET RICH ! I really miss the show . Out of ALL the games shows that have ever been on , & to be quite frank , I HATE game shows , this is the one I really liked & truly miss .

46782,0,I was pretty surprised with this flick . Even though their budjet was obviously lacking still you have to be impressed that this movie took 7 years to make and still turned out good . The acting was pretty impressive and the story really captivated me . My only complaint would be that the ending really was a little too abrupt for my taste . But hey if your audience is left wanting more then this movie has succeeded . I would really recommend anyone in Hollywood to look up Antonella Ríos who is an excellent Spanish talent ( something hard to find now days with all the bad novela over acting ) . Antonella Ríos truly is a star on the rise .,124,1,0.0006896551724138459,0.0006896551724138459,0.03037907458275425,0.0006896551724138459,0.0006896551724138459,0.0290639650905981,0.0006896551724138459,0.0006896551724138459,0.0006896551724138459,0.0006896551724138459,0.0006896551724138459,0.0006896551724138459,0.0006896551724138459,0.0006896551724138459,0.0006896551724138459,0.0006896551724138459,0.0006896551724138459,0.0006896551724138459,0.0006896551724138459,0.0006896551724138459,0.0006896551724138459,0.6062323852842317,0.0006896551724138459,0.0006896551724138459,0.0006896551724138459,0.0006896551724138459,0.0006896551724138459,0.0006896551724138459,0.0006896551724138459,0.0006896551724138459,0.0006896551724138459,0.0006896551724138459,0.0006896551724138459,0.0006896551724138459,0.0006896551724138459,0.0006896551724138459,0.0006896551724138459,0.0006896551724138459,0.04100040106960837,0.0006896551724138459,0.04064157771541431,0.0006896551724138459,0.0006896551724138459,0.22233776867118415,0.0006896551724138459,0.0006896551724138459,0.0006896551724138459,0.0006896551724138459,0.0006896551724138459,0.0006896551724138459,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
46919,0,"Peter O'Toole is a treat to watch in roles where the lines he speaks are good and offer a chance for him to swagger in drunken stupor . The lovely Susannah York provides a good foil for O'Toole 's dramatic presence . The film alludes to incest -- without a single explicit scene -- but it is able to entertain the viewer in its raucous social commentary . Though this is not major film by any reckoning , it will be remembered for its entertaining performances . Even York , signing the papers at the end , is a treat to watch , exuding tragedy silently . The possible weakness here is Thompson 's laid - back direction . But the film floats because of the actors and the script . I saw the film twice over a period of 20 years -- on both occasions with the name "" Brotherly love "" . "" Country dance "" is a rather farcical and inappropriate title for this movie , wherever it was released as such .",176,1,0.0008000000000000655,0.0008000000000000655,0.0008000000000000655,0.0008000000000000655,0.0008000000000000655,0.0008000000000000655,0.0008000000000000655,0.0008000000000000655,0.0008000000000000655,0.0008000000000000655,0.0008000000000000655,0.0008000000000000655,0.0008000000000000655,0.0008000000000000655,0.0008000000000000655,0.0008000000000000655,0.0008000000000000655,0.0008000000000000655,0.04080000000000151,0.0008000000000000655,0.0008000000000000655,0.327839592623632,0.0008000000000000655,0.0008000000000000655,0.0008000000000000655,0.03936860899612768,0.0008000000000000655,0.0008000000000000655,0.0008000000000000655,0.0008000000000000655,0.0008000000000000655,0.0008000000000000655,0.0008000000000000655,0.0008000000000000655,0.0008000000000000655,0.0008000000000000655,0.0008000000000000655,0.0008000000000000655,0.0008000000000000655,0.0008000000000000655,0.05524673088544747,0.0008000000000000655,0.0008000000000000655,0.5007450674947885,0.0008000000000000655,0.0008000000000000655,0.0008000000000000655,0.0008000000000000655,0.0008000000000000655,0.0008000000000000655,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

47247,0,""" The Notorious Bettie Page "" is about a woman who always wanted to be an actress but instead became one of the most famous pin up girls in the history of America . Bettie Page played by Gretchen Mol was one of the first sex icons in America . The type of modeling Bettie Page took part in included nudity and bondage which lead to a U.S Senate investigation in the 1950s . Walking out of the film , all I could think about was how far we have come in terms of pornography since the 1950s . You can go on the internet now and find some of most disturbing and shocking images ever shot , that the footage questioned in "" The Notorious Bettie Page "" seems almost childlike and innocent . Most of the footage including the bondage did not feature nudity when Bettie Page was involved yet today we have sick images where we can see women having sex with animals . I find that maybe the envelope has been pushed a little too far since the 1950s because looking at this movie in terms of today 's pornography , it was very tastefully done . To be honest , I was pretty impressed with "" The Notorious Bettie Page , "" I found the film to be very well done and interesting . The movie is exactly what the trailer leads you to believe it will be and is a very interesting look at one of the first female sex icons in America . Gretchen Mol looks just like Bettie Page and gives a very fine performance . I also thought that since the movie was shot in black and white it made the film seem realistic because it made the audience believe they were watching a film created in the late 1950s . My only complaint about the film was the running time , there seemed to be a few scenes that were cut and seemed to be a little shorter than they should have been . I looked this up and it seems that 10 minutes was cut from the film since its original showing at the Toronto Film Festival . Also the ending was pretty tame and I was expecting a little more from it or maybe some paragraphs to come on the screen to tell the audience more about Bettie Page 's life where the film left off . Those are my only two complaints about the film other than that the directing was solid , the acting was great especially Gretchen , and the writing was good . Mary Harron , who directed "" American Psycho "" , which is one of my favorite films , is the director and writer of "" The Notorious Bettie Page . "" I feel that Mary is a very talented director who knows how to create a setting and create great movies based on characters because like "" Psycho "" , Bettie Page is a character study and a fine one at that . Harron captures the 40s and 50s with ease as well as all the characters . She is a very talented director who I hope will be around for many years to come . Bottom Line : "" The Notorious Bettie Page "" is definitely worth a look . It 's a very interesting story that shows how far America , as well as the world , has come in terms of pornography . The film also provides a fine performance by Gretchen Mol who literally nails the role of Bettie Page on the head . And top it off with a talented director who was able to capture the look and feel of a previous era and you have a good movie on your hands . Sadly , this film is probably going to flop since not many besides people who grew up in this era will show interest in the film but I think it 's worth checking out . MovieManMenzel 's final rating for "" The Notorious Bettie Page "" is a 8/10 . It 's an interesting character study about one of the most famous pin up girls and sex icons in American history .",710,1,0.0001333333333333473,0.0001333333333333473,0.0001333333333333473,0.013445955668506114,0.009036554389461904,0.0001333333333333473,0.0001333333333333473,0.03536761389713627,0.0001333333333333473,0.0001333333333333473,0.0001333333333333473,0.0001333333333333473,0.0001333333333333473,0.0001333333333333473,0.008119587436290284,0.0001333333333333473,0.0001333333333333473,0.0001333333333333473,0.006791420088856429,0.0001333333333333473,0.116430408219554,0.11786561961065316,0.0001333333333333473,0.0001333333333333473,0.0001333333333333473,0.0001333333333333473,0.0001333333333333473,0.0001333333333333473,0.0001333333333333473,0.0001333333333333473,0.0001333333333333473,0.026466012609462748,0.0001333333333333473,0.0001333333333333473,0.0001333333333333473,0.058809227871002845,0.14392434710145555,0.0001333333333333473,0.0356397621199294,0.0001333333333333473,0.01802790329102377,0.0001333333333333473,0.0001333333333333473,0.40514225436333345,0.0001333333333333473,0.0001333333333333473,0.0001333333333333473,0.0001333333333333473,0.0001333333333333473,0.0001333333333333473,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

48859,0,"Jiøí Trnka made his last animated short an indictment of totalitarism , which caused him trouble in his native Czechoslovakia . The elements are few , the symbolisms simple , and his trademark ornaments almost absent here , allowing the viewer to concentrate on the fable . A man in his room dedicates to pottery and to take care of his only plant . But suddenly a huge hand enters the room and orders him to make a statue of itself . The man refuses and he 's persecuted by the ominous gloved hand .

As a man married for 26 years , I empathize with Patrick Warburton 's character : he loves his wife , but he assumes she knows that . I also enjoy his monotone delivery ; never gets too excited or too low . A nice ensemble of characters . This will be a nice addition to the Monday night line - up .

49116,0,"The story for Hare Rama Hare Krishna actually came to Dev Anand 's mind when he saw hippies and their fallen values in Kathmandu where he was on a visit after the protests against his previous Prem Pujari in Calcutta . He was low in spirits because his film had been opposed and some had burnt Prem Pujari 's posters . But the life of hippies re ignited a story in Dev 's mind to be made into a film . This was Dev Anand 's perhaps best directorial effort . The film was a blockbuster super hit at the box office and Zeenat Aman as Dev 's sister made a tremendous impact . This film was Dev Anand 's call to the nation to keep up their moral values . It is about a Montereal based Indian family and the brother 's role is a very affectionate one for his sister . But the parents quarrel and separate leaving Prashant(Dev ) with mother and Jasbir(Zeenat ) with father . She is repeatedly told that her mother and brother are dead and she eventually believes that she will never see Prashant again . She is ill treated by her step mother and she runs away from home . Dev grows up to be a pilot and he learns that Jasbir is in Kathmandu with certain hippies . To reunite with his sister , Dev travels to Kathmandu and meets Shanti(Mumtaz ) who was to later marry him and also Janice who in reality is Jasbir with a new name and new identity . She has forgotten her childhood and Dev too . Dev has to get his sister back amongst all other happenings which include his being suspected as a thief in Kathmandu and the people are after his life . This was a story well directed and acted - both by Dev Anand . We see more of Zeenat Aman than of Mumtaz . But the music by Rahul Dev Burman was well composed . Dev had first offered the music to be composed by Sachin Dev Burman but Burman Da did not want Dev to do the film . He was very close to Dev and his earlier film Prem Pujari , though was good , but had been opposed in Calcutta . Burman Da wanted Dev to try a lighter subject as he thought hippie cultist film might reignite people 's anger against Dev . But Dev continued with the film reassuring Burman Da and the film was indeed a success . R D Burman had Asha Bhosle sing the award winning Dum Maro Dum . Kanchi re Kanchi re was another good number . Overall it is a good film .",455,1,0.10658306460622455,0.0003703703703704027,0.0003703703703704027,0.0003703703703704027,0.0003703703703704027,0.0003703703703704027,0.0003703703703704027,0.0003703703703704027,0.0003703703703704027,0.0003703703703704027,0.0003703703703704027,0.0003703703703704027,0.0003703703703704027,0.0003703703703704027,0.0003703703703704027,0.0003703703703704027,0.0664561441483594,0.0003703703703704027,0.0003703703703704027,0.0003703703703704027,0.0003703703703704027,0.0003703703703704027,0.0003703703703704027,0.0003703703703704027,0.0003703703703704027,0.0003703703703704027,0.07867462876553452,0.0003703703703704027,0.04027157256871486,0.0003703703703704027,0.0003703703703704027,0.0003703703703704027,0.053561124547788656,0.0003703703703704027,0.0003703703703704027,0.0003703703703704027,0.0003703703703704027,0.0003703703703704027,0.0003703703703704027,0.0003703703703704027,0.0003703703703704027,0.10706846107527172,0.0003703703703704027,0.4061949172747067,0.0003703703703704027,0.12563453145784254,0.0003703703703704027,0.0003703703703704027,0.0003703703703704027,0.0003703703703704027,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0
49374,0,"When a movie shocks you with it 's disturbing , brooding atmosphere , and grabs you by the throat with it 's stunning cinematography , you just know that you have stumbled upon a treat , masterpiece of a film . Although with most modern movies , extremely enjoyable as some are , those that really shock you into focus are the strongest , and are the ones that are most critically acclaimed and mostly , stick with you for a life time . I say , proudly , that I am a fan of movies that disturb , not just horror movies , but those that send a vibe laden with foreboding . Movies like Breakdown and The Missing , that send a chill down your spine , making you think "" holy crap , that could happen to me "" , and visually entice you , are up there with some of my favorite aspects in a movie . Because I am only 21 , I did not grow up with actors like Burt Renyolds , Jon Voight and Ned Beatty , albeit I am familiar with them , I did n't watch them grow and proceed as actors , as opposed to actors now like Shia LaBouf and Justin Long . I must say , after the long hype and witnessing Deliverance for the first time , I was so admired by these veteran actors in a movie made more than 30 years ago , and still lives it 's terror up in competition to modern movies . Burt Renyolds plays Lewis , the macho self appointed leader of a group of four friends on a canoe trip down a fictitious river before a dam is made , filling the whole wilderness in water . Renyolds ' character is an experienced adventurer , sort of no nonsense , and filled with machismo . Witnessing him portray the tough guy , made me think differently about him as an actor , as i have only seen him as a seedy old guy or an angry politician . The dialog the director provides for his character gives him enough malice to be proved as a strong and even intimidating leader . Ronny Cox and Ned Beatty play as the novice adventurers , Drew and Bob respectively , joining in for the fun of a canoe trip . The actor that i thoroughly enjoyed watching was Jon Voight , once again I have only seen him as an older actor , however , unlike Renyolds , I have quite liked Voight 's acting ( and i do n't regard Anaconda when I say that ) , for example the national treasure movies . Voight plays Ed , whom , like Lewis , is experienced in adventuring but is seen as a more reserved character , a reluctant hero/ leader and definitely lacks Lewis ' machismo . The film basically opens up with the four driving into a small town while asking to find someone to drive their cars to the bottom of the river whilst they canoe the rapids and camp along the riverside . You immediately get a creepy vibe from the hillbilly characters we are introduced to , like the imbred kid who plays the infamous "" Duelling Banjo 's "" at the start of the film with Ronny Cox 's character Drew ; and more so the two mountain men in the films pivotal and disturbing rape scene . As with all atmospheric movies , from this moment on , dread and confusion fills the characters as well as the audience and it is here we see the characters take shape and change form . The canoe trip that follows is expertly shot and it is from here the men fight against both human and nature 's odds for survival . The film 's cinematics do not let up , and I back that comment up with the scene in which Ed fights one of the rapist mountain men with a composite bow . As Ed falls on to one of his arrows and notices his enemy approaching him , cocks his rifle , only to shoot the floor as he falls with an arrow in his neck ; was possible the greatest piece of cinematic shooting I have seen in a film . In wrapping up , Deliverance is one film , who 's dread and atmosphere carry the mood across and to this date , remains one of the best films in cinematic history .",760,1,0.00018181818181819783,0.00018181818181819783,0.00018181818181819783,0.00018181818181819783,0.00018181818181819783,0.00018181818181819783,0.00018181818181819783,0.10372163928599158,0.00018181818181819783,0.00018181818181819783,0.00018181818181819783,0.00018181818181819783,0.00018181818181819783,0.00018181818181819783,0.00018181818181819783,0.00018181818181819783,0.00018181818181819783,0.00018181818181819783,0.009272724917612612,0.00018181818181819783,0.49083445792927166,0.016766886089862886,0.00018181818181819783,0.00018181818181819783,0.010756654599814631,0.00018181818181819783,0.00018181818181819783,0.00018181818181819783,0.00018181818181819783,0.00018181818181819783,0.00018181818181819783,0.006436070428022089,0.00018181818181819783,0.00018181818181819783,0.00018181818181819783,0.00018181818181819783,0.00018181818181819783,0.00018181818181819783,0.00018181818181819783,0.00018181818181819783,0.024437979293917115,0.01304919429031363,0.012027030647191015,0.2904397753827983,0.015166678044294678,0.00018181818181819783,0.00018181818181819783,0.00018181818181819783,0.00018181818181819783,0.00018181818181819783,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0
49376,0,"Before watching this film I had heard a lot about it and certain scenes in the film , but listening was n't doing it for me so I planned on watching it and wow ! Ned Beatty , Ronny Cox , Jon Voight and Burt Reynolds make for an interesting group of individuals who are hell bent on canoing down the Cahulawassee river and the unfortunate series of events that transpires upon them all . The character development takes some time in enveloping the viewer with a better understanding of each person , but eventually you know these guys like they were your friend . The acting , dialogue is very very real , as close to reality as you can get for Hollywood acting . Reynolds character "" Lewis "" was interesting as a guy who comes off very tough but underneath the manly veneer lies a very soft and broken man ( I was impressed with his performance ! ) Jon Voight seems to be the character that s on the spotlight the most , the unfortunate circumstances that seem to find him at every corner really mold and caste him into a different man at the end ( his character transition was excellent ) . Ned Beatty and Ronny Cox really seem like the silly lunkheads that just like to joke around and do n't seem to get too awful serious unless they have too , and they did ... I really was amazed at Director Boorman 's vision of Dickey 's novel , very impressed . You can not go your whole life without watching this film .

49801,0,"I saw this film on True Movies ( which automatically made me sceptical ) but actually - it was good . Why ? Not because of the amazing plot twists or breathtaking dialogue ( of which there is little ) but because actually , despite what people say I thought the film was accurate in it 's depiction of teenagers dealing with pregnancy . It 's NOT Dawson 's Creek , they 're not graceful , cool witty characters who breeze through sexuality with effortless knowledge . They 're kids and they act like kids would . They 're blunt , awkward and annoyingly confused about everything . Yes , this could be by accident and they could just be bad actors but I do n't think so . Dermot Mulroney gives ( when not trying to be cool ) a very believable performance and I loved him for it . Patricia Arquette IS whiny and annoying , but she was pregnant and a teenagers ? The combination of the two is n't exactly lavender on your pillow . The plot was VERY predictable and but so what ? I believed them , his stress and inability to cope - her brave , yet slightly misguided attempts to bring them closer together . I think the characters , acted by anyone else , WOULD indeed have been annoying and unbelievable but they were n't . It reflects the surreality of the situation they 're in , that he 's sitting in class and she walks on campus with the baby . I felt angry at her for that , I felt angry at him for being such a child and for blaming her . I felt it all . In the end , I loved it and would recommend it . Watch out for the scene where Dermot Mulroney runs from the disastrous counselling session - career performance .",319,1,0.0004255319148936515,0.0004255319148936515,0.0004255319148936515,0.0004255319148936515,0.0004255319148936515,0.08872449458941539,0.06425531932115901,0.0004255319148936515,0.0004255319148936515,0.0004255319148936515,0.0004255319148936515,0.02617248604188083,0.0004255319148936515,0.0004255319148936515,0.0004255319148936515,0.0004255319148936515,0.0004255319148936515,0.0004255319148936515,0.0004255319148936515,0.0004255319148936515,0.32110370419133955,0.1387669064745109,0.0004255319148936515,0.0004255319148936515,0.0004255319148936515,0.0004255319148936515,0.0004255319148936515,0.0004255319148936515,0.0004255319148936515,0.022398344740318692,0.0004255319148936515,0.0004255319148936515,0.0004255319148936515,0.0004255319148936515,0.0004255319148936515,0.0004255319148936515,0.0004255319148936515,0.0004255319148936515,0.0004255319148936515,0.0004255319148936515,0.0004255319148936515,0.02238519866581972,0.0004255319148936515,0.29832120555002256,0.0004255319148936515,0.0004255319148936515,0.0004255319148936515,0.0004255319148936515,0.0004255319148936515,0.0004255319148936515,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
50012,1,"The Half - way mark This is the sixth book in the Left Behind series . It is also the first one in the series I did not finish in one sitting . It did not flow as well as the others , so as to lend itself to a complete reading in one evening . The book also spends a lot of time re - telling what we read in previous books . I felt this time like I read half a novel . The book starts in the thirty - eighth month into the tribulation . But most of the characters seem a little too self serving in this book . Allowing their own desires to guide their actions . Whether that desire be derived from rage , revenge , self pity , or even guilt . Rayford spends most of his time focusing on Hattie or his desire to kill the Anti - Christ . Though I do like the description of the handgun that Rayford procures . And when the time comes for the assassination , there are a few characters to chose from . The book ends in an old time cliff hanger where you are left guessing who it is that assassinated the Anti - Christ . Stay tuned for the next volume . I have read this far , so I will finish the series .

Founder of the Grameen Bank , he and his collaborators in many coutries throughout the world ( including the US and Canada ) have shown that lending to the poor , helping them realize their own potential and giving them the support network they need to succeed is having dramatic results wherever it is tried . Yunnus ' book is inspiring and an eye - opener . It made me realize that professionals working in large international charity organizations can not bring about genuine change unless their offices and employees live and work among the people they are trying to help . It 's hard to separate the book from the idea . One is as fascinating as the other .

50022,1,"Closer to healthy than atkins , but not quite there . The Paleo Diet is based on an interesting premise- the idea that what we ate before agriculture suited our needs perfectly because our bodies had been bred by evolution in response to our what we could find to eat in our environment . It seems like a giant leap to assume our paleolithic ancestors naturally gravitated towards exactly what we need to eat . Animals in the wild do make sensible choices most of the time , because their decisions are instinctual . Self - awareness creates a problem that does n't exist for other animal behavior as it does for humans . Sometimes we do things out of curiosity , or laziness , or false beliefs . So , considering the erratic behavior of present - day humans , who is to say our paleolithic ancestors were any more intuitive about their nutritive needs ? Even the book suggests humans ate what they did out of trial and error , frequently just trying whatever they encountered in the wild . The fact that wild foods are frequently much richer in nutrients than domestic foods does not mean that you must subscribe to a strict paleolithic diet to take advantage of this fact . Rather , eat more wild - sourced food . Just about anything edible from the wild will be a healthy food , unless the environment from which it comes is polluted- and that is a very real problem . Meat is a very dodgy thing nowadays , not like it was in the pristine wilderness of the paleolithic era . The Paleo diet would be a healthy thing if we were still in that world . Now , we need to worry about heavy metals in fish flesh , and antibiotics and growth hormones in feedlot animals . Beef will have some naturally occuring omega 3 if the animals were allowed to wander in a more or less natural fashion , as they did when the most commonly employed mechanism for animal control was the cowboy . This is no longer true . The average cut of meat in your supermarket is taken from a feedlot animal , fed the wrong food and in conditions unsanitary in the extreme . Basing a diet on meat in this day and age can be dangerous . You must choose your meat sources carefully . Meat made from free - range animals raised on pesticide - free in a caring manner can be very hard to find . I found Loren 's rejection of all products of agricultural development a little too simple minded , and in some cases irresponsible . There is nothing at all unhealthy about whole grain foods or legumes consumed in moderation , and significant weight loss could occur for most people if they ingested organic whole grains and legumes but conscientiously avoided only the major evil products of agriculture : high fructose corn syrup , trans - fatty acids , artifical sweeteners , uncleaned foods raised non - organically with pesticides and herbicides , and improperly raised food animals . My main objection to the book is nearly one hundred pages ( about half ) of the book is dedicated to the spiel- convincing you this thing is real and valid and worth your time . I think the forward to the book or perhaps the first chapter alone would have been sufficient for that purpose . After a while you get the feeling Loren is trying too hard to sell this idea to you , and it really interferes with the flow of the book . Further , a lot ( but not all ) of the studies cited show only marginal advantages of different aspects of this diet . The claims that you will experience great weight loss and feel better than you ever have are quite nice to imagine , and peppered throughout the book . But it 's hard to believe with the less than overwhelming studies cited . One last nitpick . One great way to compensate for the lack of typical food taste enhancers like salt and sugar is the use of herbs and spices . something very much like the paleo diet already exists as part of peasant cuisines around the world . It 's a pity the recipes included do not explore those , but instead offer somewhat watered down and uninspired fare instead . Espscially asian cuisines frequently make due with alot of the ingredients that are ok on the paleo diet , and their interesting spices make it all the more entertaining . I found the recipes far too traditional and western - centric .",792,0,0.46040171760273974,0.0357980168470667,0.026320947232459316,0.00018691588785048558,0.01652658246606456,0.00018691588785048558,0.00018691588785048558,0.08925034175778519,0.00018691588785048558,0.00018691588785048558,0.00018691588785048558,0.00018691588785048558,0.019446347765901584,0.00018691588785048558,0.011950145948273544,0.00018691588785048558,0.00018691588785048558,0.00018691588785048558,0.00018691588785048558,0.00018691588785048558,0.00018691588785048558,0.00018691588785048558,0.020837056939704987,0.00018691588785048558,0.013522455179699069,0.00018691588785048558,0.00018691588785048558,0.00018691588785048558,0.00018691588785048558,0.00018691588785048558,0.00018691588785048558,0.00018691588785048558,0.00018691588785048558,0.00018691588785048558,0.03203454040142298,0.00018691588785048558,0.15381315962788383,0.00018691588785048558,0.00018691588785048558,0.00018691588785048558,0.00018691588785048558,0.00018691588785048558,0.00018691588785048558,0.00018691588785048558,0.11299588449267997,0.00018691588785048558,0.00018691588785048558,0.00018691588785048558,0.00018691588785048558,0.00018691588785048558,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

50066,1,"At least one story told wrong I 'm an avid reader of history , as well as processing a degree in the subject . So imagine my surprise when , after receiving this book from a friend of mine for Christmas , I read the erroneous account of the Children 's Crusade of 1212 . I had done research on this topic , so I was horrified to read the completely inaccurate account of what occurred . Had the author not read any historical analysis on the subject from the last 50 years ? If he had , he would have realized that there were actually two crusades - one consisting of mainly French people led by Stephen of Cloyes who , when told to turn back by King Philip II , did so . That ended that crusade . The other one , led by a shepherd from Germany named Nicholas , led a group across the Alps into Italy . Some left for home while others continued on to Rome . It 's interesting to note that in Rome , many received dispensations from their crusading vows because these "" children "" were either too old or because they were pregnant . Perhaps until relatively recently , people believed in the Children 's Crusade because it represented a morality play or because some historians gave too much credit to chronicles ( like Chronica Albrici monachi Trium Fontium ) which were written long after the crusade supposedly occurred , rather than relying on more contemporary sources . Nor did they realize that the latin word "" pueri "" used in the chronicles can have several meanings ( such as unmarried men rather than children ) . In the final analysis , you just ca n't rely on books like these to really teach you history . The best you can do is read what they tell you and then try to verify it . If only the author had bothered to check the History Channel 's own account of the Children 's Crusade on their website , or perhaps read the excellent paper done by Peter Raedts in the Journal of Medieval History , or even just checked out the brief but accurate entry online in wikipedia . The book gave two pages to this event , and sadly got it completely wrong . For this gross oversight , I am compelled to give it one star . Readers of history , never just believe what you read - verify",421,0,0.0002898550724637962,0.018860457130444968,0.0002898550724637962,0.0002898550724637962,0.0002898550724637962,0.0002898550724637962,0.0002898550724637962,0.027524421599925332,0.03315159007582447,0.0002898550724637962,0.0002898550724637962,0.014782608695650104,0.23432588128434786,0.0002898550724637962,0.0002898550724637962,0.0002898550724637962,0.0002898550724637962,0.0002898550724637962,0.0002898550724637962,0.0002898550724637962,0.0002898550724637962,0.0002898550724637962,0.0002898550724637962,0.0002898550724637962,0.0002898550724637962,0.0002898550724637962,0.04031964783197145,0.0002898550724637962,0.0002898550724637962,0.0002898550724637962,0.0002898550724637962,0.07155068720801162,0.0002898550724637962,0.0002898550724637962,0.1107605211536715,0.0002898550724637962,0.31435268572255215,0.0002898550724637962,0.0002898550724637962,0.0002898550724637962,0.017173242760899075,0.0002898550724637962,0.0002898550724637962,0.0002898550724637962,0.04284670292302094,0.06333706086005639,0.0002898550724637962,0.0002898550724637962,0.0002898550724637962,0.0002898550724637962,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0

50075,1,"Another not -so- helpful rant It is sad that this is what passes for political commentary now . Coulter 's work demonstrates exactly the potential danger for degrading society and disdain for thinking that people like Ms. Coulter piously / hypocritically rail against .

Why must political discussion turn to childish name calling in order to convince self - selected audiences of something they already want to believe . Pitiful rants here . If you are in it for fun or do n't care that you are getting a skewed , sensationalist opinion , maybe you should read a few paragraphs of this in the book store .

50108,1,"WORD GAMES AGELESS BODY is Deepak 's attempt to neutralize the word "" old "" as in old age . The writer has a knack for making common words , like "" body , "" mind "" and "" self , "" into profound concepts . His technique is to overlay his abstract ideas with suggestive experimental studies . But ambiguity in interpreting these studies abound . If you like poetry , Deepak may be your read : "" The billions of changes occurring in our cells are only the passing scenery of life ; ( P. 36 ) "" Or try to interpret this one : "" The emptiness at the core of every atom is the womb of the universe ; in the flicker of thought when two neurons interact there is an opportunity for a new world to be born . ( P.40 ) "" At times he attributes to cells and DNA a creative intelligence to direct their own construction and at other times his designer is invisible . He would make a great spokesman for the current hocus pocus over "" intelligent design . "" He ca n't accept the growth of any cell , even a plant cell , without an intelligence involved . He mentions and attacks evolution only one time on P. 115 , asserting that the growth of a cell could never be a random process . Deepak ends up in the very same thought circle as every other writer who tries to explain life in scientific terms : Intelligence is a self organizing entity and every cell evolved is only intelligence having a conversation with itself . Whether your word game tosses in the word "" quantum "" or not does n't change much . What a solipsistic thought ; what a solipsistic world . I wonder if his readers who actually experienced the oneness Deepak speaks of would n't , after awhile , go insane",326,0,0.3897084204806606,0.03211140426842027,0.0004878048780488219,0.0004878048780488219,0.021020751174779233,0.0004878048780488219,0.0004878048780488219,0.29827837557157805,0.028046430794517564,0.0004878048780488219,0.0004878048780488219,0.0004878048780488219,0.0004878048780488219,0.0004878048780488219,0.0004878048780488219,0.0004878048780488219,0.0004878048780488219,0.0004878048780488219,0.0004878048780488219,0.0004878048780488219,0.0004878048780488219,0.0004878048780488219,0.0004878048780488219,0.054142888243621144,0.0004878048780488219,0.0004878048780488219,0.0004878048780488219,0.0004878048780488219,0.0004878048780488219,0.0004878048780488219,0.0004878048780488219,0.0004878048780488219,0.0004878048780488219,0.0004878048780488219,0.027261095157246125,0.0004878048780488219,0.10232644235598187,0.0004878048780488219,0.0004878048780488219,0.0004878048780488219,0.0004878048780488219,0.0004878048780488219,0.0004878048780488219,0.0004878048780488219,0.0004878048780488219,0.0004878048780488219,0.027104191953193316,0.0004878048780488219,0.0004878048780488219,0.0004878048780488219,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

50114,1,"Not realistic for most people While I found the writing style good and the information interesting , the actual diet was unrealistic , too restrictive and lacking fun basics that make other diets tolerable . I found myself longing for spices ( how bad could pepper really be ? ) and questioning the validity of their restriction . I could n't stand the ground - up flax seeds in my cranberry cocktail - the texture reminded me of trying to drink mud with little bugs in it ( or what I imagine that to be).I'm not writing this to disparage anyone from trying the diet - if you can handle the restrictions and you have the self - control required , you might find this diet doable and rewarding . I tried the Fat Flush with a group from work - inspired by one woman who is able to do the flush again and again every year ( she always gains the weight back ) . The rest of us , while successful for varying degrees of short periods , found the diet unrealistic for any long - term results - all of us gained the weight back and spurred by instant weight loss , some even picked up worse habits than they began with . The funny thing is I found much of the health information useful or interesting , but I got rid of the book b / c sitting on my shelf it reminded me of unrealistic goals and failure - not what I want out of a get - healthy plan .

50121,1,"A wallowing , depressing and ugly book with no redeeming value whatsoever This is the worst , most depressing piece of fiction I have ever read . There is no real protoganist and not one singular character worthy of admiration -- and after a while , their actions just become inexplicable . The author 's soul must truly be an ugly one to have devoted so much time and energy to using his mind to generate so many casual acts of evil throughout the book . It starts out promising but by the time you get to about halfway through the book or so you get a nagging sense that your very own soul might be sucked out of you and permanently stolen by the heart of Neil Gaiman 's darkness or one of his minions . Additionally , the characters ' motivations change like the shifting sands , nothing they do makes any real sense except some inexplicable movement towards doing greater and more evil en masse like some sort of coagulating bacteria or disease . What is so creepy about this book is the casualness of it all . Unlike some of Stephen King 's work ( ie : The Stand ) , there is absolutely no redeeming thread here -- no rallying or marshalling the troops to combat the emerging evil . It 's evil in evil vs. evil surrounded by evil . All I can say is that this book is ugly , ugly , ugly . At least writers like Joyce Carol Oats and Joseph Conrad 's intentions when writing about such things is to effectively demonstrate the ill effects of such darkness , but to make heroes of characters one should avoid is unconscionable . The choices the supposed protoganist makes make no sense -- and you do root for him in the very beginning but you find he is just like one of them after all . I suspended my doubt and disbelief as long as I could but finally became so incensed by the audacity of both the literary critics and the author to pass this off as excellence , I literally stopped mid - sentence and chose to never read this author 's work again . It 's a shame too because he has allied himself in other incarnations with a truly gifted artist , Dave McKean , who maybe has n't completely gone over to the dark side like Neil has . His association with Dave McKean is the only reason I even opened - up the book -- and maybe a little because the title intrigued me . But it 's unfortunate that the industry rewards "" clever "" works such as Mr. Gaiman 's with undue praise . I 've never so strongly disliked a book . Have you ever found yourself getting angry because you felt robbed or duped by a book ? Well , do n't believe the hype , this is the one to throw in the trash or disintegrate with X - men eyeball laserbeams before all your humanity is sucked out of you",520,0,0.23686209924741886,0.00025316455696205656,0.00025316455696205656,0.014573921039245718,0.00025316455696205656,0.00025316455696205656,0.014503669771001126,0.05493377193274022,0.00025316455696205656,0.00025316455696205656,0.00025316455696205656,0.00025316455696205656,0.11647265576177375,0.00025316455696205656,0.009695610146942927,0.00025316455696205656,0.00025316455696205656,0.00025316455696205656,0.00025316455696205656,0.00025316455696205656,0.00025316455696205656,0.00025316455696205656,0.00025316455696205656,0.00025316455696205656,0.00025316455696205656,0.00025316455696205656,0.00025316455696205656,0.00025316455696205656,0.00025316455696205656,0.013363910302618796,0.00025316455696205656,0.015339460576791933,0.00025316455696205656,0.00025316455696205656,0.1562484640916574,0.00025316455696205656,0.3441145913401354,0.00025316455696205656,0.00025316455696205656,0.00025316455696205656,0.00025316455696205656,0.00025316455696205656,0.00025316455696205656,0.00025316455696205656,0.00025316455696205656,0.00025316455696205656,0.014018428068153633,0.00025316455696205656,0.00025316455696205656,0.00025316455696205656,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
50122,1,"I really wanted to like this book If Julia Glass had not set the bar so high with Three Junes , I would have given the book 3 stars instead of 2 . There are sentences , paragraphs , even pages of brilliance in this book , but it is as if winning the National Book Award gave Ms. Glass unconditional confidence in her writing , and character development in particular . She seemed out of touch with the major demographics the narrative slings around . As another reviewer wrote , the writing process seemed transparant . Reading the book , you get the feeling that the characters are what Ms. Glass ( a privileged white woman of a certain age ) imagines teenagers , or New Mexicans , or black chauffeurs , or Hispanic nannies , or even gay people to be like . She is like a tourist who voyeuristically delights in other cultures without really understanding them . The teenagers and the Santa Fe inhabitants are the most painful examples of caricatures . Greenie might be the most believable , and although I understood why she was falling out of love with her gloomy Alan , I was n't sucked along with her when she falls in love with "" the other Charlie "" . He was only very mildly interesting and certainly not worth ( even temporarily ) losing your child over . With Saga , she manages to develop her most sympathetic character , but Saga 's life is left floating and unresolved at the end . Even the brief appearance of Fenno , who I loved in Three Junes , lacked intensity and seemed gimmicky . All and all , a very disappointing second novel . You have to wonder , since most reviewers are pointing out all of the same problems with character , what good is her editor ?",317,0,0.0004166666666666959,0.0004166666666666959,0.03222733180616724,0.0004166666666666959,0.0004166666666666959,0.02775935116792268,0.0004166666666666959,0.0004166666666666959,0.0004166666666666959,0.0004166666666666959,0.0004166666666666959,0.0004166666666666959,0.0004166666666666959,0.0004166666666666959,0.0004166666666666959,0.0004166666666666959,0.0004166666666666959,0.0004166666666666959,0.0004166666666666959,0.0004166666666666959,0.0004166666666666959,0.0004166666666666959,0.0004166666666666959,0.0004166666666666959,0.0004166666666666959,0.08501874870888729,0.0004166666666666959,0.0004166666666666959,0.0004166666666666959,0.0004166666666666959,0.0004166666666666959,0.0004166666666666959,0.0004166666666666959,0.0004166666666666959,0.06575200141020428,0.07239540729927386,0.6081585797383849,0.0004166666666666959,0.04899289838364567,0.0004166666666666959,0.0004166666666666959,0.021250000086127718,0.021362348066051765,0.0004166666666666959,0.0004166666666666959,0.0004166666666666959,0.0004166666666666959,0.0004166666666666959,0.0004166666666666959,0.0004166666666666959,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

50152,1,"Sluggish , Uneventful , Corny and Borrrrring I usually read Stephen King for his interesting ideas and imagery and expect his books to read fast and well . I 've read three previous King books that have had the occasional long passages with overstated depictions of horror , doom , and grotesquery in order to immerse his readers into the tone of his story . This one takes the cake because what is meant to read as terror and horror is really ridiculous and unimaginative . And this is exactly what "" Insomnia "" is . This is n't a spoiler , just the author 's note : at the end of the book we read Sep. 10 , 1990- Nov 10 , 1993- three years in which King took to write this book . Three years which were evidently wasted . The other King books I 've read were engrossing for their characterizations and character identification . "" Insomnia 's "" Ralph Roberts is certainly a character the reader could identify with . He is strong , kind , has traditional gentlemanly views on aiding women in distress and regards them as beautiful and respectable . His counterpart Lois Chasse does n't come across as identifiable . Instead she serves as a secondary character who has no real flair or identity other than being in love with Ralph . King does n't usually do that with his secondary characters . Other characters with much smaller roles in this book come across as real and identifiable , like Ed and Helen Deepenau , the three bald doctors , and Ralph 's numerous confidantes . Then there 's the whole abortion mess . This central political issue crumbles midway thru and seems to serve no purpose at all in the story . Though King does provide an interesting and seemingly objective commentary on the issue via Detective Leydecker ( albeit with a tranparently pro - choice slant ) , it serves no relevance to the theme of the story but just hangs there on display used for no more than a story device . I gave the book two stars because I am an inspiring writer and reading this provided me with some of the devices that are important to utilize as part of a writer 's arsenal . The devices were obvious and all thru the reading I asked myself , ' How is King going to get through this ? ' His weapon of choice was most often Ralph Robert 's narration ( via third person ) that analyzed the events of the story and interpreted its meaning and significance . It seemed whenever King was in trouble in the story , he would use Ralph as his solution and let him think it out and guide it for him . This is a useful tool for a beginning writer , but King used it as a crutch to tell a story that had no pulse from the beginning . One last thing , the villians just do n't work . They are not frightening , they are not demonic , they are not vicious or malign . Three little bald doctors with scalpels and scissors ? Their defining characteristics are being small and bald- does that really frighten anyone ? The real villian among them dances around and jump ropes to reveal his evil madness . Then there 's the Crimson King , the evil supernatural mastermind we read about from page 100 who finally enters the story on page 550 as a Catfish in one of the most terrible , anti - climactic scenes ever rendered . I rest my case .",615,0,0.00018867924528304087,0.00018867924528304087,0.00018867924528304087,0.02256180645501128,0.00018867924528304087,0.007457659787966659,0.00018867924528304087,0.05459199834125233,0.00018867924528304087,0.00018867924528304087,0.00018867924528304087,0.00018867924528304087,0.12463679189739496,0.00018867924528304087,0.00018867924528304087,0.00018867924528304087,0.00018867924528304087,0.00018867924528304087,0.00018867924528304087,0.00018867924528304087,0.00018867924528304087,0.00018867924528304087,0.00018867924528304087,0.00018867924528304087,0.011012792266802676,0.00018867924528304087,0.00018867924528304087,0.00018867924528304087,0.00018867924528304087,0.00018867924528304087,0.00018867924528304087,0.00018867924528304087,0.00018867924528304087,0.00018867924528304087,0.12582198916881596,0.00018867924528304087,0.43356892915207645,0.00018867924528304087,0.00018867924528304087,0.00018867924528304087,0.052991175220524336,0.00018867924528304087,0.009629719381571523,0.07377916648939274,0.00018867924528304087,0.03481350539009112,0.04196465512834452,0.00018867924528304087,0.00018867924528304087,0.00018867924528304087,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0

It looks really good on the surface and does have a lot of useful information . One problem I found is that many of the example photos seem to be inserted only to increase the photo count . Also , because of printing limitations , I find it very difficult to see the differences between before and after examples . I have edited this review to fix an error . However , I can not figure out how to change my rating from 2 stars to 4 stars .

50155,1,"Agree with "" Lost in Translation "" I have loved each and every one of Jane Hamilton 's other novels and highly recommend them : The Book of Ruth , A Map of the World , Short History of a Prince and Disobedience . This book , sadly , does not rank among them . It feels forced and uninteresting , with outlandish and unrecognizable characters and scenarios . I 've already paid for it , so I 'll probably try to finish it , but do n't waste your time or money .

50156,1,This is a great book ... This is a great book if you have the right teacher . The book is very informative yet if you have no back ground in abnormal psych you might want to make sure the teacher for your course is capable of explaining it to you . I also recomend that you make sure your copy has a CD rom . The study guide and website are great tools too .

50247,1,"Not quite what I expected ... The first twenty pages of the book quickly sparks your interest but soon after that , the story drags until it picks back up again toward the last third of the book . I think the story would have been more credible if Barr would have thoroughly explored the inner workings of her fictional religious sect and offered more details about it . Without those details , the book seemed "" unfinished "" . It was like watching a movie and only viewing the actions of the good guy without being exposed to villain .

If you want to get an "" inside view "" of the inner workings of Wall Street during the excessive gyrations of the ' 80s , then read Den of Theives - that book is well written and well worth the money!What turned me off about this book was the structure and the writing style . The first half of the book was essentially the author relating fortuitous circumstances that were the product of Serendipity . He was simply in the right place at the right time , had virutally no idea how he got there , felt out of place the whole time ( even when he was raking in the Big Bucks in NY and London ) , and so now he thought he 'd wwrite a book about it . I also got the sense that he was trying to assuage some guilt from his association at Salomon Brothers . He was there , he made a lot of money , good for him - get over it!I was also pretty disappointed because the subject matter has A LOT more potential . I might have actually enjoyed it - had I not read Den of Theives 7 years earlier , and already had some idea of how things took place . But , if you can get it for $ 5 or less ( including shipping ) , and you have little to no knowledge of what an investment banker 's life is like ( and you have n't also seen the movie Wall Street ( which covers the same highlights in this book ) ) , then it 's probably worth it .

Many people that have heard of these games or seen their children watch the TV - spinoffs , most likely would not be able to identify what the games actually look(ed ) like or anything about their play dynamics in a gaming environment . Even though Mario , Zelda , Pokemon , Donkey Kong , Defender , Asteroids , Missile Command , Frogger , etc . are mentioned briefly there are no images of reference for these classic games for us to ( a ) review and recognize , and ( b ) learn from . If this is supposed to be a sort of retrospective of the graphic art of game design ( this is not about studies of techniques for rendering ) then why not show some of these all - time classics as well as the ' new - time ' classics ? The latter are better represented throughout the book but some of the choices are omissions are questionable . The brief smattering of ' classics ' that are shown tend to be more human - looking figurative than ' iconic ' which seems lacking to me in breadth and style of representation . Beyond this much of the work - but not all - feels and looks rather ' same - y ' to me . Lots of brooding dark scene - scapes and characters clearly inspired by countless horror / goth / fantasy masters such as Boris Vallejo or much of the work seen in Heavy Metal . When there is mention of games that are actually considered modern art on display at world - famous museums , such as "" Rez , "" -- we are not shown any images of it because space was taken up by two nearly identical renderings of Lara Croft ( ! ) in the same spread . One has to ask oneself : what was the author / picture editor thinking?The fact of the matter is that for all the long - winded talk in the intro there is little to graphically show us where the industry came from verses where we are now . And from what I can tell , there is absolutely no mention of the explosion of games and utterly unique designs being done in FLASH . Arguably one of the largest and least expensive / complicated environments for making a unique game . Furthermore , all the games covered and talked about ( that I can tell ) are from very large corporations and as such tend to be slanted and biased in a number of regards . My biggest problem with this book was the editing - particularly with regard to choices of art . Far too many examples if things that look the same versus examples of unique design concepts and forms as well as proper representations for an historical analysis . Very nice printing , some nice layouts , and some interesting topics are raised with relation to character conception versus form , versus environment - but I would not recommend this for critical graphic design analysis or critical anything",590,0,0.24138754052212064,0.0767319104900889,0.00024691358024694487,0.00024691358024694487,0.027555976569090947,0.00024691358024694487,0.00024691358024694487,0.00024691358024694487,0.08861168003850263,0.00024691358024694487,0.00024691358024694487,0.00024691358024694487,0.00024691358024694487,0.00024691358024694487,0.00024691358024694487,0.00024691358024694487,0.00024691358024694487,0.00024691358024694487,0.00024691358024694487,0.00024691358024694487,0.00024691358024694487,0.00024691358024694487,0.00024691358024694487,0.01720753042427078,0.00024691358024694487,0.00024691358024694487,0.00024691358024694487,0.00024691358024694487,0.00024691358024694487,0.00024691358024694487,0.00024691358024694487,0.012456424146223203,0.04364861389237294,0.00024691358024694487,0.018257003406974705,0.00024691358024694487,0.11587405602487877,0.00024691358024694487,0.00024691358024694487,0.00024691358024694487,0.00024691358024694487,0.00024691358024694487,0.00024691358024694487,0.25009144486937845,0.012108527273286528,0.057526302648169686,0.029407187225504974,0.00024691358024694487,0.00024691358024694487,0.00024691358024694487,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0

I just could n't get into the plot . I even found the story somewhat disturbing and eerie , especially for young children to read . There are very evil characters in this book who would be much better suited for an adult sci - fi novel , rather than a book marketed for children and young teens . The characters were unlikeable , and the plot just never seemed to grab my attention . I was very dissapointed that this is from the same author who wrote the amazing Bartimeus trilogy books !

An author who churns out 3 or 4 novels a year does n't have time to do the kind of research that is needed to produce a plausible terrorist thriller .

50338,1,"The Careless Characterization of Helping Professionals McKnight 's concerns about communities ' dependency on professional assistance are legitimate , but disturbingly overstated in this book . In the end I felt McKnight 's trashing of the already well - trodden government provision of social services may not be altogether helpful to distressed communities . He sidesteps concerns of capital mobility and exploitation and the pernicious effects wrought by years of discrimination . Any debate over when and where and how social programs can be effective is cast aside as well , since in McKnight 's picture , social programs and the professional service providers are , in fact , the vilains and culprits for most of what ails society . One of the damaging fallacies that seems to be perpetuated in this book is that service professionals are not able to be both professional and caring - the two are deemed mutually incompatible . Mcknights views resonate with employers ' caring rhetoric - conveniently invoked every time a healthcare worker tries to claim she does care about patients but is still entitled to a living wage or , perhaps , health insurance . What is further implied is that communities will readily and ably take up the reign of providing for themselves and their members when denied more institutionalized professional services . It seems implied that communities had no problems before the social programs to solve them came into being . In this , I think I see McKnight is invokeing an idealized notion of an society at an earlier time ; maybe his argument would have seemed more reasoble in a time when families were less geographically mobile and may have constituted an economic unit , when the elderly lived shorter lives and were less numerous themselves with more children to care for them , and the local economic activities were more functionally interdependent . But McKnight 's model for today 's cure does n't seem to fit today 's conditions . On the other hand , McKnights solutions may be the only ones available in a society where budget cuts and elimination of social services seem the prevailing trend .",362,0,0.0005882352941177,0.0005882352941177,0.0005882352941177,0.13390082531950054,0.0005882352941177,0.06190833558600173,0.029999999999999902,0.0005882352941177,0.0005882352941177,0.0005882352941177,0.0005882352941177,0.0005882352941177,0.2346299660106061,0.0005882352941177,0.0005882352941177,0.0005882352941177,0.054385977198878534,0.0005882352941177,0.0005882352941177,0.0005882352941177,0.0005882352941177,0.0005882352941177,0.030030557111763057,0.03387179907533721,0.0005882352941177,0.0005882352941177,0.0773658648084423,0.0005882352941177,0.0005882352941177,0.03761717688650632,0.0005882352941177,0.0005882352941177,0.0005882352941177,0.0005882352941177,0.06614659579233584,0.0005882352941177,0.10832402440680017,0.0005882352941177,0.0005882352941177,0.0005882352941177,0.10946593662735561,0.0005882352941177,0.0005882352941177,0.0005882352941177,0.0005882352941177,0.0005882352941177,0.0005882352941177,0.0005882352941177,0.0005882352941177,0.0005882352941177,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

50374,1,"Ego Visible I had high hopes when I picked up this book because Styron is a terrific writer and I was interested in the subject . By the time I was done I nearly threw it across the room . Admittedly , Depression makes for a tough topic , but that 's not good enough . There 's more to Depression than staring at an empty page , unable to muster the courage to write one single word . The dark places of the soul also have their fires , their drama , even if they are played out in secret . I will grant that the writing is spare and elegant , as you would expect . But I would have traded all the insider literati name - dropping for one paragraph that gave me a visceral sense of how he felt , something that put me there with him . I have read instruction manuals for appliances with more passion and conviction . Styron is candid about his descent into alcoholism , but the self - destruction inherent in alcoholism does not imply the elimination of ego , frequently it heralds the triumph of ego . In Darkness Visible , Styron maintains egomaniacal control of his subject through aloof detachment , showcasing a carefully polished veneer , never inviting the reader in .",225,0,0.0008333333333334271,0.12137412432641526,0.0008333333333334271,0.0008333333333334271,0.0008333333333334271,0.0008333333333334271,0.0008333333333334271,0.09767099896046663,0.09509543183160739,0.0008333333333334271,0.0008333333333334271,0.0008333333333334271,0.0008333333333334271,0.0008333333333334271,0.0008333333333334271,0.0008333333333334271,0.0008333333333334271,0.0008333333333334271,0.0008333333333334271,0.0008333333333334271,0.0008333333333334271,0.0008333333333334271,0.0008333333333334271,0.0008333333333334271,0.0008333333333334271,0.0008333333333334271,0.0008333333333334271,0.0008333333333334271,0.03482399798759799,0.0008333333333334271,0.0008333333333334271,0.0008333333333334271,0.0008333333333334271,0.0008333333333334271,0.0008333333333334271,0.0008333333333334271,0.579310128672713,0.0008333333333334271,0.0008333333333334271,0.0008333333333334271,0.0008333333333334271,0.035058651554529016,0.0008333333333334271,0.0008333333333334271,0.0008333333333334271,0.0008333333333334271,0.0008333333333334271,0.0008333333333334271,0.0008333333333334271,0.0008333333333334271,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
50375,1,"Horrible , horrible book . As someone very interested in urban exploration ( especially in the subways ) I wanted to check this book out upon hearing of it . After reading many of these Amazon reviews though , I opted out of a purchase , and took it out of my Bronx library instead . Thank goodness as I only wasted valuable time , and not any money . This book is a sham . It is obviously mostly fiction . And it 's boring fiction at that . The book is divided into chapters , each chapter a new "" adventure . "" I read the subway one first , where the "" explorers "" take the 6 train around the loop at the end of the line , to see the City Hall Station , which opened in 1904 ( NYC 's first station ) and closed in 1948 . The station is located on the loop of the 6 train , that makes the southbound trains go back up north after the last stop , Brooklyn Bridge . First of all , anyone can go on this "" adventure . "" Just stay on the train at the last stop , Brooklyn Bridge , and that 's it . Despite the author 's attempt to make this sound risky , no conductors walk through the train to see if anyone is on ( like they really care ) , just sit down . The author created some "" European tourists "" that inadvertantly stayed on the 6 after the last stop , and the author even tries to create some mystery by saying "" are we on the wrong train ? "" Well , unless all those huge "" 6 "" signs that are lit all over the train are difficult to read , then you probably got on the correct train . The author also fails to mention that the MTA used to give public tours all the time through this station ( and others like the 18th street on the 6 and more ) but stopped after 9 - 11 . This chapter was a joke . I started reading the other chapters , and saw they were no better . I then started to breeze through the book . One thing that is very obvious - no photographs of the adventures are in the book at all . This , despite the fact that on page 67 the author states , "" Josh takes out his camera and snaps away at every pipe and puddle ... "" But no photos of their "" adventures "" are in the book . Why ? Because it 's fiction . There are photos of what they are supposed to be exploring , sure , that 's easy . There 's even one pic of one of these clowns hopping some fence somewhere , ooo . Buit no pics of the actual "" adventures . "" I guess "" Josh "" lost all those pictures when he went to CVS to have them developed . The funny thing is , you can save yourself a lot of time by just going online and viewing pictures of these things for yourself . Especially the City Hall station , there are tons of pictures of it available from the people that were in there during the tours . Just stay away from this sham of a book , it 's really a huge waste of time",587,0,0.00021739130434785044,0.11625725772342219,0.00021739130434785044,0.00021739130434785044,0.00021739130434785044,0.014521234327396394,0.00021739130434785044,0.00021739130434785044,0.00021739130434785044,0.00021739130434785044,0.014842486059096409,0.033157756122867546,0.2907852870946461,0.00021739130434785044,0.00021739130434785044,0.00021739130434785044,0.00021739130434785044,0.00021739130434785044,0.00021739130434785044,0.00021739130434785044,0.00021739130434785044,0.00021739130434785044,0.00021739130434785044,0.00021739130434785044,0.00021739130434785044,0.00021739130434785044,0.00021739130434785044,0.00021739130434785044,0.014122279622600596,0.01244064654779107,0.00021739130434785044,0.00021739130434785044,0.00021739130434785044,0.00021739130434785044,0.00021739130434785044,0.00021739130434785044,0.30694042608831534,0.00021739130434785044,0.00021739130434785044,0.057496892367778205,0.032593683477651424,0.00021739130434785044,0.00021739130434785044,0.00021739130434785044,0.09836378969886868,0.00021739130434785044,0.00021739130434785044,0.00021739130434785044,0.00021739130434785044,0.00021739130434785044,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

50395,1,"Did n't like the writing style at all I have never read one of Johansen 's books and after reading this one , I 'm not likely to read another . I usually enjoy reading pretty much any type of mystery and am not a literary critic by any means , but I just could n't get into the story here because of the flowery and cliche - filled writing . Exclamations such as "" dear heaven "" and "" lord "" were repeated over and over again by all characters throughout the book , which does n't seem to fit with the rest of their conversational tone ( it would suit my southern grandma , however ) . As another reviewer said , the big mystery of why Daisy would n't leave Geneva was n't particularly mysterious - if she really wanted Jason to leave she could have just told him .

50398,1,Genetics : From Genes to Genomes I found this book extremely verbose and unorganized . It would serve as a great reference book for a lab researcher or grad student . But it 's way too technical and dense for an introductory genetics class . The authors do a poor job presenting the material in a comprehensible way to an undergraduate genetics student .

50406,1,"Reinharts disappointing hyped coffeetable bread book . As a professional , certified chef and baker , I am also an avid baking and cookbook collector . After seeing that this book won and the James Beard and the ' IACP Cookbook of the Year ' awards -both prominently displayed on the cover of this book- and after reading the ' too good to be true'-reviews on Amazon -some reviewers sound so exalted and in trance as if Peter Reinhart is the Jesus Christ of Bread- I finally decided to buy this expensive book . What a dissappointment ! For all those blindly following Reinhart as he were the Saviour of True Bread , wake up ! Reinhart 's book is simply flawed . Compared to other bread books , it 's even a quite average book . But one that is luxuriously packaged . A lot of hot colorful expensive air . And it 's expensive not because of the info and exlusive bread knowledge in it , but because of the super luxuriously editing . This is a book for book enthousiasts , not for bakers , professional or home . I see baking and cookbooks mainly as working tools , as information and inspiration . Not as eye candy . If you want nice pictures , buy an art book . A book on baking bread with these awards behind it , should give you tons of new info about ingredients and techniques , original insights , an appetite for baking , factual info , the newest and tested developments in technique ... What you get here is a fluffed up egotrip . 47 formulas and ample bread info packaged into a shining 30 - 40 $ publishing hype . Don't get me wrong : this is a beautiful , expensive book . But one you do n't use in the kitchen , and certainly do n't smudge with butter but put on the coffee table in the living room to impress guests and have polite conversations about . But as a source of new information or enlightening up to date bread knowledge , giving pointers about using new bread ingredients combined with old proven bread baking techniques , as a working tool sweating near the hot oven at home or at a bakery , compared to other bread books , this book fails miserably info - wise . But it has a snappy lay out . Jeff Hamelmans ' Bread , a Book of Techniques ' and Rose Beranbaums ' Bread Bible ' give the readers much more practical info and insight into bread baking . They talk more about the subject ' bread ' . And not about themselves like Peter Reinhart clearly relishes . Mr Reinhart clearly sees himself as so important and interesting a person that we read in this book about his wife and their sightseeing in Paris . How about the bread info , the kneading , rising , baking , ingredient- and techniques info ? I honestly prefer industrious bakers who pass on their baking knowledge clearly without having to read at which hotel room they stayedin . Bakers with such big ego 's that think that readers of a Bread Baking book are more interested in the shopping experiences of the wife during ' a learning trip ' to professional bakers on which she accompanied him , than in another bread formula 's , should work in shobizz , not in a bakery or a culinary school . Big ego 's with more talk than substance galore in the food industry . Reinart is , judging by this book , sadly also one of them . I do n't see in a 1000 years Rose Beranbaum in one of her books rambling on about her husbands prefered color of ties or Jeff Hamelman writing in a bread book about the time he spent with his wife in Paris . Mr . Reinhart : your readers forked out 30 - 40 $ for bread info , not your personal travel experiences . As you as a teachers no doubts sometimes say to a pupil : Stay with the subject ! And the subject of this book , for which I paid is ' Bread and Baking . If we want to know about your personal life , we 'll read an interview in People , if they find you interesting enough . Peter Reinharts ' The Bread Baker 's Apprentice ' as a ' Bread Book ' is simply a marketing creation . Smartly edited , but way too short on substance . There is not much new information on bread . Worse : there is not much info at all ! In total for 30 - 40 $ , you get exactly 47 formulas on 307 pages of which 2 color photo pages are simply ads for other books by Ten Speed Press , the editor or this book . Compared to Beranbaums 640 pages , Hamelmans 400 plus pages , that is a big difference for a big price . With Reinharts book , you get a lot of shining white surface that in other Bread books is filled with bread info . As a buyer of this book , you also pay for full page black - and - white and color pictures that are pure filler . See p. 3 , 6 , 26 ... And why is the beautiful model Fumie on the cover of a bread book and not mr . Reinhart himself or even ... bread alone ? With Reinharts next book they will no doubt put Kate Moss in an apron and a bakers vest . Package the air attractive enough and the readers will swallow it and fork out the 30 - 40$. Never mind the content . Let 's talk a bit about the formula 's . That should be an important part of a baking book , right ? And they should be original and fine tuned , right ? Sadly to say : nothing new or original here . Some are n't even fine tuned . And baking is all about fine tuning . Worse , almost all the formula 's can be found in other bread books . And , most insulting for a buyer of this book , a lot of the mere 47 formulas ( Reinhart uses this expensive word because ' recipe ' propably does n't fit into the marketing of this baking book ) in this book are rehashed or directly derived from Reinharts former book ' Crust and Crumb ' . Clever marketing and ba - da - bing ! By the way , ' Crust and Crumb ' has been reedited in 2006 . At a fair price , I admit . So if you want your dose of Reinhart at a right price without the pomp , sc � nes of a marriage , without Peter Reinharts comment on the Eiffel tower so to speak ... buy ' Crust and Crumb ' and leave this luxuriously edited egotrip on the shelves . But before I buy I would also first flip through Beranbaums and Hamelmans bread books in the bookshop or in the Amazon shop . As for this book , you should ask yourself : ' Do I want a serious bread book or a nice coffeetable book ? ' . Taking in consideration all the egostroking in this book and in reviews , as a baking book for the world market , this book is almost worthless . The universal accepted working standard in worldwide baking is metric weight . Like it or not , but that 's a fact . You weigh your ingredients carefully by grams , kilo 's etc . Reinhart visited French top bakers Poilane and Gosselin , clearly admires them and aspires to reach their level of baking . I do n't think that Poilane measures in cups and ounces ! But even then , let Reinhart measure in cups for the home market . But then have the decency to add the metric equivalent in the formula 's itself for the rest of the world . This guy goes on and on about his wish to bake authentic European inspired bread like ciabatta , fougasse ... About a Worldwide Bread Revolution ! And then he refuses to use the most important tool to make these breads : the same language , the metric weight system . Rose Beranbaum places the metric equivalent next to the cups / ounces . It 's a simple as that . Bread is a world food , so use the world standard for baking . If not , market your book mainly to the USA market and be honest and upfront about that . And do n't give us that inflated hot air babble about a Worldwide Bread Revolution without using the worldwide accepted working standard , the metric wieght system ! This big flaw makes the book almost useless for bakers outside the USA . The Worldwide Bread Revolution wo n't be for tommorrow if we have to use this book worldwide!Next point : Reinhart advocates instant yeast over fresh pressed yeast . Every baker worth his salt ( or yeast ) will tell you that fresh yeast gives a far better taste , volume and texture . Yeast is a living organism . As ' instant yeast ' it has been dried and put on the shelves for God knows how long . It 's like you force a just woken up coma - patient , that has been dormant for months , years ... to run a marathon . Fresh , pressed yeast is still alive and its taste and texture are a world of difference compared to ' instant ' ( aka dried ) yeast . Try the difference between fresh yeast and instant yeast for taste and texture and fully developed rising at home , and judge for yourself . To place fresh yeast on the same level as instant yeast is preposterous for someone like Reinhart who spends days on his pre ferments ! For scientific back up , you can always read the recently translated book of world renowed food scientist Herve This ' Molecular Gastronomy , Exploring the Science of Flavor ' ( Columbia University Press 2006).And it gets worse . Reinhart frequently uses shortening instead of butter or olive oil in his breads . If Poilane hears this , he 'll drop dead ! Every baker knows that even a small amount of butter gives a much better taste and texture than shortening . Shortening produces a rancid / metallic taste and a slimy , unpleasant mouthfeel . Not to talk about health . Most shortening is choc full of trans fats which are much more unhealty than butter fat . Read Harvard 's nutrition professor Walter Willets book : ' Eat , Drink and be Healthy ' ( Free Press 2001 ) . New York has already picked this info up . Professional food writer and teacher Reinhart has n't or does n't care . For instance , Reinhart proudly declares -not as a joke- that in Italian bread you can use shortening instead of olive oil . In Italian Bread ! Come on , let 's be serious . And this guy teaches at the Culinary Institute of America ! It 's like he is advocating spam to put on the BBQ instead of beef ! If that is the standard of baking that Reinhart uses , he 'll have to wait a long time to reach the standards of a Poilane . Then there is Reinharts Hygi � ne Problem . There is an international standard for basic hygiene in food called the Hazzard Analysis of Critical Control Points ( HACCP ) . Reinhart as a professional tutor and teacher must no doubt know the HACCP by heart . The first thing in hygiene that an apprentice baker learns , is that before even touching ingredients , he must remove all the rings on his fingers . Because the place underneath a wedding band for instance , is the place where the filth gathers and bacteria feast . And kneading dough with all that filth underneath a wedding band that you keep on , is not only very dangerous for the health of customers , it is simply not done for a baker . I like my bread without filth baked in , thank you very much ! In the school where I earned my diplome in baking , if a student had a ring on during practical class , he had to leave the class immediately and he lost important points for his exam . Yet we see professional teacher and Bread Book Author Reinhart kneading dough WITH HIS WEDDING BAND ON ! See p. 36 - 37 , 82 - 83 , 255 , 245 ... Unforgivable in a ' professional ' baking book . And all the more in an expensive book that won the James Beard and IACP awards ! Has anyone of the juries of the James Beard Foundation and the IACP , any basic knowledge of food hygiene ? Has nobody seen this cardinal sin against food hygi � ne in a so called ' professional Bread Book ' ? One other thing , for a bread book that pretends to be world class , there is no word about gluten - free bread . Not one formula . And this while more and more people are allergic to gluten ( protein in wheat flour).To end on a positive note , one thing I found acceptable in this expensive coffee table book , was his 55 pages with the 12 stages of bread . But , fellow reviewers , you can find all this info and more , and explained more clearly , more detailed and to the point , in Hamelmans ' Bread ' and Beranbaums ' Bread Bible ' . And it does n't take 55 pages of expensive high quality shining white paper . Peter , take out all the white empty space , learn to write more clearly and to the point , and you can say the same thing in 20 pages . Which leaves you 35 pages for more formula 's for example . But if you have n't any formula 's left or are preparing a new book , then , yes , by all means stretch the 12 stages of bread to 55 scarcely printed pages instead of 20 . Why make it simple if you can make it seem difficult , impress your not so knowledgable readers and in doing so stroking your own ego?So despite all the hoopla , hyped reviews , near hysterical praise and important awards , this is simply a too expensive , show off - book . It 's like the tale of ' the King with no Clothes on ' . Somebody has to yell : ' Hey , wait a minute!'If you want good books on bread baking : buy one by Jeff Hamelman , Rose Beranbaum and Bernard Clayton . You do n't get a model on the cover , but the content is all the better . And in a bread book , is n't content more important than packaging",2578,0,0.16138306306134165,0.061899936000061676,0.005453690660774404,0.0075033188791414195,0.00374698603639697,5.602240896359195e-05,5.602240896359195e-05,0.02164557148915475,0.011414263013876309,5.602240896359195e-05,5.602240896359195e-05,5.602240896359195e-05,5.602240896359195e-05,5.602240896359195e-05,5.602240896359195e-05,5.602240896359195e-05,0.016955245557847734,0.0274924985920225,0.016849881118309266,0.004307580451642041,5.602240896359195e-05,5.602240896359195e-05,5.602240896359195e-05,0.007569837865105429,0.008947768694879132,0.008620628041339912,5.602240896359195e-05,5.602240896359195e-05,0.005332515396117936,0.0337785182530849,5.602240896359195e-05,0.009761332460722564,0.03304402654348799,5.602240896359195e-05,0.01743721453031888,0.014723537691197632,0.35567055608664494,0.005182835129586273,0.044746460450378674,0.005992351776662517,0.017298837929061235,5.602240896359195e-05,0.02563802024850985,5.602240896359195e-05,0.04471468403068468,5.602240896359195e-05,0.0216563470144497,5.602240896359195e-05,5.602240896359195e-05,5.602240896359195e-05,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0
50407,1,"History of the Dictionary "" This has been a story of an American soldier whose involvement in the making of the world 's greatest dictionary was singular , astonishing , memorable and laudable - and yet at the same time wretchedly sad . "" - Prologue . Well , that certainly could have been the story . But what it was was a history of the dictionary ( as in "" the history of the horse "" ) with W.C. Minor 's contributions finally gotten to on page 116 or so . Winchester , the author of several other books I 'll avoid , also seems to suffer from the common malady - or unwillingness - of not knowing how to end a book . So the last fifty pages sink the poor reader into ... the history of insanity / dimentia / Alzeihmer 's , whatever you want to call what Minor suffered . Whereas I should have shed a tear when the main character - assuming it was n't a dictionary - was laid to rest at age 85 , I was fairly glad to see him go .",191,0,0.0007407407407408036,0.0007407407407408036,0.03778410902295414,0.0007407407407408036,0.0007407407407408036,0.0007407407407408036,0.0007407407407408036,0.0007407407407408036,0.0007407407407408036,0.0007407407407408036,0.0007407407407408036,0.0007407407407408036,0.0007407407407408036,0.0007407407407408036,0.0007407407407408036,0.0007407407407408036,0.0007407407407408036,0.0007407407407408036,0.0007407407407408036,0.0007407407407408036,0.0007407407407408036,0.0007407407407408036,0.0007407407407408036,0.0007407407407408036,0.0007407407407408036,0.0007407407407408036,0.0007407407407408036,0.0007407407407408036,0.0007407407407408036,0.0007407407407408036,0.0007407407407408036,0.18535594488085033,0.0007407407407408036,0.0007407407407408036,0.08996637330113783,0.0007407407407408036,0.3742709326022938,0.0007407407407408036,0.0007407407407408036,0.0007407407407408036,0.0007407407407408036,0.0007407407407408036,0.0007407407407408036,0.2792893068594278,0.0007407407407408036,0.0007407407407408036,0.0007407407407408036,0.0007407407407408036,0.0007407407407408036,0.0007407407407408036,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
50408,1,"Good book but in the wrong way As a romantic comedy , Star Wars is a failure . As a science fiction film , the Annie Hall is a complete disappointment . Whatever other merits these movies might have , there are definitely areas that they are lacking . Which brings me to The Rough Guide to Cult Movies : as a reference book , it is highly suspect . What 's notable is that Annie Hall fails as sci - fi because it does n't try to be that genre ; The Rough Guide fails at the very category it aspires to . Which is too bad , because it is often an interesting read . The failure starts at the beginning of the book with a definition of cult movies that is so broad as to be meaningless . We then a series of chapters representing various "" genres "" , some of which are valid ( science fiction , westerns , horror ) , some of which are ridiculous ( Animals , Food , Nuns ) and some of which are not even true genres ( dubbed , independent , straight - to - video ) . After this , we get various miscellaneous topics that are thrown in without rhyme or reason , such as a list of top movie grosses followed by presidential movie trivia . The movie descriptions are often amusing , although there are numerous errors ( such as misstating Geoffrey Rush 's role in Pirates of the Caribbean ) , even more omissions ( every reader will find his own ; one example is that Unforgiven is missing from Westerns ) and plenty of movies that are really miscategorized but seem only placed in a specific genre to fill it out . What saves this book is , even though it fails as a reference book , it is nonetheless entertaining . I am therefore giving this two stars instead of one . It 's a rather useless book , especially if you want to learn more about movies , but if you do pick it up , it is probably the most entertaining two - star book that you 're ever likely to read .",374,0,0.028665581672407677,0.0003921568627451281,0.0003921568627451281,0.0003921568627451281,0.0003921568627451281,0.0003921568627451281,0.0003921568627451281,0.0003921568627451281,0.0003921568627451281,0.0003921568627451281,0.0003921568627451281,0.020198716960344955,0.0003921568627451281,0.0003921568627451281,0.0003921568627451281,0.0003921568627451281,0.0003921568627451281,0.0003921568627451281,0.0003921568627451281,0.0003921568627451281,0.4763758500356438,0.08988009488466878,0.0003921568627451281,0.021074504899234393,0.0003921568627451281,0.0003921568627451281,0.0003921568627451281,0.0003921568627451281,0.0003921568627451281,0.0003921568627451281,0.0003921568627451281,0.0003921568627451281,0.0003921568627451281,0.0003921568627451281,0.0003921568627451281,0.0003921568627451281,0.32024281224855,0.0003921568627451281,0.0003921568627451281,0.0003921568627451281,0.0003921568627451281,0.0003921568627451281,0.0003921568627451281,0.0003921568627451281,0.0003921568627451281,0.02669969420110976,0.0003921568627451281,0.0003921568627451281,0.0003921568627451281,0.0003921568627451281,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
50410,1,"your head will split open and ooze goop after reading this All I can say is pass me some aspirin . This is a dozy of a bad novel . As it says on the dust jacket , a Supreme Court law clerk grabs a petition and ends up becoming deceased . Its up to the brother to uncover the truth by finding the real killer who had let a poor black man rot away for a crime he did not commit . At the same time the brother contends with mysterious bad guys out to get him and stop the unearthing of the evidence . Not only does he deal with his family , but his brothers friend , a sexy young law clerk herself and the duplicity on the bench she works for . And that 's only the start of the plot . Its really pretty bad , it descends into mired pretensions and goofy resolutions . The characters are so shallow that you are left with little notion of who they are except for a faint nasty after taste over their conceded ways . Baldacci is along with James Patterson and Dean Koontz one of America 's worst authors . If you want an author who writes on a similar vein to this , try one of Harlan Coben 's last four or so stand alone thrillers with out the character Myron Bolitar in it . Or for a more sophisticated read , look for Denis Lehane , he wrote the amazing Mystic River , but his PI series located in Boston is pretty good as well .",272,0,0.21641744202214386,0.0322660525380126,0.023155875589363578,0.04199246835465048,0.048335584530758056,0.0004347826086956921,0.02267229785415328,0.05620157518072458,0.0004347826086956921,0.0004347826086956921,0.0004347826086956921,0.0004347826086956921,0.0004347826086956921,0.0004347826086956921,0.0004347826086956921,0.0004347826086956921,0.17148810105542495,0.0004347826086956921,0.0004347826086956921,0.0004347826086956921,0.0004347826086956921,0.10050006888215222,0.0004347826086956921,0.024683183548181536,0.0004347826086956921,0.0004347826086956921,0.0004347826086956921,0.0004347826086956921,0.0004347826086956921,0.0004347826086956921,0.0004347826086956921,0.0004347826086956921,0.0004347826086956921,0.0004347826086956921,0.06602688933571871,0.030121230243404278,0.15005227434357116,0.0004347826086956921,0.0004347826086956921,0.0004347826086956921,0.0004347826086956921,0.0004347826086956921,0.0004347826086956921,0.0004347826086956921,0.0004347826086956921,0.0004347826086956921,0.0004347826086956921,0.0004347826086956921,0.0004347826086956921,0.0004347826086956921,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

50437,1,"Dry , boring and unrewarding Paul Auster 's City of Glass is perhaps the worst read I 've experienced . The story moves at a pace that would make a snail envious ; the murder mystery plot is as thin as air and hardly resolves itself ; we spend way too many waking hours with the main character sulking around his apartment staring into a toilet bowl in which he has just defficated -- I kid you not . The best part of this novel is the end . I read with fervor to get to the end in hopes that the author would have the talent to tie everything together and make this experience somewhat valid ; however , I was utterly and discustingly dissapointed beyond my wildest dreams . To all the reviewers and critics who claim this book is a metaphysical , existential tour de - force , I beg wholeheartedly with my very life to differ . I believe the author had no such thoughts in mind , had no direction when writing this disgrace of a work and it saddens me to see such an unentertaining , dry - dry - dry piece of fiction with one or two not - so - clever plot devices , gather such literary praise . Like a Rorschach image you can see life , love , death , a myriad of wonderful symbols , and if you would like to believe that the person who put that ink blot on the page intended you to see all of that depth , intepret and dwell in that depth -- coming to conclusions and reflecting ultimately on your own life , well , then , good for you . But in reality , the person that made that Rorschach for you is Auster , and he just ambigoulsy splatted some ink on the novel pages before you with no ryhme or reason and you All bought it ... hook line and sinker . This novel is an exercise in an authors ability to take us nowhere , show us little on the way and still receive praise , despite an ending which is refelctive of the entire work , in that it plain and simply : sucks",377,0,0.00035087719298247926,0.00035087719298247926,0.00035087719298247926,0.06975591324064773,0.00035087719298247926,0.00035087719298247926,0.00035087719298247926,0.11495971480420554,0.00035087719298247926,0.00035087719298247926,0.00035087719298247926,0.01789473684210462,0.09169890675256263,0.00035087719298247926,0.016469724040140656,0.00035087719298247926,0.00035087719298247926,0.00035087719298247926,0.00035087719298247926,0.00035087719298247926,0.00035087719298247926,0.00035087719298247926,0.00035087719298247926,0.00035087719298247926,0.00035087719298247926,0.026842867950604275,0.00035087719298247926,0.00035087719298247926,0.00035087719298247926,0.00035087719298247926,0.00035087719298247926,0.00035087719298247926,0.00035087719298247926,0.00035087719298247926,0.00035087719298247926,0.00035087719298247926,0.6472904170714879,0.00035087719298247926,0.00035087719298247926,0.00035087719298247926,0.00035087719298247926,0.00035087719298247926,0.00035087719298247926,0.00035087719298247926,0.00035087719298247926,0.00035087719298247926,0.00035087719298247926,0.00035087719298247926,0.00035087719298247926,0.00035087719298247926,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

50443,1,"Not quite what it seems Nansook Hong paints a painful picture of her marriage to HyoJin Moon , but she does not own up to the full truth of her parents ' machinations to get her married into the Moon family . Eyewitnesses tell of Nansook visiting the Moon household and knowing full well of HyoJin 's excesses in advance of her marriage . The Hongs wanted desperately for their family to be entwined with the Moon family , and after arranging for one child to be we d to the first Moon daughter , they pushed Nansook to marry a Moon son . Though I do n't know all the motives , the point is that there was an agenda behind her marriage and probably this book that Ms. Hong has not been honest about . It is only too easy to paint an unflattering portrait of Rev Moon and his wife but at least some of this is suspect , given her own deceit",166,0,0.001000000000000069,0.001000000000000069,0.001000000000000069,0.001000000000000069,0.001000000000000069,0.001000000000000069,0.001000000000000069,0.14270108915101562,0.001000000000000069,0.001000000000000069,0.001000000000000069,0.001000000000000069,0.001000000000000069,0.001000000000000069,0.001000000000000069,0.001000000000000069,0.001000000000000069,0.001000000000000069,0.001000000000000069,0.001000000000000069,0.001000000000000069,0.001000000000000069,0.001000000000000069,0.001000000000000069,0.001000000000000069,0.001000000000000069,0.001000000000000069,0.001000000000000069,0.001000000000000069,0.052104361073372636,0.001000000000000069,0.001000000000000069,0.001000000000000069,0.001000000000000069,0.001000000000000069,0.001000000000000069,0.06944965018406703,0.001000000000000069,0.08839053904032107,0.001000000000000069,0.001000000000000069,0.15080227026302295,0.001000000000000069,0.001000000000000069,0.1854813869703688,0.268070703317829,0.001000000000000069,0.001000000000000069,0.001000000000000069,0.001000000000000069,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,1

Dramatically improve your resistance to disease , including cancers6 . Have more youthful , radiant skinYou do n't need to be a cynic to be able to tell that the claims are all inflated . Sure , you 'll see some improvement if you have been leading a very unhealthy lifestyle , but for those of us who are already exercising regularly and eating a relatively healthy diet , some of the tips on progressing further to "" genetic repair "" will sound a bit too good to be true .

50481,1,"How .... ? How some people gave this book a five star review is way beyond me . First of all , I 'd just like to mention that this nice book gives you schematic diagrams using symbols and other things without explaining them first ! Secondly , if you want to understand electronics it can only be assumed that you want to understand the physics behind it ! This book dedicates about a sentence to a paragraph to physics for each section . Horrible ! So basically , this INTRODUCTION to electronics does n't do a lot of introducing you to anything ! I 'm on transistors right now , and I 've spent days researching the physics of how they work on the Internet , and guess what ? It 's using schematics I do n't understand , and yet again I 'm going to have to do more looking on the net . This book is not worth it . Do n't buy it ! Just please , for your own sake , find another one . Also , half the book is dedicated to projects . That is , actually building electronic circuits ! Why did n't the author just entitle this , "" How to build electronic devices "" , then ? It 's beyond me ! As far as explaining things are concerned , the book does very little , and assume you know more than you do . Unfortunately I 'm going to have to end up buying another electronics textbook , because this one is just horrible . I was really wanting to learn something from this book , but it 's just not happening . For every chapter I 've read on this book I 've had to do research on the net , and I 'm sick of it . I 'm on pg . 154 , and I 'm closing it . DO NOT buy this book ! I 've already found a better book on amazon.com ( just buy reading the Table of Contents ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ) and I 'm going to get it !",365,0,0.0002816901408450926,0.03291458640158278,0.0002816901408450926,0.0002816901408450926,0.0002816901408450926,0.0002816901408450926,0.0002816901408450926,0.0002816901408450926,0.0002816901408450926,0.0002816901408450926,0.0002816901408450926,0.0002816901408450926,0.24843707022060715,0.0002816901408450926,0.03360177455699931,0.0002816901408450926,0.0002816901408450926,0.08181960174362125,0.0002816901408450926,0.0002816901408450926,0.0002816901408450926,0.0002816901408450926,0.0002816901408450926,0.0002816901408450926,0.0002816901408450926,0.0002816901408450926,0.013508026132326087,0.0002816901408450926,0.0002816901408450926,0.0002816901408450926,0.0002816901408450926,0.0002816901408450926,0.0364886608054102,0.0002816901408450926,0.0002816901408450926,0.0002816901408450926,0.32092103479357936,0.0002816901408450926,0.0002816901408450926,0.0002816901408450926,0.0002816901408450926,0.0002816901408450926,0.0002816901408450926,0.0002816901408450926,0.19208846607263855,0.0002816901408450926,0.028671483498586555,0.0002816901408450926,0.0002816901408450926,0.0002816901408450926,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0

50505,1,"Good Start - No Finish The author had all the elements for a good mystery / suspense except for one thing , the lack of an end or resolution to the mystery . I find it difficult to believe the author of such noted works as Bag of Bones and The Stand would leave his readers hanging in such a manner . Fiction should be about conflict and resolution and we have the basis for the conflict . A body turns up on the beach and the only clue comes from a pack of cigarettes found on the body .

50515,1,"It 's exciting , it will sell , but it 's just not happening # 65279;Millennials Rising is the latest book in the generational series by the authors William Strauss and Neil Howe , focusing this time on the generation born after X.For those not already familiar with the authors ' theory , Strauss and Howe are two authors who began writing about generations in 1991 . They wrote the book Generations , which introduced a theory that generations fall into four re - cycling types , and each type comes of age during a different kind of era , or "" turning "" . The Silent Generation is of the "" adaptive "" type , for instance , passive , gentle , and in tune with their emotions , and came of age during the Golden Age of postwar America . The Baby Boomers , remembered for their "" Awakening "" in the 1960s , are of the "" idealist "" type , concerned with God and spirituality and impassioned about what they believe in , but inclined to change during life ( from hippie to the current "" Just say no "" control freak ) . Generation X , which they named the Thirteenth Generation , is of the "" reactive "" type , being alienated , street - smart and materialistic , without a feeling of need to be "" loyal "" to anything , coming of age during the 1980s and 1990s . They then first identified everyone born since 1982 as the "" Millennial Generation "" , and predicted back in 1991 that it would be grow up to be optimistic , hard - working and clean - cut , just like the G.I. Generation that fought World War II , going back to the "" civic "" type generation before the Silent Generation . In 1993 they published the book Thirteenth Gen , which specialized in Generation X and why they are the way they are . In their third book , The Fourth Turning , they went back to the whole theory and writing about all the generations . They also changed the archetype names from adaptive , idealist , reactive and civic to Artist , Prophet , Nomad and Hero . Strauss and Howe wrote in this book about an upcoming era of epic battle and mass destruction , much like the one in which the G.I. Generation came of age . They then predicted the Millennial Generation would form the role of Heroes during the coming crisis , and they would lower teen pregnancy rates , stop using drugs , serve the United States , in uniform even , and desist with using profanity . So then in 2000 they put out this book , Millennials Rising . In this one the authors try to explain the Millennial Generation ( my generation ) . Millennials Rising attempts to identify who we , the most ethnically diverse generation in American history as they note , are . In Millennials Rising they write about this generation 's Boomer parents and their influence on the Millennial Generation , as well as the kind of world in which this generation is growing up ( which S H think of as hundreds of television channels , SUV lifestyles , rappers who swear , and people who smack each other on TV ) . The book states that Millennials want to work together in teams , believe the people in authority know more about right and wrong than they do , are enthusiastic about learning and going to school , are loved and protected by their parents , achieve great things in school and will achieve great things in the future , and lest we forget , always want to exude that "" positive peer pressure "" on their fellow Millennials . The obviously leads to the question , then , is the generation really optimistic , hard - working and clean - cut just as they say ? Consider this : Only 28 % of high school seniors say that the work they get assigned at school is "" meaningful "" , only 21 % describe their courses as "" interesting "" and still barely over a third , 39 % , believe that what they do in school will have any relation to their success later in life . The generation was supposed to be enthusiastic about learning . The Millennial Generation also rapidly increased drug use , especially pot , from the level at which Generation X was using them in its teens , as even the authors themselves note . S H portray the world of edgy entertainment , such as television shows , movies and music , as a Zoroastrian battle . In popular music , for instance , artists are described by extremes that either represent the alleged Millennial values or go actively against them -- on one side , artists like Eminem , Limp Bizkit and Marilyn Manson , on the other , boy bands and Britney Spears and her imitators , along with such second - tier bands as the S Club 7 . They do not deal with the Millennial interest in bands that lie somewhere in between the two . For instance , Blink-182 is just about the biggest band around now , and yet Millennials Rising does not mention Blink-182 and the many young fans who make the band a success . South Park : Bigger , Longer , Uncut is the authors ' idea of where popular culture is today . Millennials Rising heralds boy bands as what music will increasingly be like as the current decade unfolds , and blasts the "" edgy "" bands as groups that will be washed away , but could the authors have predicted bands like Good Charlotte or artists like Avril Lavigne?This leads to the bigger question of whether the book and the theory will be able to predict anything . S H write about "" rebelling by being better "" during the present decade . Apparently , their idea of rebellion is not listening to Limp Bizkit , blasting censorship , or doing illegal drugs , but wearing preppy clothes , waiting until marriage to have sex , and trusting their government . According to them , we should expect to see Millennials petitioning for policies that will punish their own peers . S H write that we will accept the draft and join the military in great numbers when the crisis presents us with a war , and even do National Service . Frankly , can anyone imagine any more than 20 % of today 's high school students doing their duty and risking their life in war in the name of America ? Also , our generation has done nothing to make a commitment to following Bush as leader during the Iraq War , while S H predict Millennials serving their president . How suited to a Hero generation is that ? The G.I. Generation followed FDR so blindly they had to print his campaign materials in Braille . When it comes to rallying around their president and leading the direction of the nation during a crisis , Millennials have surely disappointed those who expected them to do just as the authors said we would . This , of course , does not have to be a bad thing , but it does make you wonder about the limitations of the predictive abilities of the theory . Some parts of it make for very interesting reading , but all the talk about how they are to be the "" next great "" generation gets to you sometimes . S H seem to believe you can never think too big about those Millennials . Millennials Rising presents an image of youth that is set to amaze you and will attract readers , but sometimes what the book describes just is n't happening",1336,0,0.10160764359332958,0.00011764705882354263,0.00011764705882354263,0.00011764705882354263,0.03139411304818477,0.013916074341755909,0.00011764705882354263,0.13522346787802564,0.00011764705882354263,0.00011764705882354263,0.00011764705882354263,0.00011764705882354263,0.06856441743819175,0.00011764705882354263,0.00011764705882354263,0.00011764705882354263,0.06103359361925351,0.00011764705882354263,0.0059999999999988205,0.00011764705882354263,0.045724397533589936,0.00011764705882354263,0.00011764705882354263,0.020639548150406094,0.05558629675358958,0.07193860490157909,0.006892000078790312,0.00011764705882354263,0.02050827149367301,0.00011764705882354263,0.00011764705882354263,0.03882117206242922,0.030561518233802955,0.00011764705882354263,0.04077155897998294,0.00011764705882354263,0.1410637428932144,0.00011764705882354263,0.00011764705882354263,0.025889231419317753,0.00011764705882354263,0.00011764705882354263,0.00011764705882354263,0.00011764705882354263,0.04573619073088671,0.00011764705882354263,0.034598745085291545,0.00011764705882354263,0.00011764705882354263,0.00011764705882354263,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0

50579,1,"good plot but bad details This book started out good but went downhill quickly because of poor research and virtually NO understanding of computer systems by the author . I do n't mind authors skipping over technical details of computer systems to keep the plot moving , but if the author decides to provide detailed technical descriptions of encrytion codes , firewalls and hacking techniques , those details must be fairly correct . In this case , the technical details were so wildly implausible that I finally had to stop reading . The part where hackers were gradually forcing their way through a firewall to access NSA data were particularly difficult to read without becoming distracted by the absurd details . The NSA almost certainly does n't have computers with highly classified data connected to the internet ( through any combination of firewalls ) but if they did , they could simply disconnect the internet connection if they were being hacked . Besides all that that , the characters were cliched and not well developed .

The underlying theme is about the destruction and shattering of the self . Very poorly written and bad organizatino of his material . There are much better and clearer books on the Holocaust !

50585,1,"Wow its not just me ! I was anxious to read the reviews on this book and I am happy to find its not just me ! Her words and sentences are REDUNDANT ! Yes "" wacky artist "" was used about 50 times in the span of 2 pages ! Liam picked up a poker and scared the daughter ! WE KNOW ! Do n't tell us 100 times ! This is what I think : Either Ms. Steel thinks so little of her devoted audience that she feels we need to be spoon fed the material ... OR she 's just writing whatever comes to mind and no one is editing . Is D. Steel so popular and successful that no one has to proof read her work ? Also , is it cold stone sober ? Or STONE COLD SOBER ? ( it should have been the latter ) No editor caught that mistake ? I 've been a fan of Ms. Steel 's work for 21 years now and the past few year 's works have been deplorable ! I first excused it due to the death of her son .. But her talent never picked up again . From the Ranch onward the books are just pure fluff . If you want to read a novel and not think about what you 're reading ... then read her books , this one especially . If you want to read and process and fall in love with characters try Barbara Delinsky , Luanne Rice , Alison Clement , Susan Wiggs ..",265,0,0.09160910251589784,0.00038461538461542847,0.00038461538461542847,0.00038461538461542847,0.00038461538461542847,0.00038461538461542847,0.00038461538461542847,0.00038461538461542847,0.00038461538461542847,0.00038461538461542847,0.00038461538461542847,0.00038461538461542847,0.3270337113033028,0.00038461538461542847,0.00038461538461542847,0.00038461538461542847,0.00038461538461542847,0.00038461538461542847,0.00038461538461542847,0.00038461538461542847,0.00038461538461542847,0.00038461538461542847,0.00038461538461542847,0.04066055174583421,0.030355716737929014,0.026365167533427165,0.00038461538461542847,0.00038461538461542847,0.00038461538461542847,0.02697610404616307,0.00038461538461542847,0.00038461538461542847,0.00038461538461542847,0.00038461538461542847,0.00038461538461542847,0.00038461538461542847,0.345938199306898,0.00038461538461542847,0.00038461538461542847,0.00038461538461542847,0.049828873441690374,0.045463342599624826,0.00038461538461542847,0.00038461538461542847,0.00038461538461542847,0.00038461538461542847,0.00038461538461542847,0.00038461538461542847,0.00038461538461542847,0.00038461538461542847,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Antony Flew , the world 's number one atheist ( at least with respect to the rare ability to argue his point without using ad hominem arguments ) has recanted his atheism . Philosophically , Flew was a rationalist . Having accepted the empirical evidence of intelligent design in nature , he was able to liberate himself from the tunnel vision of rationalism and hence from the shackles of irrational atheism .

50588,1,"Not for everyone If you are going to Walt Disney World Resort for the first time and want to keep some mystery until you actually ride the attractions , then this book may not be for you . Some of the descriptions for the various attractions go step - by - step through them , including plot points in 3D movies and so on . The book also leaves a lot out in other areas , such as dining ( little coverage ) , getting around Walt Disney World , and off - site hotels and dining . For me , the Unofficial Guide to Walt Disney World ( by Bob Sehlinger ) was much better at giving me the info I needed without giving away any details as to the surprises on the rides . That is , it told me what might frighten a youngster , what might bore an adult , and so on , but it did n't say specifically what would happen at every stage of any of the attractions . Just generalizations about the ride , then specific warnings for different types of people . The only things Birnbaum offers that the Unofficial Guide does n't are pictures and info on some of the ancillary activities such as parasailing . If you have an Internet connection , you do n't need the pictures . And as for the ancillary activities as well as nice maps , you ca n't beat the Passporter book on Disney World . So , for me , the Unofficial Guide plus the Passporter yields the best trip planning library for Walt Disney World . If you like , you can also pick up the EZ - Guide , as it also has some interesting maps and info . As for Birnbaum 's , it really does n't have anything to offer . I would n't recommend against buying it , though , except for the "" let me tell you the plot and ending to the movie before you go "" mentality . I hate spoilers , and wish someone had warned me before I started reading this book",360,0,0.1303054738308568,0.0756805042961173,0.0004000000000000407,0.0004000000000000407,0.0004000000000000407,0.0004000000000000407,0.0004000000000000407,0.1561019218202247,0.0004000000000000407,0.0004000000000000407,0.0004000000000000407,0.0004000000000000407,0.0004000000000000407,0.0004000000000000407,0.020399999999999884,0.0004000000000000407,0.0004000000000000407,0.0004000000000000407,0.0004000000000000407,0.0004000000000000407,0.18934574165875737,0.03118175758637429,0.0004000000000000407,0.0004000000000000407,0.0004000000000000407,0.0004000000000000407,0.0004000000000000407,0.0004000000000000407,0.0004000000000000407,0.0004000000000000407,0.0004000000000000407,0.0004000000000000407,0.049841571669912384,0.0004000000000000407,0.0004000000000000407,0.0004000000000000407,0.25437590289583534,0.0004000000000000407,0.0004000000000000407,0.0004000000000000407,0.0004000000000000407,0.0004000000000000407,0.0004000000000000407,0.0004000000000000407,0.07636712624192037,0.0004000000000000407,0.0004000000000000407,0.0004000000000000407,0.0004000000000000407,0.0004000000000000407,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

Some major early Canadian apostles , such as O.J. Lovik , are skipped entirely . There is also too much opportunity given for some controversial movements to propagandize . A balanced article would necessitate an article by an unbiased observer , rather than by the leaders of those movements .

50635,1,"A find magazine article padded to book length Mr. Winchester takes an interesting subject , collects enough material to make a fine article in , say , National Geographic , and somehow pads it out to several hundred pages in length .

50642,1,"Cambridge 's normal skeptical view Several reviews of this book , published elsewhere , stressthe contents of Rossi 's analysis were more focused toward the skeptical side of Egyptian math and construction methods . Rossi , therefore is being fairly depicted as publishing new information within unproven paradigms . On the math side , Rossi mentions Fibonacci 's algorithmand phi , two paradigms that clearly were not used in ancientEgypt , though many like to suggest that they were . TheFibonacci algorithm idea was introduced after 1891 and J.J. Sylvester 's skeptical views of the RMP 's 2 / nth table , are reference point to 1202 AD and the Liber Abaci , but not a reference point of Egypt . Egypt used more subtle ideaslike http://egyptianmath.blogspot.com and http://akhmimwoodentablet.blogspot.com .Yet , Hultsch in 1895 clearly showed that Ahmes in 1650 BC easily wrote out 2 / p series into short and concise unit fraction series using a very simple partitioning method ( as Ahmes wrote out n / p answers in his ' false position ' algebra problems , ie . 5/19 written out in a long awkward series using 1/12th as the first partition , as he did for 2/19,as describe a couple paragraphs below . Ahmes wrote 5/19per , 5/19 - 1/12 = ( 60 - 19)/(12 * 19 ) = ( 38 + 2 + 1)/(12 * 19)or , 5/19 = 1/6 + 1/12 + 1/114 + 1/228 ) . Clearly modern scholars ( two being Robins - Shute ) have often suggested that ' false supposition ' was used by Ahmes , hintingthat Ahmes guessed at his answers . Ahmes never guessed ! Ahmes'answers were always exact when he worked with rational numbers . Moderm scholars were the ones that had guessed , and missed , finding Ahmes deeper methods . Interestingly no scholar , untilvery recently , has claimed to have read Ahmes ' shorthandnotes . Modern scholars had sadly filled inlogical gaps leftby Ahmes with their own intellectual guesses - many of whichhave been proven to be wrong ( as Rossi had not learned , sincehe referenced none of the controversial Eguptian fraction and weights and measures issues).Bruins also discovered the Hultsch method in 1945 , and today the method is named the Hultsch - Bruin method . It says that2 / p = 1 / A + ( 2A -p)/Apwhere A , a highly divisible number selected in the range p/2 lt ; A lt ; pwith the divisors of A uniquely added to ( 2A -p)thereby solving ( 2A - p)/Ap . Example,2/19 = 1/12 + ( 24 -19)/(12 * 19 ) = 1/12 + ( 3 + 2)/(12 * 19 ) = 1/12 + 1/76 + 1/114with the ( 4 + 1 ) alternative being discardedsince its last denominator was too large . Rossi also mentions that Egyptian division may have followedan inverse operation of its multiplication ' doubling ' method . Here also Rossi did not seen the simple remainder arithmeticfound in RMP # 62 where 100/13 = 7 + 9/13 = 7 + 2/3 + 1/39.Generally Ahmes and all scribes divided by this Q = quotientand R = remainder method . The Akhmim Wooden Tablet even shows a special method for grain and volume division wherea hekat unity 64/64 was divided by n , with n lt ; 64 , as(64/64)/n = Q/64 + R/(n*64)Even more interesting , Ahmes also used this method to divide 100 hekat by 70 , with his final form matchingthe Akhmim Wooden tablet 's special use of ro = 1/320thof a hekat , by:(6400/64)/70 = 91/64 + 30/(70 * 64)and introducing ro = 1/320 of a hekat , = ( 1 +16 + 8 + 2 + 1)/64 = ( 150/70 ) * 1/320 = 1 + 1/4 + 1/8 + 1/32 + 1/64 + ( 2 + 1/7)*roI'll not go on and discuss Rossi ' view of Egyptianarchitecture being the above her standard Cambridge skeptical comments . Overall , many accept Rossi 's view as informative , and I do as well , in limited areas . However , on the math side of Rossi 's quick use of a Sylvester 's andother recent skeptical techniques , all disproven years ago , shows that her Cambridge training needs to be expandedto read the Egyptian mathematical texts . Clearly Ahmesand his brother / sister scribes are the only experts that should guide our understanding of Egyptian math .",744,0,0.0003076923076923392,0.0003076923076923392,0.0003076923076923392,0.0003076923076923392,0.0003076923076923392,0.0003076923076923392,0.031758832915780376,0.09940421151700009,0.0003076923076923392,0.0003076923076923392,0.0003076923076923392,0.015740045779133075,0.0003076923076923392,0.0003076923076923392,0.0003076923076923392,0.0003076923076923392,0.0003076923076923392,0.0003076923076923392,0.015692303814253992,0.0003076923076923392,0.0003076923076923392,0.0003076923076923392,0.026596021336759007,0.0821562390294473,0.020774550432799414,0.0003076923076923392,0.0003076923076923392,0.0003076923076923392,0.0003076923076923392,0.0003076923076923392,0.0003076923076923392,0.0003076923076923392,0.0003076923076923392,0.0003076923076923392,0.0003076923076923392,0.0003076923076923392,0.10107855332995162,0.0003076923076923392,0.12790787765546233,0.0003076923076923392,0.04038281574698823,0.0003076923076923392,0.0003076923076923392,0.0003076923076923392,0.11756705827607203,0.16743307604375876,0.14212379873797734,0.0003076923076923392,0.0003076923076923392,0.0003076923076923392,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0

This book sets shamefully low standards for the church 's role in reshaping society , even as it sets admirably high standards for individual men 's thought - lives",291,0,0.17849666218205767,0.0004347826086956783,0.03188645912892371,0.0004347826086956783,0.022594241415241318,0.022804893405670223,0.0004347826086956783,0.5350114136200859,0.0004347826086956783,0.0004347826086956783,0.0004347826086956783,0.0004347826086956783,0.0004347826086956783,0.0004347826086956783,0.0004347826086956783,0.0004347826086956783,0.0004347826086956783,0.0004347826086956783,0.0004347826086956783,0.0004347826086956783,0.0004347826086956783,0.0004347826086956783,0.0004347826086956783,0.0004347826086956783,0.0004347826086956783,0.054776798660066676,0.0004347826086956783,0.0004347826086956783,0.0004347826086956783,0.0004347826086956783,0.0004347826086956783,0.0004347826086956783,0.030050244558354387,0.0004347826086956783,0.0004347826086956783,0.0004347826086956783,0.10611841746438154,0.0004347826086956783,0.0004347826086956783,0.0004347826086956783,0.0004347826086956783,0.0004347826086956783,0.0004347826086956783,0.0004347826086956783,0.0004347826086956783,0.0004347826086956783,0.0004347826086956783,0.0004347826086956783,0.0004347826086956783,0.0004347826086956783,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

With another implausible plot twist , I 've had enough .

I've read quite a number of Deaver 's novels and enjoyed the complex plots and the exploration of psychologically / psyciatrically devient chbaracters , but this is just over the top .

50686,1,"disheartened I came to Blowback by way of a year - long research project on globalization . Over the past year I have read dozens of books , both scholary and popular , on this topic . Right - Left - Love America - Hate America - Multi - Cultural - Eurocentric ; I 've suffered through them all ( happily , there is as yet no feminist perspective on the subject ) . First let me state that Chalmers Johnson , this regrettable book notwithstanding , is not by profession the village diot . Johnson is a highly respected economic and political analyst , a man who used to be worth listening to . What happened ? How did he come to cobble together this breathtakingly unanalytical smorgasborg ? Where did the imperialist conspiracy rant come from ? Johnson , where did you go?Well , the easy answer is that he delves into complex areas of which he has no knowledge . His take on America 's military policies is ludicrous . Anyone who questions why the U.S. Army is still in Korea after 50 + years need only point to Seoul on a map and drag his finger a couple of inches north , where he will discover NORTH KOREA . Of coures once an idealogue veers into unknown territory there is no other path left for him than that of conspiracy . Conspiracy "" theory "" is all fine and good for the lazy and uneducated ; it 's their sanctuary ; but for a scholar of Johnson 's caliber to go there is incomprehensible . Unti you see what I saw . The professional works that I read on globalization were pretty much uniform in that they addressed one or another facet of free - trade and concluded more - or - less - nothing , all in scholarly language . For the most part the popular books were not nominally about globalization at all , although globalization was the only thread holding the books together , and to each other . Brushing aside the fact that most of the authors of the popular group are ageing oddballs from the 60s ( you underestimate the mustard - gas - like effect of that era at your peril ) , the only possible reason for these immensely angry , nonsensical books is this : no one fully understands globalization . No one . Even when you define the thing narrowly it is a cantankerous beast , too young to tame ; growing unpredictably every day like the Blob . They 're frustrated , these authors .

50688,1,"Do n't fail to read this if you 're new to Earth In today 's world , various forms of parochialism have a dialectical relationship with the homogenizing influences of globalizing consumer capitalism . These forms of parochialism may be ethnic , "" cultural , "" religious , nationalistic , etc . , depending on where you look . On one hand , ancient forms of identity continue to define in - groups and out - groups ; on the other hand , multinational corporations elide these differences as they operate in a wider and wider worldwide marketplace . Example : the Turks and the Armenians hate each other and even partly define themselves by this ancient conflict ( "" Jihad "" is Barber 's label for this ) ; yet they see the same Pepsi ads and do the same kinds of work in their local Pepsi bottling plants ( "" McWorld "" is Barber 's label for this).That 's the book . This might be a useful resource for writers of term papers who need to endnote something fairly obvious . Outside of that , it would take an observer from another planet to find this book 's insights novel or pointed . If you 're new to planet Earth , by all means pick up a copy . It will catch you up on a few useful truisms . As others have pointed out , the "" terrorism 's challenge to democracy "" subtitle seems intended to capitalize on 9/11 , but does n't accurately reflect the book 's content .

She alternates between patronizing her subjects ( the very notion of calling them "" my girls , "" for instance ) and setting them up primarily as sources of voyeuristic thrills for the herself and the reader .

50709,1,"Read this only with a wider range of Christian thinkers Toward the end of How Now Shall We Live , Chuck Colson states , regarding popular music and media , that a little cotton candy is permissible as part of a healthy diet . However , he warns , a diet of junk food can be fatal . Good advice concerning pop culture - but even more applicable to this book . Yes , it contains a kernel of truth , but it ultimately is dangerous if not balanced by a heavy diet of other thinkers and theologians such as Thomas Merton , St. Francis of Assisi , Ron Sider , Tony Campolo , Brian McLaren , Brother Lawrence , Philip Yancey , Wendell Berry - the list goes on . It often is guilty of oversimplifying the ideological conflicts the modern Church faces , drawing the lines down to "" Christians "" against the "" naturalists "" or "" humanists , "" thus ignoring the wide range of threats that seek to destroy the Church . While there is truth in Colson 's writing , I believe it ultimately stems from a flawed worldview - one defined largely by comfortable middle - class American thought and militaristic nationalism , sprinkled with the politically correct amount of Christian belief . His faith seems to be overly academic , one that favors rhetoric and proof over prayer and other spiritual disciplines . Evangelism , it seems to Colson , is comprised heavily of apologetics . The secularists must be shown that they are wrong , he says . Yes , there is truth and there is time for debate , but this book seems to prefer winning debates over building bridges and relationships . You see , I used to fear evolutionists and the proverbial round table of "" secular humanists "" that many conservative evangelicals love to discuss . But as I 've grown , I realize that threats to the Church come more often from within than from secular culture , and they almost always have more to do with power and politics than the Enlightenment or science .",360,0,0.3088264432627076,0.0006060606060606715,0.0006060606060606715,0.0006060606060606715,0.0006060606060606715,0.0006060606060606715,0.0006060606060606715,0.2348461111458883,0.0006060606060606715,0.0006060606060606715,0.0006060606060606715,0.0006060606060606715,0.052132990339877956,0.0006060606060606715,0.0006060606060606715,0.0006060606060606715,0.0006060606060606715,0.0006060606060606715,0.0006060606060606715,0.0006060606060606715,0.0006060606060606715,0.0006060606060606715,0.0006060606060606715,0.0006060606060606715,0.0006060606060606715,0.0006060606060606715,0.0006060606060606715,0.0006060606060606715,0.033415947929786305,0.031836107774316405,0.0006060606060606715,0.030933169755100815,0.0006060606060606715,0.0006060606060606715,0.09836129362637132,0.0006060606060606715,0.1538903604083717,0.0006060606060606715,0.0006060606060606715,0.0006060606060606715,0.0006060606060606715,0.030909090909092166,0.0006060606060606715,0.0006060606060606715,0.0006060606060606715,0.0006060606060606715,0.0006060606060606715,0.0006060606060606715,0.0006060606060606715,0.0006060606060606715,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

50748,1,"Astoundingly Poor If an author sets out to write a collection of short stories about adultery , you 'd think they 'd have a lo say about it , right ? Well , Ford certainly expends plenty of words , but the net impact of them is next to nothing by the end of this incredibly feeble navel - gazing group of stories . Mind - numbingly similar in tone and temperament , the ten stories center of upper and upper - middle class white , middle - aged , married professionals who seem to have drifted into infidelity . Story after story plods cautiously along , poking at the consequences of adultery in a very mild way , with leaden dialogue and a lot of empty moodiness . Adultery is treated almost as a kind of bland rite - of - passage for a disconnected male . Marital infidelity can happen in so many ways for so many reasons , and yet Ford seems interested in only a very limited field of it . I have no idea what his personal background or situation is , but it 's a collection you read and leave wishing the author had worked out their issues in therapy or something . If he was n't such a literary bigshot , there 's no way this would have been published - it strikes the same note over and over and over , and is n't provocative , insightful , or even interesting . PS . If you were planning on the audio version , do n't .

He followed the most moral and meritocratic theory for wealth and value : an object is worth as much as the effort it takes to make . "" NO IT 'S NOT ! ! ! An object 's worth is based upon both the supply of an object and the demand for it arrising from consumers . To imply that it comes from the effort it takes to make implies that a milkshake that takes only a few minutes to make is worth far less than a vial of poison that took an hour to make or an atomic bomb that took months to make , which would mean that we should subsidize the military - industrial complex , since all those workers worked hard to create those deadly things . "" Petty - bourgeois ' owners , i.e. the mom - and - pop stores and small business in general , of which my grandpa , a dentist , was a part of , are being driven under by corporate chain competition in retail . "" This is either to the innefficiency in their store to meet consumer demands or to the massive regulations burdened upon them by the government . All regulations do nothing but add an increased burden on to competition and thus kills them out . There 's a reason why the owner 's of Wal - Mart recently said that the federal government should increase the minimum wage to over $ 8 , as this would cause many smaller businesses to go bankrupt , lay off employees , and prevent future businesses from starting up to compete with Wal - Mart . Another problem is the subsidies that the smaller store pays to Wal - Mart ( Wal - Mart collects millions in subsidies due to Marx 's Labor Theory of Value once again ) and of the use of emminent domain abuse ( which can be justified on the grounds of the "" greater good "" as opposed to the individual good of your mom and pop stores ) . "" But no theory is ever flawless , and socialists should be able to correct their past flaws to account for human nature and "" reality . "" There is no reason to believe that heavy social hierarchy and class division is a necessary evil ; workers CAN manage their lives just fine through cooperatives . "" Sure there is . Human beings are inherently unequal , differing in many skills , abilities , ambition , the choices that they make in life , how they apply their time , etc . etc . Of course , there is is n't any reason that individuals ca n't create wealth nonetheless , creating goods and services that help others out in exchange for some good or service itself . And cooperatives need to be voluntary first . Nor can cooperatives produce the bulk of wealth . There needs to be some Division of Labor , Trade and Commerce , etc . or else all cooperatives end up as hunter - gatherering tribes reduced to the real law of the jungle to survive . This ca n't happen if everything is collectively owned . "" Since workers are the sole producers of goods from scratch to end "" NO ! Entreprenuers , innovators , etc . provide much of the creativity , design , direction for the purchase and use of capital goods , negotiation of deals , evaluation of threats , problems , and consumer requests , and other such things . It was n't the workers at Microsoft who created cheap desktop computers , it was Bill Gates , the workers are merely a form of mass - production who help out , but ultimately mass produce a good or service in exchange for privately owned wages , caused by supply and demand .",671,0,0.0002597402597402867,0.043678136645636786,0.0002597402597402867,0.0002597402597402867,0.0002597402597402867,0.07708579326053465,0.0002597402597402867,0.13767601717161984,0.018808547320988436,0.0002597402597402867,0.0002597402597402867,0.0002597402597402867,0.0002597402597402867,0.0002597402597402867,0.0002597402597402867,0.0002597402597402867,0.0002597402597402867,0.0002597402597402867,0.013246753246751394,0.0002597402597402867,0.0002597402597402867,0.0002597402597402867,0.02920098013442274,0.0002597402597402867,0.013232288055475789,0.0002597402597402867,0.11134334474722583,0.0002597402597402867,0.0002597402597402867,0.013736237198761731,0.0002597402597402867,0.0002597402597402867,0.21511546222231936,0.0002597402597402867,0.039423728401301275,0.0002597402597402867,0.0002597402597402867,0.0002597402597402867,0.023369251985687,0.16295167638517552,0.07224869734134051,0.0002597402597402867,0.01979217679184913,0.0002597402597402867,0.0002597402597402867,0.0002597402597402867,0.0002597402597402867,0.0002597402597402867,0.0002597402597402867,0.0002597402597402867,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

50792,1,"Not Christie 's best Hmmm . I 'm struggling to give Agatha Christie such a low rating . She wrote the kind of mysteries that you could sink your teeth into . Not quick reads , but very methodical with lots of character development . I do n't always feel very motivated to get through some of those slow - moving chapters , but I always do it knowing that I will be rewarded with a great ending . Christie was great at spinning scenarios designed to shock the reader when the quot;who , where and why quot ; were finally revealed in the end . I was shocked again at the end of this book - not because I did n't know who the killer was , but actually because I already knew who and how . I tried to convince myself for awhile that it had to be someone else because it was just too obvious . Very disappointing .

50897,1,Review Krakauer is highly confused and I can tell that so are some of these reviewers . He can not give insight into or shed light on something he knows little truth about himself . The church he is talking about is completley separate from The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - Day Saints . Jon Krakauer is nothing more than an sadly misinformed and idiotic person trying to enlighten his readers with things he has misinterpreted . Books like these are written on every religion with hopes of discouraging the believers and proving to those that do n't believe -that their assumptions were correct,106,0,0.001333333333333398,0.001333333333333398,0.001333333333333398,0.001333333333333398,0.001333333333333398,0.001333333333333398,0.001333333333333398,0.6379853670496614,0.001333333333333398,0.001333333333333398,0.001333333333333398,0.06800000000000125,0.0013333333333333983,0.001333333333333398,0.001333333333333398,0.001333333333333398,0.001333333333333398,0.001333333333333398,0.001333333333333398,0.001333333333333398,0.001333333333333398,0.001333333333333398,0.001333333333333398,0.001333333333333398,0.001333333333333398,0.001333333333333398,0.001333333333333398,0.001333333333333398,0.001333333333333398,0.001333333333333398,0.001333333333333398,0.001333333333333398,0.001333333333333398,0.001333333333333398,0.001333333333333398,0.001333333333333398,0.1531375264298839,0.001333333333333398,0.001333333333333398,0.001333333333333398,0.001333333333333398,0.001333333333333398,0.001333333333333398,0.001333333333333398,0.07954377318711732,0.001333333333333398,0.001333333333333398,0.001333333333333398,0.001333333333333398,0.001333333333333398,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

50909,1,"A Great Effort Sadly Lacking I held great hopes for this book -- Duveen has long been of interest to me because of the pivotal role he played in the creation of some of the greatest art collections in this country .

To say the book is disorganized is to deal in serious understatement . But worse than that are the inaccuracies , especially when she writes about Duveen 's customers . Just for starters , apparently she did n't recognize the need to differentiate between John D. Rockefeller , Jr. and his father ( or maybe she did n't know there has been more than one JDR ! ) . You wo n't learn much from this tome that you do n't know to begin , and getting through it will be a struggle .",171,0,0.0006451612903226277,0.0006451612903226277,0.0006451612903226277,0.0006451612903226277,0.1210174904614025,0.0006451612903226277,0.0006451612903226277,0.14331019132801145,0.0006451612903226277,0.0006451612903226277,0.0006451612903226277,0.0006451612903226277,0.26123939944475905,0.0006451612903226277,0.0006451612903226277,0.0006451612903226277,0.0006451612903226277,0.0006451612903226277,0.0006451612903226277,0.0006451612903226277,0.0006451612903226277,0.0006451612903226277,0.0006451612903226277,0.0006451612903226277,0.0006451612903226277,0.0006451612903226277,0.0006451612903226277,0.0006451612903226277,0.0006451612903226277,0.0006451612903226277,0.0006451612903226277,0.0006451612903226277,0.14116620339272345,0.0006451612903226277,0.0006451612903226277,0.0006451612903226277,0.2028626139879903,0.0006451612903226277,0.0006451612903226277,0.0006451612903226277,0.0006451612903226277,0.10201700461091771,0.0006451612903226277,0.0006451612903226277,0.0006451612903226277,0.0006451612903226277,0.0006451612903226277,0.0006451612903226277,0.0006451612903226277,0.0006451612903226277,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

50955,1,No Way Anyone who knows me would tell you I truly enjoy reading . I am an avid reader known to finish an interesting book within hours . It took me two weeks to get past the first seven chapters of this book . The story just could not keep my interest . I felt no real affinity to any of the characters . I have other books by this author and come away with an interst in what would happen next with her lead characters . She writes with real emphasis on how characters interact with each other and usually leaves you wanting more . In the case of this novel I just did n't feel it . Her other novels will not leave you dissapointed . Ugly ways is not a good example of the Ansa 's true talent as a writer . If you have not done so try her other novels . I guarantee you will come away wanting to read more,166,0,0.0004878048780488223,0.0004878048780488223,0.0004878048780488223,0.07417079443902556,0.0004878048780488223,0.02535124586919182,0.0004878048780488223,0.0004878048780488223,0.0004878048780488223,0.0004878048780488223,0.0004878048780488223,0.0004878048780488223,0.0004878048780488223,0.0004878048780488223,0.0004878048780488223,0.0004878048780488223,0.11913874974071616,0.0004878048780488223,0.0004878048780488223,0.0004878048780488223,0.0004878048780488223,0.0004878048780488223,0.0004878048780488223,0.0004878048780488223,0.0004878048780488223,0.0004878048780488223,0.0004878048780488223,0.0004878048780488223,0.0004878048780488223,0.0004878048780488223,0.0004878048780488223,0.0004878048780488223,0.0004878048780488223,0.0004878048780488223,0.22132361803428083,0.0004878048780488223,0.5380643724045885,0.0004878048780488223,0.0004878048780488223,0.0004878048780488223,0.0004878048780488223,0.0004878048780488223,0.0004878048780488223,0.0004878048780488223,0.0004878048780488223,0.0004878048780488223,0.0004878048780488223,0.0004878048780488223,0.0004878048780488223,0.0004878048780488223,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

50964,1,"Misinformation and Euro - centric You can tell I do n't pay attention to Wall Street Journal or New York Times . I picked up David Sacks ' book from Borders ' Linguistics stack because of the title . I should have known better . I started the first chapter and did n't have the time or intention to finish it . The book is a collection of charts and stories about the history of alphabetic writing that are to be expected from the title -- in some cases conviniently summarized things in tables and maps -- but lacks , in my opinion , systematic thinking on the reasons behind the origin and prosperity of alphabetic writing that is found in other scholarly works ( scholarly it is not ) . Even within the first 20 pages or so , I was disawayed more than a few times by dubious claims , utter misinformation , and distastefully Euro / English - centric . Here are some examples:""The alphabet was not the earliest writing : Egypt , Mesopotamia , and probably China already had nonalphabetic systems . But the alphabet was the most efficient writing system ever found , before or since ( p.1 ) "" -- What about Hirogana for Japanese ? Syllabaries can be much more efficient for languages that do not have a large inventory of syllables . "" The ' spreadability ' of an alphabet means that the future of our Roman letters looks very bright indeed . ( p. 10 ) "" -- He was speaking of languages that are written in multiple alphabets , such as Swahili , Serbo - Croatian , Urdu / Hindi , and Yiddish . And then came this proud comment on the prospect "" our Roman letters "" . Immediately following the above quote , he gave examples of Azerbaijian and Tatarstan 's decision to switch to Roman , as well as other "" struggling nation "" 's likewise decisions to "" switch to Roman letters for native tongues , as a big to tie into global trade and communications and to better prepare their prople to learn English . Tragically , much that is venerable and spiritually sustaining while be lost . Yet that seems inevitable in the 21st century were are shaping . And it is sobering to reflect that our 26 letters wield such power . ""His view of the learnability of the alphabet is also uneducated , shall I say . The following superficial comment could have come from an old gradama who happened have NOT been a teacher for her lifetime . "" An alphabet enjoys on huge advantage over any other writing system : It needs fewer symbols . No other sysmtem can get away with so few . This makes an alphabet easier to learn . Students need memorize only two dozen or so letters to begin building toward literacy , which typically takes about another five years of instruction "" . And -- he writes -- because of this simplicity , children can become literate before the working age . "" This cricial fact has made the alphabet historically the vehicle of mass literacy . ( p.5 ) "" Well , "" vehicle "" is a very clevery way of framing it . At least he is not saying that where there is alphabet there is mass literacy . Mass literacy was nevery a goal before the inducstry revolution . Now Sacks joins the ranks of you - know - who 's by implying that the Europeans and Western ideals were destined to take over the world because they had the alphabet and probably the mandate from God . ( Guns , what guns?)Sacks also compared "" our 26 letters "" -- as if alphabetic writing is patented at the USPO -- to Chinese . "" Today Chinese schoolchildren normally take three years longer than Western children to learn to read and write , with most of that extra time devoted to mastering the symbols . "" This is completely misinformation . Learning to read Chinese is not easy , but do a little research , you will find studies over studies and books over books on comparitive studies of literacy ( including my own ) . I 've nevery seen a credible study that substantiates the 3-year lag . By the way , Sacks almost never gives citations . I think that 's enough . This explains my total disappointment with the book -- I sholdn't have any high expectation from the start , had I known who David Sacks is .",771,0,0.00021739130434785081,0.0544511430720079,0.00021739130434785081,0.021445523341877833,0.00021739130434785081,0.00021739130434785081,0.00021739130434785081,0.11720463579232987,0.00021739130434785081,0.00021739130434785081,0.00021739130434785081,0.00021739130434785081,0.00021739130434785081,0.00021739130434785081,0.00021739130434785081,0.00021739130434785081,0.00021739130434785081,0.00021739130434785081,0.011086956521738542,0.00021739130434785081,0.00021739130434785081,0.00021739130434785081,0.00021739130434785081,0.025344561076613266,0.00021739130434785081,0.00021739130434785081,0.00021739130434785081,0.00021739130434785081,0.00021739130434785081,0.04940871698904916,0.00021739130434785081,0.00021739130434785081,0.10092327504314655,0.00021739130434785081,0.06367808985229621,0.011236157278642266,0.3575995808349744,0.028221084511487936,0.00021739130434785081,0.00021739130434785081,0.10308918614265643,0.011139324569169893,0.00021739130434785081,0.00021739130434785081,0.00021739130434785081,0.037345678017487165,0.00021739130434785081,0.00021739130434785081,0.00021739130434785081,0.00021739130434785081,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
50969,1,"My Brother 's Experience With The Perricone Prescription My brother had severe acne a year or so ago that he inherited from my Dad 's side of the family . He had tried antibiotics with no success and wanted to go on Accutane . Having heard bad things about the side effects , my Dad wanted my brother to try the diet for a couple months before deciding to take the medication . He faithfully followed it with no results whatsoever . Some of the ideas in the book are absurd - as a diabetic with a horrible eating habit and no teenage acne , I can tell you that the focus on dieting and insulin spikes as a direct cause of of the condition is preposterous . When I was a teenager , I 'd go on serious candy binges that required insulin doses bordering on the irresponsible , and I got through high school with only the occasional zit . I 've read that for a small number of people , diet can be a factor for acne , but obviously our experience points to something else as the primary cause ( this assumes you eat reasonably well - malnutrition is n't sexy ) . Since medication should always be a last resort , a change of diet is probably a good first approach for those with minor blemishes , but those with a serious condition should look elsewhere . For the curious , while my brother had some strong side effects from the Accutane ( none dangerous , primarily incredibly dry skin and eyes ) , it certainly succeeded in clearing up his skin",277,0,0.0005714285714286215,0.0005714285714286215,0.0005714285714286215,0.0005714285714286215,0.0005714285714286215,0.0005714285714286215,0.05950524445564377,0.0005714285714286215,0.0005714285714286215,0.0005714285714286215,0.0005714285714286215,0.0005714285714286215,0.37264101606744887,0.0005714285714286215,0.0005714285714286215,0.0005714285714286215,0.0005714285714286215,0.0005714285714286215,0.0005714285714286215,0.0005714285714286215,0.0005714285714286215,0.0005714285714286215,0.0005714285714286215,0.0005714285714286215,0.03602279434852644,0.11240467769545745,0.0005714285714286215,0.0005714285714286215,0.0005714285714286215,0.0005714285714286215,0.0005714285714286215,0.0005714285714286215,0.0005714285714286215,0.0005714285714286215,0.0005714285714286215,0.0005714285714286215,0.09548282489611473,0.0005714285714286215,0.0005714285714286215,0.0005714285714286215,0.04955131857171039,0.0005714285714286215,0.033522668188955315,0.0005714285714286215,0.09542799918198071,0.12201288516558868,0.0005714285714286215,0.0005714285714286215,0.0005714285714286215,0.0005714285714286215,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0
50990,1,"Repackaged prepared foods I was INCREDIBLY disappointed with this book purchase - especially because I paid FULL PRICE for it . I have absolutely NO USE for it . Why ? Why pay money for a book that simply takes prepackaged cookie and cake mixes , and adds a handful of nuts or dried fruit , ( thus , making it "" homemade "" ) to give away ? Anyone with the smallest amount of natural creativity could do this on their own , without the instruction of a cookbook . Let me give you an example : One of the "" recipes "" in this book is for lollipops . You melt down other lollipops or pieces of hard candy and drop a stick in the puddle . WOW . That is CRAFTY . How ridiculous . Even worse , - as you will see by the illustration , - the "" homemade "" ' lollipop ' looks disgusting . The stick is about four times as thick as the paper - thin puddle of liquified old hard candy . I would n't DARE give such a thing away as a GIFT . Only a handful of recipes in this book are actually scratch - made from ingredients . The premise of this book is dressing up premade prepackaged foods from your local grocery store , and slapping some notions from the craft store on a glass jar or paper box . While some of the presentation ideas are original and attractive , in general it will prove a grave disappointment to an experienced cook . I have given this book two stars because it does present lovely photo illustrations of every "" recipe "" , and may give you inspiration for packaging and presenting your best recipes as gifts ...... but if you have any creative talent and cooking skill whatsoever , - I advise you to seek out another book on this subject . It is not worth the cost of the book . Should you be interested in the simplicity and economical value ( the craft notions to dress the package will cost more than the food you are preparing)found in this book , - PLEASE- buy a USED copy , - it is n't worth more than $ 3 bucks .

50999,1,"Okay for ideas This book is the typical package of business ideas . The book gets 2 stars because the few pages devoted to entrepreneurship has very little substance and the information under each idea is sparse and in many cases not helpful . In addition , there are numerous ideas that require a tremendous amount of work . The author does state that what may be work for one person , may be play to another . However , this relates to doing something you enjoy or having a passion where you do n't mind putting in the time or work . The title suggests that the business ideas listed in the book will not require a great deal of time or effort , which is not the case for many of the ideas(Masonry , Restauranteur for example).This book has some value for those that have not read similar books of this type .

51016,1,"Highly Satisfying Novel , Despite the Blood and Guts While expertly crafted , this is not a pretty novel , nor is it gentle . The subject matter -- abduction of a child -- is somber , as are a few gruesome descriptions of death and dying . The plot twists and turns , as befits a LeHane novel , and one way or another this complicated story finds its way to a denouement which the reader may not find satisfying . But you can usually trust Lehane to take good care of you in this , one of his finer books .

51040,1,"A tragic story , magnificently written This is the story of another tragic episode involving a Native American tribe . That this probably happened under other circumstances , and happened to more than the Arapaho tribe , can not be doubted . This is another in a series that has given us insight into tribal life and continues to leave us wanting more . The characters are strong , believable , and you want the best for all of them . The underlying plot -- selling tribal babies and telling their parents they died -- is heartbreaking . The reunion of one such child with her father made me weep . And Vicki 's trial reconciliation with Ben gave me hope .

51049,1,"Helpful as a Backdrop Before Reading Paul 's Epistles We know some things about Saul of Tarsus ( later named the Apostle Paul ) but a complete biography is always lacking because of sketchy and incomplete information . Most everything we know from Paul is from the Dr. Luke in the Book of Acts or Paul 's epistles themselves . II Peter Chapter 3 makes some very intriguing statements . Peter , in some of his last earthly words before martyrdom , validates Paul 's apostleship and states that some of his writings and teachings are difficult but that we should follow them . Pollock 's book is presented as documentary - style reading since Paul 's complete biography is not entirely clear . There is much the author states is inference or speculation . If you can respect that and not build doctrine and facts on where the evidence is fuzzy , I think this is an excellent book . One example of "" fuzzy "" facts that Pollock considers is the age - old controversy over the authorship of the Book of Hebrews . The author of Hebrews does not identify himself and scholars argue who wrote it . Pollock speculates that Paul , while imprisioned in Acts Ch . 24 for two years may have had time and motivation to write the book to the people he so desparately wanted to reach . With his imprisonment and his controversial style among the Jews , he may have left his identity anonymous so he himself would not be a stumbling block to reach his Jewish brothers . Eternity will reveal who wrote the Book of Hebrews but it is certainly a plausible theory . Overall , the greatest benefit in reading this book is to provide a better framework for understanding Paul as he travels among the early churches and wrote letters to them correcting the various false teachings and problems that developed .",326,1,0.09357071760578972,0.00046511627906979983,0.00046511627906979983,0.00046511627906979983,0.00046511627906979983,0.00046511627906979983,0.00046511627906979983,0.00046511627906979983,0.00046511627906979983,0.00046511627906979983,0.00046511627906979983,0.00046511627906979983,0.00046511627906979983,0.00046511627906979983,0.00046511627906979983,0.00046511627906979983,0.00046511627906979983,0.00046511627906979983,0.00046511627906979983,0.00046511627906979983,0.00046511627906979983,0.00046511627906979983,0.00046511627906979983,0.0368595186357422,0.00046511627906979983,0.00046511627906979983,0.035739463987306916,0.00046511627906979983,0.00046511627906979983,0.00046511627906979983,0.00046511627906979983,0.00046511627906979983,0.00046511627906979983,0.00046511627906979983,0.030535597355145168,0.00046511627906979983,0.6665604549354914,0.00046511627906979983,0.08611301994788435,0.00046511627906979983,0.030621227532638646,0.00046511627906979983,0.00046511627906979983,0.00046511627906979983,0.00046511627906979983,0.00046511627906979983,0.00046511627906979983,0.00046511627906979983,0.00046511627906979983,0.00046511627906979983,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

51074,1,Anyone who makes decisions should read this This is not a book about management . It is a wonderful exploration about how and why groups of individuals can and do make better decisions than individuals . It sets out some necessary conditions for this wisdom to be able to take place and then does some excellent analysis of why that happens . What I got out of this book was some very important ideas about why collaborative decision making is important and how to assure that it is done well ( If you want the other side Irving Janis ' old classic on Groupthink is a good counterpoint . ) Unlike a lot of other big idea books this one is very literate and readable . It is a joy to read but it also offers some very substantive ideas,140,1,0.1824758475080946,0.0008000000000000426,0.0008000000000000426,0.0008000000000000426,0.0008000000000000426,0.0008000000000000426,0.0008000000000000426,0.0008000000000000426,0.0008000000000000426,0.0008000000000000426,0.0008000000000000426,0.04080000000000037,0.0008000000000000426,0.0008000000000000426,0.0008000000000000426,0.0008000000000000426,0.0754706198521647,0.0008000000000000426,0.0008000000000000426,0.0008000000000000426,0.0008000000000000426,0.0008000000000000426,0.0008000000000000426,0.04779136238127632,0.0008000000000000426,0.0008000000000000426,0.06092619473811458,0.0008000000000000426,0.0008000000000000426,0.03572396451857665,0.0008000000000000426,0.0008000000000000426,0.0008000000000000426,0.0008000000000000426,0.0008000000000000426,0.0008000000000000426,0.35292684723161666,0.0008000000000000426,0.05391941679222857,0.11716574697792585,0.0008000000000000426,0.0008000000000000426,0.0008000000000000426,0.0008000000000000426,0.0008000000000000426,0.0008000000000000426,0.0008000000000000426,0.0008000000000000426,0.0008000000000000426,0.0008000000000000426,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

51085,1,"Mr. Lynch Shares More of His Expertise ... When Peter S. Lynch speaks , wise investors will listen . This book covers the famous fund manager 's career at the helm of Fidelity Magellan from 1977 to ' 90 , and post career into ' 92 . It 's far more introspective than "" One Up On Wall Street "" and it was no doubt meant to be for this purpose . For example , there is n't nearly as much fundamental principles for stock picking outlined in this book as the former . My belief is that the reader would do best by reading "" One Up On Wall Street "" first and follow up with this title , as its the newer of the two , regardless . Peter 's style of writing ( with John Rothchild ) is no - nonsense and easy to take in . To my knowledge three books have been published by the duo and all three have been entertaining and never dry . The reader can comfortably take in some very important stock - picking principles from one of the greats without feeling intimidated at any point . I think this is a sign of a well written book that covers a topic that is n't child 's play ( unless you like playing with money).And although this book does n't cover nearly as much technical information as the first , it still offers a lot of tasty tidbits for stock pickers . I made plenty of notes while reading "" Beating The Street "" , and I 'm confident that I 'll be well served by doing so . Peter reiterates many of the guidelines he mentioned in his first best - seller , such as scrutinizing company earnings and the balance sheets , and he gives his wise opinion of picking bargain stocks that have lower P / Es than their growth rates . Overall , this title definitely deserves four stars , and his first book deserves at least five stars . Lynch and Rothchild have authored several investing books that will stand the test of time . You 'll sleep better with your investment decisions by having these valuable classics in your collection .",376,1,0.0003773584905660857,0.0003773584905660857,0.0003773584905660857,0.0003773584905660857,0.0003773584905660857,0.0003773584905660857,0.0003773584905660857,0.05395896911591015,0.055504727184503534,0.0003773584905660857,0.0003773584905660857,0.0003773584905660857,0.0003773584905660857,0.0003773584905660857,0.0003773584905660857,0.0003773584905660857,0.0003773584905660857,0.0003773584905660857,0.0003773584905660857,0.0003773584905660857,0.0003773584905660857,0.07193159969351529,0.0003773584905660857,0.0003773584905660857,0.0003773584905660857,0.0003773584905660857,0.0003773584905660857,0.0003773584905660857,0.0003773584905660857,0.0003773584905660857,0.0003773584905660857,0.0209970776899743,0.053006198158731616,0.0003773584905660857,0.0003773584905660857,0.03937415280736403,0.5483124318881422,0.0003773584905660857,0.0003773584905660857,0.0369338139684286,0.0003773584905660857,0.020276163408975444,0.0003773584905660857,0.0003773584905660857,0.0483573772292449,0.03663050772313249,0.0003773584905660857,0.0003773584905660857,0.0003773584905660857,0.0003773584905660857,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0

51095,1,"Actually 4 1/2 stars Do n't get me wrong this was a really good book . And I am so close to giving it 5 stars . It was just a little too short for me .

51111,1,"The Creation of the Underclass In this fascinating collection of essays , Dr. Dalrymple proposes a compelling thesis . Over the last twenty - five years a new type of underclass has emerged in western societies , an underclass that uses the welfare system in all its forms , subsidised housing , free by - weekly pay checks , child support and free medical benefits . From a liberal political standpoint , this support for the nation 's "" have nots "" is a compassionate gesture to take care of its own poor . One would logically assume that providing the poor with life 's essentials would bring the crime rate down and provide incentive for these people to further their standing in society . In fact , as Dalrymple proposes , it has had an opposite effect : crime in his native England has skyrocketed ; drug use is at an all time high and domestic violence is a wide spread common occurrence . Why ? Liberal values not economics has created individuals that deny any responsibility for their own lives , it is always the rich , the government or societies institutions that is to blame , thus crime continues to rise while England 's Welfare State has grown into an unwieldy Goliath . Dalrymple has worked in numerous countries and has been an attending physician and psychiatric consultant in London 's prisons for many years . Thus his thesis is not born from some abstract social theory about human behaviour . He has treated thousands of victims of domestic violence , consulted thousands of prisoners who have been incarcerated for petty crime to murder . The common thread that runs through all these cases is a pathological denial of responsibility for their own circumstances or conditions . As Dalrymple explains:""Like so many modern ills , the coarseness of spirit and behaviour grows out of ideas brewed up in the academy and among intellectuals - ideas that have seeped outward and are now having their practical effect on society . The relativism that has ruled the academy for many years has now come to rule the mind of the population . "" ( P.85)In other words , this post modern notion that there is no high and low art , no good and bad , no subtlety and crudeness , only relative perspectives ; taking this further , our behaviour too is not individually determined , but society and its oppressive inequalities that make me who I am , and a biological predisposition which causes me to steal from the old lady next door , beat my wife beyond recognition and consume drugs and alcohol like there is no tomorrow . The trickling down of these academic theories , biological determinism , Marxism and the post modern theory that there are no levels of hierarchical values , only difference , has created an underclass of victims who believe they should get something for nothing and commit crime because society has created them as victims as self - determinism does not exist . Dalrymple provides numerous real life examples from his practice working in a hospital in London . His writing style is straight forward , at times literary but never sentimental . The arguments in these essays are persuasive and push the reader to examine the underlying modern ideologies that have created and sustain a well provided for underclass of criminal "" victims "" .",577,1,0.00037037037037040505,0.00037037037037040505,0.1204836207813156,0.00037037037037040505,0.00037037037037040505,0.00037037037037040505,0.00037037037037040505,0.42856956682944863,0.00037037037037040505,0.00037037037037040505,0.00037037037037040505,0.00037037037037040505,0.00037037037037040505,0.00037037037037040505,0.00037037037037040505,0.00037037037037040505,0.03661999160892431,0.00037037037037040505,0.00037037037037040505,0.00037037037037040505,0.00037037037037040505,0.00037037037037040505,0.06774435938616447,0.017449465853347963,0.00037037037037040505,0.00037037037037040505,0.00037037037037040505,0.00037037037037040505,0.00037037037037040505,0.00037037037037040505,0.00037037037037040505,0.00037037037037040505,0.042135732030898446,0.00037037037037040505,0.00037037037037040505,0.0189051425635664,0.10380147754558701,0.00037037037037040505,0.00037037037037040505,0.00037037037037040505,0.13486398635559482,0.014611842230336094,0.00037037037037040505,0.00037037037037040505,0.00037037037037040505,0.00037037037037040505,0.00037037037037040505,0.00037037037037040505,0.00037037037037040505,0.00037037037037040505,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

51138,1,"An essential book for art lovers ! I was fortunate enough to have seen the now - legendary Vermeer exhibition at the National Gallery of Art in Washington , D.C. during the winter of 1995 - 96 . 21 out of the 35 ( or 36 ) extant paintings by Vermeer were included in the show , offering a unique opportunity to see the bulk of Vermeer 's amazing works in a single space , something that no one has experienced since 1696 , when @20 of his paintings were auctioned in Delft . Given the rarity and fragility of Vermeer 's works , it is unlikely that such an event will ever be repeated . All who were unable to make it to the show , however , have this splendid book as a document of this unique event . This book will remain the standard work on Vermeer for many decades , and represents the fruit of several years ' labor by art historians on two continents . Because so little is in fact known about Vermeer the man ( in truth , we have no idea at all what Vermeer 's education , interests , and personality were like ) , the catalogue essays fill this gap by contextualizing Vermeer 's work within the history of Dutch painting , the development of perspective , and the fascinating tale of Vermeer 's quot;rediscovery quot ; in the 19th century and his richly - deserved rise to worldwide fame . The essays and catalogue entries may be too technical for some readers , as the authors have expended a lot of effort to reconstruct Vermeer 's exact technique , something which can only be gleaned from careful study of the paintings themselves ( no drawings by Vermeer have survived , nor have any statements he may have made about painting ) . This extensive scholarly apparatus , while illuminating and occasionally even riveting ( the essay dealing with Vermeer 's rediscovery is a great detective narrative ! ) , tends to obscure the strange , even uncanny emotional charge that his images are suffused with . Vermeer 's personal world - so limited in content yet unforgettably haunting and evocative - is one of stillness and peace suffused with tension . Each image contains remarkable spatial and temporal ambiguities that make simple scenes like a lady writing a letter while her maid looks away or two people standing near a piano ( The Music Lesson ) vibrate with dramatic tension . Sadly , the somewhat passionless writing encases the pictures ( all of which are superbly reproduced ) in a rhetoric that does not address the fundamental issue : What is it about these paintings that is so powerful that their maker was rescued from total obscurity and has inspired poetry , novels and countless studies ? I was hoping to find some discussion of the psychological meaning of these images , but the traditional ( overly scholarly and dry ) art history within did nothing to help me understand my passion for the quot;Sphinx of Delft . quot ; That said , the book is a masterpiece of empirical research on the artist ( barring some new discovery , it is unlikely that we will ever have any more facts about Vermeer and his world than can be read here ) , exquisitely designed , and distinguished with beautiful reproductions . The volume is certainly one of the few bestsellers in the field of the art book - when I attended the show , the paperback print of the book was totally sold out and the hardcover was flying off the shelves ( it is odd that the book has not been reprinted in paperback ) . Johannes Vermeer is THE text to have on this artist and is unlikely to be superseded anytime soon . Immerse yourself in Vermeer 's world and you will be transformed . Seeing this exhibition changed my life , and I treasure this book as a means of recapturing the awe and joy that overwhelmed me at the time . I hope you will enjoy this book as much as I have",700,1,0.05241353575722687,0.00027397260273975333,0.00027397260273975333,0.00027397260273975333,0.06811153442890117,0.00027397260273975333,0.014715736080122369,0.1934622857557889,0.00027397260273975333,0.00027397260273975333,0.00027397260273975333,0.00027397260273975333,0.00027397260273975333,0.00027397260273975333,0.00027397260273975333,0.00027397260273975333,0.00027397260273975333,0.00027397260273975333,0.013972602739725575,0.00027397260273975333,0.00027397260273975333,0.00027397260273975333,0.00027397260273975333,0.00027397260273975333,0.00027397260273975333,0.00027397260273975333,0.00027397260273975333,0.00027397260273975333,0.009898659973445233,0.029615070574966876,0.00027397260273975333,0.00027397260273975333,0.00027397260273975333,0.00027397260273975333,0.00027397260273975333,0.00027397260273975333,0.2972138180375167,0.09074263710952403,0.00027397260273975333,0.00027397260273975333,0.10556484967783628,0.00027397260273975333,0.00027397260273975333,0.11360433835809579,0.00027397260273975333,0.00027397260273975333,0.00027397260273975333,0.00027397260273975333,0.00027397260273975333,0.00027397260273975333,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
51139,1,"Though - provoking treatise on human dependence on dogs In the "" New Work of Dogs,""author Jon Katz expands his scope from focusing on his relationship with his dogs --- a topic he has detailed in previous books --- to examining the canine - human relationship on a broader scale . Informed by arduous research ( a two foot stack of papers , books , journals ) , he sets out and succeeds in making a case that dogs , by - and - large , are doing different work from their traditional herding , hunting , and guarding . We have pushed our canines into new territory as emotional companions , therapy dogs , even extensions of our egos to help us cope with an increasingly complex world . The notion that we are growing increasingly isolated as a culture is not new , but seeing how humans are using dogs to cope with a society that no longer maintains the cultural bearings of "" the greatest generation "" is new ( at least to me).Mr . Katz visits with many dogs and their owners of various social economic strata who inhabit the enclaves of Montclair , New Jersey . More often than not , he found that dogs are being used as emotional surrogate , a classic situation noted in attachment theory but hitherto mostly applied to other people . Many of these dogs are pampered , untrained , and confused . Others are abused to some extent , whether through deliberate actions or through negligence . The stories are alarming and informing . I see many of the mistakes I made with previous dogs laid out before me and wonder if my two Australian shepherds are as well - adjusted as they seem . Many reviewers have commented , and correctly , that anyone planning to own a dog needs to read this book . Sadly , I think Mr. Katz will largely reach those people who already possess a great deal of knowledge about dogs --- those who train their dogs , who buy or adopt breeds suitable for their living conditions or schedules , and who treat their dogs with consistent , loving authority . Mr . Katz does not make harsh judgments on any of the circumstances he depicts but instead concludes by noting how many dogs are dumped in shelters where they languish or die . The numbers are staggering .

The book left me such respect for the depths that Ruth Reichl went through in order to dine as the everyday person would experience , especially in NYC 's "" best "" restaurants .

51171,1,"War and Peace : Both Inscrutable Reading WAR AND PEACE is an immense undertaking , which has less to do with page numbers and more to do with addressing some very fundamental questions about what it means to be human . The first time that I read it , I read it as a novel , for entertainment . Years later , I picked it up again but this time my task was more ambitious . I sought to know how Tolstoy could justify the ways of God to man . During this second reading , I was able to examine the Russian names , characters , events , and historical occurrences which occupied me the first time through . What I saw was that each of the hundreds of individuals was very much linked to the concluding Epilog , which I scanted then but studied now . Most readers of WAR AND PEACE find this part heavy going , which it certainly is , but in it , Tolstoy creates a key for unlocking the reasons who we are and why we do things the way we do . In essence , each human being is like an atom of gas floating in space , with one atom colliding at random with another , but when a sufficient number act in concert , such as Napoleon 's invasion of Russia , their force is irresistable . When Tolstoy introduces world leaders like Napoleon or the Tsar , he does so in such a way as to depict them as no more than one more free floating atom , who can not see the Big Picture any more clearly than anyone else can . The tragic decisions of these misguided leaders are based on a collective illusion that they and they alone can use divinely inspired reason to affect lasting change . But when human beings act as if they acknowledge that their powers of reason are both limited and self - deluding -- as when General Kutuzov relies on looking inward toward instinct rather than outward toward other circling and equally misguided atoms , then they are drawing closer to a universal "" one "" with nature . This "" one "" Tolstoy invests with religious overtones as synonymous with God . Tolstoy does not say that human beings are preprogrammed robots held in thrall by that "" one "" or any other deity , but he does say that history , time , and man are all part of a universal flow that swoops along all in its path , and that if any intelligent atom wishes to know which way the flow is likely to go , then he might wish to emulate General Kutuzov , who at least knows that humbleness in the face of chaos is the first step in finding a rational basis for who we are and where we are going .",489,1,0.0003174603174603399,0.0003174603174603399,0.0003174603174603399,0.0003174603174603399,0.019458141284270234,0.0003174603174603399,0.0003174603174603399,0.3873474216085915,0.0003174603174603399,0.0003174603174603399,0.0003174603174603399,0.0003174603174603399,0.0003174603174603399,0.0003174603174603399,0.0003174603174603399,0.0003174603174603399,0.0003174603174603399,0.0003174603174603399,0.0003174603174603399,0.0003174603174603399,0.0003174603174603399,0.0003174603174603399,0.0003174603174603399,0.0003174603174603399,0.0003174603174603399,0.0003174603174603399,0.019865987956869967,0.0003174603174603399,0.0003174603174603399,0.05037975952132707,0.0003174603174603399,0.06876961859874232,0.0003174603174603399,0.0003174603174603399,0.0003174603174603399,0.0003174603174603399,0.2200148125939649,0.0003174603174603399,0.0003174603174603399,0.05736667261387219,0.026727570368684103,0.0003174603174603399,0.0003174603174603399,0.0003174603174603399,0.13705414243780364,0.0003174603174603399,0.0003174603174603399,0.0003174603174603399,0.0003174603174603399,0.0003174603174603399,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0
51174,1,"Layered plot with plenty of twists and turns ... It 's been awhile since I had a really good crime mystery read . Therefore , I was excited when The Cold Moon by Jeffery Deaver arrived at the library . The latest Lincoln Rhyme novel delivered just what I was looking for ... twists , turns , and plenty of forensic work . The plotline here starts out on two tracks . A killer nicknamed The Watchmaker is murdering people using slow torture techniques . His signature is leaving a particular clock style at the scene . Rhyme and Amelia Sachs , his partner , are put on the case in order to solve it before more people die . Sachs is also running her own case involving an apparent suicide that really turns out to be a murder . The murder points to a run - down bar where a group of cops meet on a regular basis . There 's a strong chance that the cops are corrupt , so Sachs has to step carefully as it 's not clear who she can trust . The two cases converge when The Watchmaker is captured but the reality of his killings turn out to be a carefully staged plan to expose the corruption that Sachs is investigating . But the layering of deception goes even deeper than that , and Rhyme has to continue to dig through each apparent motive and story to finally get to the core truth behind The Watchmaker ... If you want plot twists and turns , this book will definitely satisfy . There are a number of scenes that appear to be transpiring in one fashion , only to be something else entirely . The layering of plots by the killer never seems to end , and each new revelation ends up being the start of a new level of distraction . A couple of the twists seemed to be a bit over the top , but not so much as to put me off the story . It 's a book I really did n't want to put down , even though I had other things I should be doing ..",368,1,0.2873090109693948,0.0003846153846154122,0.0003846153846154122,0.0003846153846154122,0.0003846153846154122,0.0003846153846154122,0.0003846153846154122,0.0003846153846154122,0.0003846153846154122,0.0003846153846154122,0.0003846153846154122,0.0003846153846154122,0.0003846153846154122,0.0003846153846154122,0.019615384615383206,0.0003846153846154122,0.0003846153846154122,0.0003846153846154122,0.0003846153846154122,0.0003846153846154122,0.0003846153846154122,0.28619263128264577,0.0003846153846154122,0.0003846153846154122,0.0003846153846154122,0.0003846153846154122,0.0003846153846154122,0.0003846153846154122,0.0003846153846154122,0.0003846153846154122,0.0003846153846154122,0.0003846153846154122,0.0003846153846154122,0.0003846153846154122,0.0003846153846154122,0.0003846153846154122,0.11180878597744383,0.0003846153846154122,0.07073365985438647,0.0003846153846154122,0.0003846153846154122,0.0003846153846154122,0.0003846153846154122,0.0003846153846154122,0.0003846153846154122,0.1883200784546983,0.019481987307584856,0.0003846153846154122,0.0003846153846154122,0.0003846153846154122,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0

51215,1,"Yes , Stephen King really IS that good We see a phrase a lot when we visit how - to sites for writers . World building . By this , we mean the setting , the characters , and everything else where our story will occur . For me , this often means maps , memories and visits , since I write about where I live . But if you 'd like to see exactly what "" world building "" means , head down to your local library and grab SALEM 'S LOT by Stephen King . Yeah , that 's right , I 'm reviewing a book by Stephen King . As if his career really needs my help . ( I bought my copy at Foreign Language Bookstore on Yanan Lu in Hangzhou , with a new introduction that is a pleasure to read , but I mentioned the library to save you some money . ) When Stephen King mania first gripped the English - speaking world , I missed it . I saw the film of CARRIE and hated it . Years later , at a guard desk on a long shift , scheduled so suddenly that I had n't had a chance to visit the library , I read what was in the desk instead . THINNER . If I were Stephen King , I 'd have put a pen name on that crap as well . One of King 's fans brought me around . She recommended THE SHINING . Of course I thought of that Kubrick / Nicholson travesty . No no , she said , read the book . It 's much different . Yes , it is . It 's fantastic for its perceptiveness . Next up , PET SEMATARY , which scared the crap out of me . And that , my friends , is not easy . ON WRITING . I 've gushed about that enough times . The films STAND BY ME and THE APT PUPIL . So , in the end , I appreciate King and forgive him for CARRIE , and I think he 's forgiven himself . We wo n't talk about the Richard Bachman alias , although the film of THE RUNNING MAN was fun in a stupid sort of way . SALEM 'S LOT . King 's second book , and perhaps it should have been his first . I 've been in China since 1999 . If I ever want to visit a town in the US , I do n't need a plane ticket . I can just real SALEM 'S LOT . Consider it a clinic on world building . These are the places and the people I left behind , right there , recorded by a master . Well , except for the vampire . I do n't recall seeing him in Watha . Maybe he moved into my old house . Actually , that 's Stephen King right there . He creates an entirely real world , then throws in something unusual because it makes the story move and because he just thinks it 's cool . A vampire here , a rabid dog there , a mind reader over there , a UFO crashing into Hickville ... Nobody has defended Stephen King by mentioning that William Shakespeare trucked heavily with ghosts and witches and prophesies in his stories , so I 'll limit myself to a single sentence . I believe that , just as I studied Mary Shelley 's FRANKENSTEIN in a Literature class , one day students will study Stephen King . Just nothing about cars that come to life , because those stories really suck . I will accuse Stephen King of being uneven , and he explains why in ON WRITING . But at his best , I recommend him highly . Oh , and here 's a weird bit of trivia . I recognized the scene on page 50 . Nothing before it , nothing after it , just that one bit . So I at least began reading this book . Probably at a guard desk . Tampa , Florida , has excellent libraries . At my guard desk , when I was n't writing , I was getting drunk on literature , and I ca n't possibly remember it all . But I think SALEM 'S LOT by Stephen King plus THE THANATOS SYNDROME by Walker Percy spurred me to write THE DEMONS WITHIN , which I later threw out but which gave DESCENT INTO MADNESS its back story . ( For Madman trivia buffs : Terrence and Sandra Howell once had their own novel . It really sucked . Terrence had his own novel 15 years before that . It also sucked . He 's a composite of two classmates , Terrence Cram and Ricky Howell , so I 'm glad he finally showed up in some form . ) In ON WRITING , Stephen King tells us that he was so drunk and stoned at one point that he ca n't remember writing some of his books . It seems I was so high on literature at one point that I forgot entire books I read , including SALEM 'S LOT . So , I guess that getting old does have its advantages .",896,1,0.23612353876077594,0.00013157894736843734,0.00013157894736843734,0.00013157894736843734,0.00013157894736843734,0.00013157894736843734,0.006909259905533416,0.0288904176048931,0.00013157894736843734,0.00013157894736843734,0.00013157894736843734,0.017624843645035974,0.16037185090763129,0.00013157894736843734,0.006710526315787472,0.00013157894736843734,0.00013157894736843734,0.009450792687426563,0.00013157894736843734,0.008444736677641417,0.00013157894736843734,0.00013157894736843734,0.00013157894736843734,0.016947138183342116,0.007174987396958746,0.00013157894736843734,0.019703212444817486,0.00013157894736843734,0.00013157894736843734,0.008773601026830297,0.00013157894736843734,0.00013157894736843734,0.021371817926265607,0.00013157894736843734,0.034110705904052276,0.00013157894736843734,0.23496631999191303,0.013844863657283206,0.00965942628894483,0.024086811910843123,0.07412445634287201,0.00013157894736843734,0.00013157894736843734,0.0567633240000989,0.00013157894736843734,0.00013157894736843734,0.00013157894736843734,0.00013157894736843734,0.00013157894736843734,0.00013157894736843734,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

Anyway , there are others who have diagramed the story , I just wanted to say , I enjoyed it and the way it was presented in audio version .",136,1,0.0906747552866761,0.0006451612903226226,0.032931954568286965,0.0006451612903226226,0.0006451612903226226,0.03254583064817817,0.08340266823479624,0.0006451612903226226,0.03520342628654992,0.0006451612903226226,0.0006451612903226226,0.0006451612903226226,0.0006451612903226226,0.0006451612903226226,0.0006451612903226226,0.0006451612903226226,0.0006451612903226226,0.0006451612903226226,0.0006451612903226226,0.0006451612903226226,0.0006451612903226226,0.04323838646840768,0.0006451612903226226,0.0006451612903226226,0.0006451612903226226,0.0006451612903226226,0.0006451612903226226,0.0006451612903226226,0.06779482831908633,0.0006451612903226226,0.0006451612903226226,0.0006451612903226226,0.0006451612903226226,0.0006451612903226226,0.11288023673774712,0.0006451612903226226,0.3833602849495878,0.0006451612903226226,0.09216117688777888,0.0006451612903226226,0.0006451612903226226,0.0006451612903226226,0.0006451612903226226,0.0006451612903226226,0.0006451612903226226,0.0006451612903226226,0.0006451612903226226,0.0006451612903226226,0.0006451612903226226,0.0006451612903226226,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

51262,1,"A perfect "" Whodunnit "" ... The twist here is that the reader knows while the characters do not . In a matter of minutes , nine people 's fates are determined by three men sitting in a jail cell . Simply playing a "" game "" to pass the time , each man names three people he 'd like to see killed . When the first man is released , three people become a target as he follows through with the game . The first in a trilogy , Dead Wrong gets it dead right . Mara Douglas is on one of the men 's list , and it 's up to Aidan Shields to protect her . While the book is decidedly light on the traditional sex part of a romantic suspense , it is implied . I liked both characters , and Aidan avoids being the atypical surly alpha male with surprising charm and affection . I ca n't wait for Dead Certain , which follows the second man as he is released from jail and takes up the gauntlet thrown down by the first man . I got this one from the library , but I certainly will buy the next two",206,1,0.000526315789473733,0.000526315789473733,0.000526315789473733,0.000526315789473733,0.000526315789473733,0.000526315789473733,0.000526315789473733,0.37725821166382467,0.000526315789473733,0.000526315789473733,0.000526315789473733,0.000526315789473733,0.000526315789473733,0.000526315789473733,0.000526315789473733,0.000526315789473733,0.16413020774055745,0.03355180381053608,0.026841929569064428,0.000526315789473733,0.000526315789473733,0.04134891342090413,0.000526315789473733,0.000526315789473733,0.000526315789473733,0.000526315789473733,0.000526315789473733,0.000526315789473733,0.000526315789473733,0.000526315789473733,0.000526315789473733,0.000526315789473733,0.000526315789473733,0.000526315789473733,0.09383026013251532,0.024654832103728,0.09298953304207773,0.000526315789473733,0.000526315789473733,0.000526315789473733,0.000526315789473733,0.000526315789473733,0.000526315789473733,0.000526315789473733,0.000526315789473733,0.000526315789473733,0.1238153611483691,0.000526315789473733,0.000526315789473733,0.000526315789473733,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
51267,1,"Introduces some interesting concepts and explanations The author , James Surowiecki , lays out and explores a variety of general and specific cases of groups of people acting either wisely or stupidly . The examples are all easy to relate to , and I found them to raise meaningful questions in my mind which were answered in due course in the text . When I think of crowds , I think of unthinking masses moving together , led by tradition , habit , or an individual . How can that be wise ? A more accurate title would be "" How some groups of people can make better decisions than experts , while others act like collective idiots , and what characteristics distinguish the two types of groups "" , although that 's hardly likely to sell as many copies . :-) For me this really shed some light on my past experiences of participating in successful and unsuccessful teams at work . I 'd sometimes wondered why I 've been on a few teams that appeared to "" click "" ( smart people who want to work together to achieve a common goal ) , but our results were n't great , whereas other teams have been successful . What was it that made a good team ? I had some of the pieces , felt I still had some real gaps in my knowledge . This book certainly helped . To paraphrase the basic idea that I took away from the book , teams of people can achieve superior results if:1 Each individual on the team is well informed ; 2 The work of one individual does not influence the work of another ; 3 There is an objective method to aggregate individual conclusions into a group conclusion . As simple as they sound , there are many ways to fail , and the book does a great job of exploring a variety of phenomena that cause failure .",331,1,0.13395456273963469,0.0004651162790697975,0.0004651162790697975,0.0004651162790697975,0.05389518745139169,0.02316115060077658,0.0004651162790697975,0.19759024667068315,0.0004651162790697975,0.0004651162790697975,0.0004651162790697975,0.0004651162790697975,0.0004651162790697975,0.0004651162790697975,0.0004651162790697975,0.0004651162790697975,0.07435653758337407,0.0004651162790697975,0.0004651162790697975,0.0004651162790697975,0.0004651162790697975,0.06156324819480231,0.0004651162790697975,0.0004651162790697975,0.0004651162790697975,0.0004651162790697975,0.0004651162790697975,0.0004651162790697975,0.026892557056578587,0.0004651162790697975,0.0004651162790697975,0.0004651162790697975,0.0004651162790697975,0.0004651162790697975,0.0004651162790697975,0.0004651162790697975,0.20273079886947842,0.0004651162790697975,0.08365131738972613,0.0004651162790697975,0.0004651162790697975,0.0004651162790697975,0.0004651162790697975,0.0004651162790697975,0.12359974228076236,0.0004651162790697975,0.0004651162790697975,0.0004651162790697975,0.0004651162790697975,0.0004651162790697975,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

51275,1,"A Classic This is a book about beauty , passion , a longing for the thing that a true artist or lover of the arts , especially music , craves and feels , the fire that burns within . A book that dares to take one , if one dares to take that step , on a journey deep into the bare souls of it 's characters . The story that unfolds is not a story that has a specific plot , or develops into dramatic changes for the characters . That is not what the author wanted to convey , and one should approach this book as one would a tale of a little piece of humanity , and not expect the characters to travel actively without . The book gives us these people , the town , the surroundings . It brings us deep into the realities , the thoughts , the complexities of the human soul . The people are good , bad , ugly , beautiful , selfish , depressed , found , or lost . But from the moment the reader of this book feels the passion for music in Mick Kelly 's soul , and her yearning to soar above the squalor and desperation of the small town , then the author reveals her own soul with her words , for those that pick up on what her words show . I am still amazed at the power this book has . Any other readers here who have written that they failed to understand why one should bother reading this book , should perhaps make due with fast moving action books or glossy novels about the rich and famous .

51296,1,"How do you want to interpret consciousness ? Until very recently the subject of animal awareness has not even been approached with the correct questions . As Rogers clearly points out , most of the research on cognition has been directed at supporting the assumption that consciousness is an exclusively human phenomenon . An inherited predisposition to preserve a human monopoly on consciousness survives only because it appeases our omnivorous behaviors . In the early 1600 's Spinoza correctly determined the existence of an emotional balance . He told us that one extreme emotion will dominate the senses until such time that an equally extreme opposite emotion brings us back to emotional center . Antonio Damasio provides a compelling case that consciousness is inextricably linked to emotion in his book "" The Feeling of What Happens : Body and Emotion in the Making of Consciousness "" . Using Damasio and Spinoza as a frame of reference it follows that each and every decision we make is based on an emotion , not a uniquely quantifiable language infused thought , as the popular human interpretation might assume . Examples of this might be choosing the color of paint , a selection from a menu , the selection of a mate or which way to turn when unsure . Animals have provided us with an exhaustive and document able list of emotional behaviors . How is it possible to arrive at the conclusion that animals are not conscious when most animals will clearly display behaviors consistent with emotional stimulus ? The last frontier of computer science is the quest for a conscious , non - human entity . Ray Kurzweil has spent the better part of his life predicting the emergence of an exponentially accelerating form of machine augmented human consciousness . In my view , it would be safer to assume that at some point technology will provide us with means to understand the different levels of consciousness that exist . While computers struggle to redefine consciousness by passing "" Turing Tests "" , visionary ethologists might find ways to interpret the world through different eyes . It is exceedingly difficult to discuss the subject of animal consciousness from the point of view of the animal and avoid emotional interpretations . Lesley Rogers has given us a glimpse of this vast subject by asking the correct questions and , providing the current objective answers from each available vantage point . At a disciplined two hundred pages the book stands out as a concise introduction to the subject of Animal Cognition .",430,1,0.00043478260869569805,0.00043478260869569805,0.00043478260869569805,0.00043478260869569805,0.024038307731919194,0.00043478260869569805,0.022175631384332182,0.3179274229116828,0.022915788246223003,0.00043478260869569805,0.00043478260869569805,0.00043478260869569805,0.00043478260869569805,0.00043478260869569805,0.00043478260869569805,0.00043478260869569805,0.00043478260869569805,0.00043478260869569805,0.00043478260869569805,0.00043478260869569805,0.00043478260869569805,0.00043478260869569805,0.00043478260869569805,0.00043478260869569805,0.00043478260869569805,0.00043478260869569805,0.00043478260869569805,0.00043478260869569805,0.00043478260869569805,0.00043478260869569805,0.00043478260869569805,0.00043478260869569805,0.00043478260869569805,0.00043478260869569805,0.00043478260869569805,0.00043478260869569805,0.1963756926097105,0.02217391319189439,0.06459580227653833,0.04441851703698415,0.00043478260869569805,0.00043478260869569805,0.00043478260869569805,0.00043478260869569805,0.07510882740584177,0.1665695861280218,0.0267439893377196,0.00043478260869569805,0.00043478260869569805,0.00043478260869569805,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0
51304,1,"Swarm theory The new economy is a global economy favoring intangible things : ideas , information , and relationships and is intensely interlinked . Today , the new information based sector occupies over 15 % of the total US economy . In the postindustrial society , communication has become the economy and the cultural , technological , and conceptual impacts reverberate at the roots of our lives . The financial sector has reshaped the economy ; the financial sector ownership involves only a small number of people ; the financial innovations include : mortgages , insurance , venture funding , stocks , checks , credit cards , and mutual funds ; the financial sector has given rise to corporations , market capitalism , the industrial age , and has influenced how all business has been done . Since communication is the economy , the net is the future . The net has accelerated in usage due to the increase in silicon chips and fiber optic data transmission ; the net is weaving lives , minds , and artifacts into a global scale network ; the result is the swarm of information , reticulating the surface of the planet ; the new economy will increasing obey the logic of the networks and understanding the network will be the key to understanding how the economy works . In 1997 , there were 6 billion non - computer chips and by 2005 the predicted usage was at 10 billion . The network represents connectivity . We are connection everything to everything . The network values the dumb power of bits in the swarm ; the connectivity and usage of the dumb bits or parts in the swarm yield smart results ; and we do n't need advanced Artificial Intelligence to make an intelligent system . The network is a link of distributed , bottom up , data bits ; it lets things communicate among themselves and takes a decentralized approach for communication , for example , manufacturing robots scheduling their own work based on incoming requests , as they bid on work dependant on their capability . The swarm aim is superior performance in a turbulent environment . Consider the power of the "" Wisdom of the crowds "" . In one case sample , 5,000 attendees , at a computer graphics conference were give individual access to a simulator and the task on how too land a plane . The attendee had novice knowledge about how to land the plane . The jet responded to the average decisions of the swarm . The group landed the jet with almost no direction . In another case example , the group was given the task to navigate a submarine and go look for buried treasure . The group could not initiate any movement until leadership from a loud speaker was given to "" go right "" . The leadership unlocked the paralysis of the swarm and the direction facilitated action . Technology success is measured on how invisible it becomes to the end user and how effective it becomes to the long term strategy in developing products and services that ca n't be ignored . The power of the network increases in value n power 2 where n is the number of members . Therefore , networks need to increase their critical mass of members to become effective . Innovation attracts members . Innovation is more important than price ; price is the derivative of innovation ; monopolies push up price and decrease quality and create a dangerous singular source of innovation ; and the network destroys monopolies through collective innovation , such as , open source .",614,1,0.00034482758620692737,0.00034482758620695626,0.03634230608949166,0.018583359077830444,0.00034482758620692737,0.00034482758620692737,0.04144891394201367,0.00034482758620692737,0.00034482758620692737,0.00034482758620692737,0.00034482758620692737,0.00034482758620692737,0.00034482758620692737,0.00034482758620692737,0.00034482758620692737,0.00034482758620692737,0.00034482758620692737,0.00034482758620692737,0.00034482758620692737,0.00034482758620692737,0.00034482758620692737,0.02079578140187167,0.041637258822130145,0.00034482758620692737,0.02217840110154291,0.00034482758620692737,0.00034482758620692737,0.00034482758620692737,0.00034482758620692737,0.00034482758620692737,0.00034482758620692737,0.00034482758620692737,0.00034482758620692737,0.00034482758620692737,0.08829814150599345,0.00034482758620692737,0.00034482758620692737,0.00034482758620692737,0.00034482758620692737,0.00034482758620692737,0.09056981003498857,0.07556017325249581,0.00034482758620692737,0.00034482758620692737,0.024886635061464563,0.5262509438481068,0.00034482758620692737,0.00034482758620692737,0.00034482758620692737,0.00034482758620692737,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0

51317,1,"Confusing , Hilarious , Profound Lost in the Funhouse can be a very bewildering and irritating collection if you are n't in the right mood for it . If you are n't well - versed in post - modern fiction ( barthelme , calvino , etc are good reference points ) you might want to start somewhere else first . Even Barth 's novels are more immediately digestible . With that said , though , this collection does n't really operate on one consistent level . Perhaps this is because many of these stories were written by Barth much earlier in his career . The three stories concerning Ambrose 's birth and development are very straightforward and enjoyable on a surface level until the whole series goes flying into left - field with the titular "" Lost in the Funhouse "" story ( which Barth is probably most known for ) . From that point on , most of the stories are more about the process of writing and the relationship between the reader , writer , and the characters . Stories like "" Title "" and "" Life - Story "" work more as essays on the nature of fiction than actual works of fiction , and were ( for me at least ) a little tedious . The best moments occur when Barth combines his thoughful analysis on the nature of writing and art with a really good ground - situation , typically based on Greek mythology . The best of these are the utterly raunchy "" Petitition "" and the labyrinthine "" Menelaiad"" . Taken as a whole , though , Lost in the Funhouse is greatly satisfying , even if ( like me ) you really only understood about 20 % of what Barth was talking about on your first read - through . It 's the sort of book I 'll go back to again and again to try and delve deeper into the mystery of the funhouse while appreciating all over the hilarious bawdy humor . Oh , and make sure to read Barth 's seven additional notes at the front of the book ( though maybe only after you 've read the story that is being discussed in each note , so as not to ruin the initial experience)-- they really help to clarify some of Barth 's intentions . I ca n't even imagine appreciating a story like "" Glossolalia "" without having read the note concerning it",416,1,0.15980251009551347,0.00027027027027029776,0.00027027027027029776,0.00027027027027029776,0.00027027027027029776,0.00027027027027029776,0.00027027027027029776,0.00027027027027029776,0.00027027027027029776,0.00027027027027029776,0.00027027027027029776,0.00027027027027029776,0.1414116239959658,0.00027027027027029776,0.00027027027027029776,0.00027027027027029776,0.00027027027027029776,0.00027027027027029776,0.01378378378378334,0.00027027027027029776,0.00027027027027029776,0.00027027027027029776,0.00027027027027029776,0.015378656918516571,0.00027027027027029776,0.00027027027027029776,0.00027027027027029776,0.00027027027027029776,0.00027027027027029776,0.015039580197249759,0.00027027027027029776,0.00027027027027029776,0.00027027027027029776,0.00027027027027029776,0.11293012847351529,0.04464698298093918,0.35705318573475425,0.00027027027027029776,0.026297206292841626,0.00027027027027029776,0.06337947971428365,0.00027027027027029776,0.00027027027027029776,0.03973632127209552,0.00027027027027029776,0.00027027027027029776,0.00027027027027029776,0.00027027027027029776,0.00027027027027029776,0.00027027027027029776,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

51329,1,"The Great Communicator Peggy Noonan 's Reagan has the texture of truth , unlike a recent Reagan bio by Richard Reeves that has the texture of slime . Noonan 's Reagan is not hagiography ; it 's clear - eyed , clean , and palpably honest . I feel Ms. Noonan 's honesty just as I felt the incredible lightness of Reeves ' shallowness . Noonan wrote her story of a great man and the building of his character as Ronald Reagan lay dying . Now that he 's gone , Peggy Noonan is our era 's great communicator . Not every word of When Character Was King is the utterly necessary word at the absolutely necessary time -- a few of her words do n't fit and an occasional fact is flubbed -- but all other words of hundreds and thousands fit perfectly into the best portrait we have of a good and great man , a description also used fittingly for Dwight Eisenhower . Noonan , I believe , is the only biographer of President Reagan who understands the import of a first - term footnote , an episode that most of the world has learned to forget or , like Reeves , has learned to diminish . That 's the PATCO strike which , as Noonan shows , had world - historical implications . By the force of his focus , President Reagan used PATCO to reassert free - world mastery in our twilight struggle with an Evil Empire that was evil and that was an empire .

51378,1,"Simply fantastic ! I got my copy of quot;The Five Keys to Value Investing quot ; as a graduation gift from my dad who is a longtime professional equities investor . He thought this book would be a good way for me to prep before I start my career on Wall Street . I was not disappointed . The Five Keys is a very good summary of what I learned in business school and much , much more . The author draws heavily from his own professional experiences as a disciple of one legendary value investor and couples it with the value investment styles of other great investors like Buffett and Graham . The experience that the reader is drawn into is very worthwhile ; but what makes this book very special is the framework . I have read several investment books over the years , but none like this one . Putting thousands of lessons and teachings of prominent value investors into a solid frame of mind is clearly the draw . In addition , reading along as the author analyzes and dissects companies and few special situations add gravitas to the body of work . The clarity in the concepts and the "" conversation - like "" tone was particularly attractive to me . In sum , this is a very coherent , practical book on the principles of value investing despite the fact that it is not too objective -- considering the authors ' strong unapologetic bias towards value investing",253,1,0.2878579218718483,0.00042553191489364765,0.00042553191489364765,0.00042553191489364765,0.00042553191489364765,0.00042553191489364765,0.058855447678477925,0.00042553191489364765,0.00042553191489364765,0.00042553191489364765,0.00042553191489364765,0.00042553191489364765,0.00042553191489364765,0.00042553191489364765,0.00042553191489364765,0.00042553191489364765,0.00042553191489364765,0.00042553191489364765,0.00042553191489364765,0.00042553191489364765,0.00042553191489364765,0.00042553191489364765,0.00042553191489364765,0.00042553191489364765,0.038814296449195866,0.0256945888813006,0.00042553191489364765,0.00042553191489364765,0.00042553191489364765,0.00042553191489364765,0.00042553191489364765,0.00042553191489364765,0.00042553191489364765,0.00042553191489364765,0.15871183974570385,0.00042553191489364765,0.34390769037024443,0.043907759162911265,0.00042553191489364765,0.00042553191489364765,0.024378115414784393,0.00042553191489364765,0.00042553191489364765,0.00042553191489364765,0.00042553191489364765,0.00042553191489364765,0.00042553191489364765,0.00042553191489364765,0.00042553191489364765,0.00042553191489364765,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

' The Regulators ' is not quite on the literary level of ' Desperation , ' but that makes it more fun in a way , especially as it 's less preachy .

Here we see a more terribly playful , oddly fastidious , and possibly younger Tak who loves spaghetti , chocolate milk , westerns , and Cassie Stiles .

51422,1,"A Wealth of History and Opinion This book offers such a fabulous collection of ideas . The information and ideas one can gather from these pages is both a great way to trace the roots of feminism as well as to decide where we go from here . Each section and piece has introductory information giving a setting of time , place and situation before the writers present their views . There are so many ideas , ideals and beliefs that while not always agreeable or congruent , can be applied to today 's feminist movement .

51424,1,""" To have committed no fault , yet to be so entirely alone ... "" NICHOLAS NICKLEBY is a significant Dickens in the uncannily absorbing way the narrative diversifies to various literary discourses . The protagonist 's experiences and encounters in adverse milieu through life not only embody melodrama , comic relief , political satire , class comedy , social criticism , and domestic farce , they allow Dickens the opportunity to portray , to the minutest nuance , an extraordinary cast of rogues and eccentrics . The main frame of NICHOLAS NICKLEBY is a quintessential Dickens : a generic , virtuous man who concerns with the affair of establishing his identity as a gentleman and the pruning of whom entwines him in a checkered fate . Nicholas Nickleby has committed no fault and offenses , and yet he is to be entirely alone in the world , to be separated from the people he loves , and to be proscribed like a criminal . The more unbearable the ordeals and the more injudicious the deal of the hand from life , the more profusely the novel accentuates Dickens ' outrage at the cruelty and social injustice . When Nicholas Nickleby is left exiguous after his father 's death , he turns to his hard - hearted uncle to solicit succor . But Ralph Nickleby , a most unscrupulous and avarious man he is , demonstrates that he is proof against all appeals of blood and kindred , and is steeled against every tale of distress and sorrows . The man will never fail to exert any resolution or cunning that will promise increase of money for there is scarcely anything he will not have hazarded to gratify his greed . It 's not that he is unconscious of the baseness of the means with which he acquires his gains . He cares only for gratification of his passions of avarice and hatred . He might have from the beginning conceived dislike to his nephew whom he brazenly places in Squeers ' Dotheboys Hall , a school for unwanted boys , as an assistant master . The cruelty of Squeers , who 's coarse and ruffian behavior even at his best temper , Nicholas has been an unwilling witness . The filthy condition of the school and the bodily distortion of the boys impart in him a dismal feeling . The thought of being a helper and abettor of such squalid practice fills his with honest disgust and indignation . The cruelties descend upon helpless infancy fuel this rightful indignation in Nicholas , who interferes with the schoolmaster 's flogging a boy named Smike and astonishes everyone in school . Not only does Ralph persuade Nicholas ' family to renounce him for the atrocities to Squeers of which he is guilty , he also betrays his niece Kate into the company of some libertine men who are clients of his and who speak of her in a most casual , lecherous , ribald and vulgar terms . She is roused beyond all endurance by a profusion of compliments of which coarseness becomes humor and of which vulgarity softens down to the most charming eccentricity . The mutual hatred between uncle and nephew aggravates as Nicholas overhears conversations about his sister . The hidden feud further percolates to the surface and leads to a pitch to its malignity as he tries to rescue a girl from a marriage to which she has been impelled . As the uncle insidiously hatches a scheme to retaliate against his nephew who has in every step of the way interceded and thwarted his plans for mercenary gains , Nicholas entwines with a cast of characters who are humorous , memorable , and true to life . Peripheral to his molding to become a gentleman are episodes of political satire , theatrical success , courtship , family farce , and chicanery . The most significant character is no doubt Smike , whom Nicholas saves from the hellish grip of the schoolmaster and has become his best friend . Nicholas ' unfailing love and protectiveness toward the boy accentuates his being the novel 's hero , whose domestic virtues , affections , compassion , and delicacy of feelings qualifies him to his later fortune and does him justice . NICHOLAS NICKLEBY is a flamboyantly exuberant work in which Dickens wreaks the tension of his social satire to a pitch . Details on the Yorkshire school offer such magnifying vision of the cruelty , filthiness , and despotism in the boarding schools . Nor does he spare the rogues and the greedy , whose squeamishness he sarcastically embellishes as a common honesty and whose pride as self - respect . NICHOLAS NICKLEBY also evokes the subtle problem of human nature in establishing boundary of one 's remorse . Although Ralph might feel no remorse in his betraying his niece to the temptation of his libertine clients , he hates them for doing what he has expected them to do . In a sense , Nicholas is seen as the unswerving force that is determined to right the wrong of the society . He tries to appeal to the compassion and humanity of those who have gone astray and to lead them to consider the innocent and the helpless . Nicholas might embody energy for radicalism and ambition to challenge social injustice ; his ultimate goal is the recovery of his ancestral position in the social hierarchy . But in the effort to undertake the good deeds , he is influenced by no selfish or personal consideration but by pity for the people he helps and detestation and abhorrence of the heartless schemes . In the same way he is determined to appeal to his uncle 's humanity and not to wreak revenge on him . But Ralph 's hatred for his nephew has been fed upon his own defeat , nourished on his interference with all his schemes . NICHOLAS NICKLEBY is a sober social commentary woven with social and domestic issues . Woven in one man 's aspiration to restore family 's ancestral dignity is Dickens ' own musing , monologues , teachings on the soul , the life , and the moral . The discourse at times assumes a voice of despondency , sobriety and indignation .",1061,1,0.0002666666666666973,0.0002666666666666973,0.0002666666666666973,0.0002666666666666973,0.0002666666666666973,0.0002666666666666973,0.0002666666666666973,0.3392730153102269,0.0002666666666666973,0.0002666666666666973,0.0002666666666666973,0.0002666666666666973,0.0002666666666666973,0.0002666666666666973,0.0002666666666666973,0.0002666666666666973,0.0621030088982758,0.0002666666666666973,0.0002666666666666973,0.0002666666666666973,0.24690583540654143,0.0002666666666666973,0.01630999056128878,0.0002666666666666973,0.03127155807809924,0.06281292903758404,0.017135785840318368,0.0002666666666666973,0.0002666666666666973,0.02277078504765883,0.0002666666666666973,0.0002666666666666973,0.0002666666666666973,0.0002666666666666973,0.0002666666666666973,0.0002666666666666973,0.08138694093437447,0.0002666666666666973,0.0002666666666666973,0.01505161107843704,0.0002666666666666973,0.013885341493566714,0.0002666666666666973,0.0002666666666666973,0.0002666666666666973,0.08095986498029412,0.0002666666666666973,0.0002666666666666973,0.0002666666666666973,0.0002666666666666973,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
51430,1,"Provides Great Insights Into Life The reader that keeps with this book will be rewarded . The conversations in the book are intelligent , the characters and dialogue are real , and the descriptions and settings are vivid . While the author provides a lengthy disclaimer at the end of the book explaining how the fictional university and town in the book are not based upon Yale and New Haven , it is sometimes hard to believe , especially given that the author has been a faculty member at Yale Law School for over twenty - years . This is not to say , however , that the descriptions in the book of the law school and town are inaccurate . Rather , they may provide quite an accurate description of a town torn between those affiliated with a prestigious university ( Yale ) and those that are not . In short , I enjoyed this book because it kept me guessing and the pace was just right . This is not a read - it - in - one - day thriller that Grisham might come up with . Instead , this is a much more intellectual read . What I enjoyed most about the book are its insights into life itself . Carter uses fictional characters to explore the good and bad sides to marriage and family life , careers , law , and racism in this country . If you are willing to keep reading when the story seems slow and to learn and grow with the characters ( especially Talcott ) , believe me , this book will reward you , and you 'll be glad you read it",283,1,0.00035714285714288273,0.05755448834793958,0.00035714285714288273,0.00035714285714288273,0.00035714285714288273,0.00035714285714288273,0.00035714285714288273,0.00035714285714288273,0.00035714285714288273,0.00035714285714288273,0.00035714285714288273,0.00035714285714288273,0.00035714285714288273,0.00035714285714288273,0.00035714285714288273,0.00035714285714288273,0.00035714285714288273,0.00035714285714288273,0.00035714285714288273,0.00035714285714288273,0.00035714285714288273,0.06924371961265752,0.00035714285714288273,0.00035714285714288273,0.00035714285714288273,0.06837208238638974,0.00035714285714288273,0.00035714285714288273,0.00035714285714288273,0.00035714285714288273,0.00035714285714288273,0.00035714285714288273,0.06735205749376778,0.00035714285714288273,0.10987393574818831,0.00035714285714288273,0.5879575777160069,0.00035714285714288273,0.00035714285714288273,0.00035714285714288273,0.024288995837906138,0.00035714285714288273,0.00035714285714288273,0.00035714285714288273,0.00035714285714288273,0.00035714285714288273,0.00035714285714288273,0.00035714285714288273,0.00035714285714288273,0.00035714285714288273,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
51431,1,"The poet laureate and patron saint of sane science . As a one - time practicing physicist ( now just an "" arm - chair physicist "" ) and lifetime music lover , I have found this beautifully - written little book irresistible over the 17 years it has been in my library . In 1983 , when the original hardcover edition came out , this book was given to me as a gift by someone knowing my musical tastes , figuring that it would be the perfect gift . It turned out to be , but for reasons that are largely non - musical . As an arm - chair scientist , I 've read and enjoyed more than a few popularizations by well - known scientists over the years . These include Richard Feynman with his wry humor in virtually everything he wrote ( I number myself among those physicists who "" cut their eye teeth "" on the Feynman Lectures in Physics ) , Stephen Hawking , Brian Greene , Carl Sagan , and even Brian Swimme . ( The Swimme of "" A Walk Through Time "" goes down easily , and covers much of the same ground that Thomas does , but in a quite different way ; the Swimme of "" The Universe is a Green Dragon "" is a much harder sell for me due to its hard - pressed attempt to oversimplify . ) But for sheer elegance and poetry and breadth of scope , and for essays that provoke thought on the part of the reader , none can hold a candle to Thomas . Everyone who reads this little masterpiece will have his or her favorites . Here are a few of mine : In "" Things Unflattened by Science "" ( an essay on unaddressed and/or incomplete challenges that future scientists might well undertake ) , a paragraph on how biologists might endeavor to better understand what music is , and how it affects the human condition , starting with a rather small - scale assignment to explain the effect of Bach 's "" The Art of Fugue "" on the human mind . In "" Altruism "" ( an essay on the symbiotic interrelationships among species ) , how it is that such a condition actually exists , and a challenge to future scientists to better understand how our own species might become more altruistic ( and adult ) than it presently is . In "" The Attic of the Brain "" ( a cautionary essay on the risks of psychiatry , most importantly psychoanalysis , in terms of performing "" total brain dumps "" ) , the need for all of us to carry around a little clutter in our lives , as insurance against the chance that we might inadvertently lose our ability to retrieve something truly important . In the title ( and final ) essay , another cautionary tale , this time on thermonuclear weaponry , the most lucid description I 've ever read regarding the true meaning of this music as envisioned by Gustav Mahler . In a few brief but sublime paragraphs , Thomas has captured the essence of this remarkable opus in a way that no musician ( and that includes such Mahlerites as Bernstein , Karajan , Klemperer , Rattle and Walter ) ever had . Until very recently , that is , with the release a few months back of a staggering performance by Benjamin Zander , conductng the Philharmonia Orchestra . But that is another topic , and another review . In the seventeen years since the initial publication of this book , quite a bit has changed in our worldview , in some aspects of society and science . But not enough ! The observations and challenges that Thomas lays out will endure for centuries , provided only that we endure as well .

51443,1,"Rambles a bit Simon Winchester is a popular historian , in the modern mold . This means that he 's socially and politically a liberal , and that he 's interested in * everything * connected with a specific event . He 'll examine it from all angles , and attempt to see it from everyone 's eyes , look over everything connected with it , and then draw some conclusions . Usually , those conclusions over - reach some ( I 'm being general about this type of writer , not of Winchester specifically ) and the point of view is relentlessly modern . Winchester has chosen as the topic of this book the explosion of the volcano Krakatoa in 1883 . Interestingly , the author is trained as a geologist , though he has spent most of his life working as a journalist and writer . This means that he actually understands the terminology of geology and vulcanology enough that he can at least make an attempt to explain it to the rest of us in layman 's terms , and the result is generally a happy one . Krakatoa was a complex event ( the island had three summits , each a separate volcano : two disappeared in the explosion , but they erupted for a good while beforehand , and their effects lasted for years afterwards ) and Winchester does a good job of relating what happened , the prelude to it , and the aftermath . The one criticism that people have which I agree with is that he tends to wander a bit , at times . There are discussions here of everything from Dutch Colonial policy to the habits of spiders to rather technical ( though carefully explained ) geology . While it 's all interesting , sometimes it does stray a bit far from the chosen topic . The author also occasionally over - reaches , a bit . For instance , his assertion that the explosion of the volcano indirectly led to Indonesia 's independance is a bit much . My edition included a magazine article he 'd written just after the Boxing Day tsunami , in which he attempts to connect the San Francisco earthquake with George W. Bush 's election as U.S. President ... that seems and even bigger stretch , to be honest . When the author sticks to the story , however , what he writes is very interesting . I would recommend this book",418,1,0.23437999089514086,0.00042553191489365014,0.00042553191489365014,0.00042553191489365014,0.00042553191489365014,0.00042553191489365014,0.021909973839457867,0.1868111026567803,0.00042553191489365014,0.00042553191489365014,0.00042553191489365014,0.00042553191489365014,0.00042553191489365014,0.00042553191489365014,0.00042553191489365014,0.00042553191489365014,0.09275950965478258,0.00042553191489365014,0.00042553191489365014,0.00042553191489365014,0.00042553191489365014,0.00042553191489365014,0.00042553191489365014,0.00042553191489365014,0.037606560449147806,0.00042553191489365014,0.00042553191489365014,0.00042553191489365014,0.00042553191489365014,0.00042553191489365014,0.00042553191489365014,0.00042553191489365014,0.054791856150709424,0.00042553191489365014,0.00042553191489365014,0.00042553191489365014,0.3228072434844694,0.00042553191489365014,0.00042553191489365014,0.00042553191489365014,0.03106142244397847,0.00042553191489365014,0.00042553191489365014,0.00042553191489365014,0.00042553191489365014,0.00042553191489365014,0.00042553191489365014,0.00042553191489365014,0.00042553191489365014,0.00042553191489365014,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
51447,1,"No soup cans here ... Well , the name of this set does say it all . Fashion ! That 's the theme of this mix match stationery set . I liked it a bit more than some of the other mix match stationery sets out there . The paper quality is a teensy bit better with this set as the paper is slightly thicker . The illustrations are very colorful and pretty , it has drawings and he complements each with colors such as bright blue and fuchsia . The drawings are all bold and enjoyable ranging from a pattern of high - heeled shoes or little kisses to a close - up of a very Warhol - esque face . At the top of each sheet , there are little quotes of Andy 's relating to fashion . Very cool for maintaining the overall theme , I think . The different colored - envelopes each have a flap that more or less complements one of the particular sheet designs but of course , as the name suggests , it 's all open to a little mix match . Finally , there are quite a lot of stickers to decorate your mail as your will dictates . They 're very pretty too including purses , mannequins , kisses , and oh , they 're the clear kind so they look a little bit more distinguished . All in all , a very good way to spruce up your everyday mail .

51457,1,"Freedom is Choice , Constrained Citizen explores just what freedom really is as it follows a young man , Thorby , as he matures from boy to man . Starting as a slave sold to a most unusual beggar , Baslim , we see the first aspect that many equate with the absolute opposite of freedom , though we see that in fact ' slaves ' sometimes have more freedom of choice than ' free men ' . The society he paints here is vivid and believable ( though the economics of slavery in a star - travelling culture has always seemed a little dubious to me ) . Baslim is far more than he appears to be , and puts Thorby through a rigorous education , both academic and practical . How do you become a really good beggar ? Here Heinlein falls in with Ayn Rand - whatever you do , do it to the best of your ability , from begging to juggling . Also there are several comments included here about the integrity of the self - lies to others and misleading yourself both come in for some dictums . These are items that may pass over young readers ' heads , but perhaps planting seeds that all assumptions should be examined , nothing should be accepted on ' faith ' , that personal integrity is more important than ' success ' , that consequences of actions should be examined carefully before committing to that action . Later , Baslim calls in some favors and sends Thorby to live with the Free Traders , a group of space merchants that keep to themselves with their own unique culture . Here Thorby discovers another aspect of freedom : a person 's ability to do as he wishes is severely constrained by the culture in which he lives . The Free Trader society ( which owes much to Margaret Mead 's seminal ideas , and highlighted by an anthropologist character named Margaret Mader - Heinlein was not usually so obvious with his names ) of rigid matriarchal domination and separation into moieties provides security , peace of mind , and the ability through rigid rules of formalism to allow a small group of people to live together for extended periods without breaking any heads , but has as its downside great limitations on freedom of choice . This section of the book may be the best part , as the society is so different from today 's American culture that it becomes fascinating in its own right , apart from its effects on Thorby . Thorby himself grows and changes significantly in this part of the book , from first love to determining just how he must balance the demands of duty and personal desires . The last section deals with Thorby back on Earth , within a society not much different from our own , and shows a third aspect of freedom : the internal courageousness to make your own decisions and act upon them . Freedom is just as constrained by internal timidity and/or defining decisions as by external forces . As this last section offers little in terms of new or different views of society ( though it is a good mirror of some of the flaws of a capitalistic / lawyer dominated one ) , it is n't as engrossing as the first two sections , but is highly important in terms of completing Heinlein 's thematic investigation of all aspects of freedom . Characterization other than Thorby and Baslim is pretty thin , especially for the females that appear in supporting roles . This was fairly typical for his juveniles , as they were basically strong adventure novels with their primary focus on their central character . But the thematic line on slavery / freedom is much stronger here than most of his messages in other books , and as this particular position is also stated in some of those other works ( most especially Farnham 's Freehold ) , has to be seen as one of Heinlein 's personal beliefs ( unlike some other positions he proposes in his books that seem mainly designed to stir up debate ) . This book is not Heinlein 's absolute best , nor even the best of his so - called ' juveniles ' ( which are typically better reading than most ' adult ' mainstream bestsellers ) , but still provides an engrossing , fun , and illuminating read .

51476,1,"Iran , Tormented Soul in Search of an Identity Kenneth Pollack first gives his readers an excellent introduction to the remarkable history of Iran from the rise of the Persian Empire to the reign of the Pahlavis ( pp . 3 - 100 ) . Pollack shows clearly how nationalist and xenophobic Iran got wary of meddling foreigners , starting with the hated Russians and Brits , in its domestic affairs ( pp . 4 , 41 ) . Many Iranians have angry psychological scars , believing that foreigners are the source of all their problems for partially understandable reasons ( pp . 26 , 71 , 89 , 99 , 125 , 128 , 155 - 56 , 161 , 173 - 74 , 242 , 297 , 389 ) . Pollack focuses the bulk of his book on a balanced account of the troubled American - Iranian relations in the last 50 + years . The U.S. started building its "" satanic "" reputation after the CIA played a key role in helping the Brits get rid of Iran 's popular Prime Minister Mohammad Mosaddeq in 1953 ( pp . 57 - 67 ) . Mosaddeq 's "" crime "" was the "" illegal "" nationalization of the Iranian oil industry under control of the rapacious Brits ( pp . 52 - 56 ) . The U.S. did not improve its reputation among most Iranians by supporting the dictatorial Shah who largely mismanaged the modernization of Iran until his overthrow in 1979 ( pp . xxv , 72 - 140 ) . Pollack convincingly demonstrates that the Truman Administration and its successors usually did not exercise enough pressure on the Shah to democratize and liberalize Iran when they had the opportunity to do it ( pp . 49 , 76 - 77 , 81 , 89 - 90 , 104 , 121 - 24 , 136 - 40 ) . The Shah , who was ironically considered sold out to the West , became less and less amenable to the "" omniscient "" U.S. , beginning in the mid-1960s ( pp . 39 , 50 , 84 , 94 , 99 - 100 , 107 , 120 - 27 , 158 , 173 ) . After the revolution of 1979 , the U.S. mostly supported Saddam Hussein during the Iran - Iraq war and funded different destabilization operations to contain and try to overthrow the Islamic Republic ( pp . 206 - 16 , 259 - 65 , 273 - 76 , 386 ) . The U.S. apologized in 2000 for some past misdeeds in an unsuccessful attempt to improve its relations with Teheran under the presidency of the moderate but ultimately ineffective Mohammad Kathami , who was under relentless pressure from the hard - liners ( pp . xxv , 303 - 42 ) . Pollack blames with equal conviction the Iranians for the awful relations existing between both countries . Iran has built its reputation of international pariah due to the illegal seizure of the U.S. embassy staff in 1979 , its lack of democratic credentials , its support of terrorism around the world , its opposition to the Middle East peace process , and its pursuit of ( nuclear ) WMDs ( pp . xxi , 141 - 80 , 182 , 198 - 201 , 237 - 40 , 248 , 256 - 59 , 266 - 67 , 277 , 345 , 379 - 82 ) . Pollack also explains to its readers that many Iranians have a poor understanding of the U.S. ( pp . 50 , 180 , 309 ) . Pollack does not hesitate to show repeatedly that greed has not stopped the international community , including the U.S. at times , from doing business with Iran in the last 25 + years ( pp . 164 - 65 , 262 - 65 , 271 - 72 , 286 - 89 ) . Iran is trying without much success to emulate China by crushing internal dissent and favoring economic development ( pp . xxiv , 250 , 369 - 73 , 390 - 91 ) . The U.S. will be of no help in this endeavor as long as Iran stubbornly clings to its pursuit of acquiring nuclear military expertise on top of other objectionable actions ( pp . 273 , 312 , 324 , 351 ) . Pollack tries to crack the Iranian enigma by rightly ruling out an invasion of Iran due to its size , population , and topography ( pp . xxiii , 383 - 86 ) . Pollack ultimately pleads for a three - pronged strategy that rests on an unconvincing mix of carrots and sticks ( pp . 375 - 424 ) . The U.S.-led international community seems to believe that Iran will "" submit "" to the "" diktats "" of foreigners in the nuclear crisis without undermining again the "" legitimacy "" of the hard - liners ( pp . xxv - xxvi , 157 , 251 , 352 , 365 , 395 - 400 ) . Hard - liners have not forgotten the humiliation of 1988 ( pp . 227 - 33 ) . Nuclear WMDs would shield Iran from further "" humiliating "" foreign interference ( pp . 259 , 361 - 69).The Shi'i hard - liners , inspired by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini and co , relish martyrdom and heavy sacrifices ( pp . 157 , 177 - 79 , 222 - 23 , 302 ) . Like most of his predecessors , President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad is seeking confrontation with the international community as a way of diverting Iranians ' attention from their problems for which ideology is a poor solution ( pp . 158 , 238 , 243 , 293 - 96 , 348 , 369 - 74 ) . Iranian hard - liners can find plenty of inspiration in the playbooks of Adolf Hitler and co . The U.S. will discover again at its own expense that key countries will balk at acting responsibly after Iran predictably fails to comply with the legitimate demands of the society of nations ( pp . 165 , 262 ) . Iranian hard - liners consider weakness a defensive and reactive policy towards their offensive agenda ( pp . 218 , 234 - 35 , 266 , 300 ) . Nothing meaningful will happen until the implementation of very comprehensive economic / financial sanctions and the credible threat of massive strategic bombardments against the nuclear and revolutionary power infrastructure across Iran ( pp . 299 , 301 , 392 - 95 ) . Iran has not been impressed with half - baked carrots like the Critical Dialogue and , with "" Mini - Me "" sticks such as Dual Containment and a few cruise missiles ( pp . 265 , 273 - 76 , 283 - 84 , 291 , 337 - 38 , 344 , 391).There will be no free lunch ( p. 385 ) . Stepped - up war against ( state - sponsored ) terrorism will require a series of "" patriotic "" sacrifices to mitigate the inevitable , short - term sharp increase in energy prices . Furthermore , there will be a new spike in terrorist operations as a "" payback "" for muscular action against Iran ( pp . 253 , 345 - 49 , 354 - 58 , 373 , 392).If Iran is not stopped before it acquires nuclear WMDs , it will indulge with a vengeance its own regional hegemonic aspirations not only in the Persian Gulf , but also in Central Asia ( pp . 253 - 56 ) . Energy prices will not go down in this scenario . Furthermore , Iranian hard - liners could consider Southern Russia and Chinese Xinjiang fair game for their revolutionary agenda due to the sub - optimal treatment of many Muslim minorities in these areas ( pp . 198 - 205 ) . Their military nuclear program is not purely defensive . Whoever ignores the past , will pay a heavy price down the road .",1361,1,0.0002816901408451082,0.14332386233259659,0.040093880176806575,0.0002816901408451082,0.0002816901408451082,0.0002816901408451082,0.0002816901408451082,0.09469575725506793,0.0002816901408451082,0.0002816901408451082,0.0002816901408451082,0.0002816901408451082,0.12823169173527932,0.0002816901408451082,0.014365870128184017,0.0002816901408451082,0.0002816901408451082,0.0002816901408451082,0.0002816901408451082,0.0002816901408451082,0.0002816901408451082,0.08615580022225897,0.0002816901408451082,0.014702020047344442,0.01859936122367676,0.0002816901408451082,0.0002816901408451082,0.0002816901408451082,0.0002816901408451082,0.0002816901408451082,0.0002816901408451082,0.07280415333487285,0.0002816901408451082,0.0002816901408451082,0.0002816901408451082,0.0002816901408451082,0.023266678449065863,0.0002816901408451082,0.025546266926770218,0.0002816901408451082,0.08719845996952252,0.022853919010687406,0.03479024608225167,0.0002816901408451082,0.0002816901408451082,0.16354791738636418,0.020246650930517147,0.0002816901408451082,0.0002816901408451082,0.0002816901408451082,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0

51495,1,"The importance of character in an age of image Os Guinness has a knack for taking difficult and complex subjects and capturing and presenting information that allows small chunks of the philosophy to be grasped and pondered deeply . This book is no exception . The fact that it is also a study guide is even more effective in delivering the message while directing the reader to several key questions to consider in each section . One of the best aspects of the book are the hundreds of quotes and essays , all around the central theme of the importance of character . While our culture often acts to create an "" end justifies the means "" behavioral set , never before has character been so important , or so difficult to really practice and live . The book begins with some essays from famous leaders ; from Plato to George Washington , Winston Churchill to Machiavelli , and compares and contrasts what each felt about the importance of character , and how it was to be demonstrated . Much of the material is pretty well known , yet the ability to so easily read and discuss different styles and approaches is well worth the effort . My favorite sections were on the "" Cultural Erosions of Character "" in which the many examples of how society pushes and changes the definition and meaning in life impacts what we define as important at all . From advertising , to media , the pressure to conform is greater than ever , but in some ways has always existed . One of the best essay 's in my opinion is called the "" Revenge of Failure "" wherein Henry Fairlie rips the "" legend of our times "" , as envy at its worst . No longer content to envy what others have and we do not , we now attempt to destroy in others that which we can not achieve ourselves . This process degrades talent and is a poor attempt to "" buy "" our way into importance not through the achievement of something remarkable , but through the tearing down of the remarkable achievement into something attainable . Thus character becomes something that is no longer "" earned"" . The sections on plastic surgery and other shifts into a looks based culture further erode the importance of character . In this relentless and obsessed pursuit of the elusive perfection , the hunter becomes the hunted , and always loses in the battle to fight against aging and the myth of happiness in ones physical appearance . Powerful depictions of how this societal pressure has claimed far too many who sacrifice character for fleeting and shallow appearance , are depicted with a convicting clarity . Overall , this is a very well done and thought provoking book . As a study guide it would be ideal for small groups , or even personal reflections . The book is so full of quotes and essays that it can be read at once , or in dozens of small bites with equal effectiveness . Highly recommended .",525,1,0.00032786885245906063,0.00032786885245906063,0.020409177278553167,0.00032786885245906063,0.00032786885245906063,0.00032786885245906063,0.00032786885245906063,0.052207318438012504,0.00032786885245906063,0.00032786885245906063,0.00032786885245906063,0.03319843039102294,0.00032786885245906063,0.00032786885245906063,0.00032786885245906063,0.00032786885245906063,0.00032786885245906063,0.06192353667850013,0.00032786885245906063,0.00032786885245906063,0.00032786885245906063,0.00032786885245906063,0.00032786885245906063,0.00032786885245906063,0.08330058851482018,0.021221061342553024,0.00032786885245906063,0.00032786885245906063,0.00032786885245906063,0.00032786885245906063,0.00032786885245906063,0.00032786885245906063,0.13990629608946356,0.00032786885245906063,0.05212643146657701,0.00032786885245906063,0.4892733866522006,0.00032786885245906063,0.00032786885245906063,0.03331901904993442,0.00032786885245906063,0.00032786885245906063,0.00032786885245906063,0.00032786885245906063,0.00032786885245906063,0.00032786885245906063,0.00032786885245906063,0.00032786885245906063,0.00032786885245906063,0.00032786885245906063,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I read this for school and it was n't hard to finish it because it amazed me with what everything really was . Usually I read fiction books that have diseases or disorders in them . I figured that there should be some explaination for me . It was nt hard to follow . Also everything was explained very well . I did n't have any real background other than the fictions books that you really could n't go by,107,1,0.0010000000000000956,0.0010000000000000956,0.0010000000000000956,0.0010000000000000956,0.0010000000000000956,0.05477127718727249,0.0010000000000000956,0.0010000000000000956,0.0010000000000000956,0.0010000000000000956,0.0010000000000000956,0.0010000000000000956,0.18423652552959993,0.0010000000000000956,0.0010000000000000956,0.0010000000000000956,0.0010000000000000956,0.0010000000000000956,0.0010000000000000956,0.0010000000000000956,0.0010000000000000956,0.0010000000000000956,0.0010000000000000956,0.0010000000000000956,0.0010000000000000956,0.055074838396931225,0.0010000000000000956,0.0010000000000000956,0.0010000000000000956,0.0683360291602717,0.0010000000000000956,0.0010000000000000956,0.0010000000000000956,0.0010000000000000956,0.0010000000000000956,0.0010000000000000956,0.5925813297259206,0.0010000000000000956,0.0010000000000000956,0.0010000000000000956,0.0010000000000000956,0.0010000000000000956,0.0010000000000000956,0.0010000000000000956,0.0010000000000000956,0.0010000000000000956,0.0010000000000000956,0.0010000000000000956,0.0010000000000000956,0.0010000000000000956,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1
51526,1,"This book won Thomas Mann a well - deserved Nobel Prize After viewing the German artistic mini - series for television many years ago , I decided to read this German family story to rival Galsworthy 's Forsythe Saga . I was not disappointed , because this book deals , among others , with one essential aspect of human existence : man 's difficulty in adapting to hardships and changes in social status . The story of the Buddenbrooks is a story of moral values among individuals who , although belong to the same family , can be astonishingly different in their understanding of life and their grasp of reality . In this family we see characters who are able to adapt , understand the world and compromise , while at the same time we are exposed to those who are limited by their own upbringing to a life of limited flexibility and eventual disillusion and self - abandon . This fundamental book of world literature attacks two antithetic facets of human nature , two views of the world that are constantly at battle within all human beings . It is for this reason that quot;Buddenbrooks quot ; is fundamentally an allegory about man and his internal turmoil with the major challenges of life , a carefully crafted story with psychological insight that makes the reading of this book definitely worthwhil",231,1,0.00047619047619050747,0.00047619047619050747,0.024286666592998864,0.00047619047619050747,0.00047619047619050747,0.00047619047619050747,0.00047619047619050747,0.3461158843404996,0.00047619047619050747,0.00047619047619050747,0.00047619047619050747,0.00047619047619050747,0.00047619047619050747,0.00047619047619050747,0.00047619047619050747,0.00047619047619050747,0.00047619047619050747,0.00047619047619050747,0.00047619047619050747,0.026572388213149917,0.00047619047619050747,0.00047619047619050747,0.00047619047619050747,0.02551890156681915,0.00047619047619050747,0.00047619047619050747,0.00047619047619050747,0.00047619047619050747,0.00047619047619050747,0.00047619047619050747,0.00047619047619050747,0.00047619047619050747,0.00047619047619050747,0.00047619047619050747,0.2199854796553873,0.00047619047619050747,0.23294054683961957,0.04982129729579337,0.00047619047619050747,0.00047619047619050747,0.05475883549573083,0.00047619047619050747,0.00047619047619050747,0.00047619047619050747,0.00047619047619050747,0.00047619047619050747,0.00047619047619050747,0.00047619047619050747,0.00047619047619050747,0.00047619047619050747,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

51537,1,"A Valid Reason for Betrayal ? I think Nora Roberts has a fantasy with horses and horse farms , as we 've seen in her books Irish Thoroughbred , Irish Rebel and now True Betrayals which was written in 1996 . Unlike the other two , True Betrayals is not pure romantic fiction but a blend of several genres . To me , it was very interesting and kept me amused and entertained for several hours . Kelsey Byden was led to believe that her mother , Naomi Chadwick , had been dead for quite a few years and when she received a letter from her mother asking if she 'd come visit her , she was an emotional wreck . It seems the real reason her mother was n't a part of her life as she grew up was the fact that she had been in prison for killing her lover . Talk about shock value ! Kelsey decides to visit her mother to try to come to terms with her emotions - Kelsey had recently divorced and just finding out her dead mother was very much alive was enough to make anyone emotionally unstable and made Kelsey question everything in her life . Naomi has a working horse farm in Virginia and Kelsey goes to try to make sense out of her life . Sounds like a typical plot line , right ? Well , sort of , but if Nora Roberts is writing it , you can bet there are a few twists and turns along the way . Like Kelsey being thrown into a situation that could result in another murder . Can the trainer who works for her mother be the answer to Kelsey 's broken heart ? Can Kelsey ever trust her mother again after being deceived by her for so many years ? Will Kelsey ever believe in herself again ? I wo n't give away any of the plot , you 'll have to read and enjoy this one for yourself!I do have to say that the plot is not the part of the book that I enjoyed the most - sure there 's a little mystery thrown in just to keep things interesting . Sure there is lots of romance and sorting of feelings toward the mother - daughter relationship . But what I enjoyed the most were the descriptions of the horse ranch , the surrounding areas , actual workings of the ranch , etc . Nora Roberts is first rate at painting a very vivid mental image and I found myself slipping off to Virginia and owning a ranch of my own in my imagination while reading this book . The lush green landscape , the openness of the working ranch , the racetrack - ah , it sounded like pure heaven . The plot is very predictable : everyone lives happily - ever - after , mother and daughter are reunited , true love waits for Kelsey , etc . , etc . What makes the story enjoyable is the mix that Roberts has perfected - not just pure romance , but a little mystery and intrigue also .",531,1,0.10168003766313248,0.00022727272727274505,0.00022727272727274505,0.027429867633962518,0.00022727272727274505,0.00022727272727274505,0.00022727272727274505,0.06888763039120356,0.00022727272727274505,0.00022727272727274505,0.00022727272727274505,0.012001966803464272,0.15627448139569677,0.00022727272727274505,0.00022727272727274505,0.00022727272727274505,0.03558754541386186,0.00022727272727274505,0.00022727272727274505,0.00022727272727274505,0.00022727272727274505,0.06844114179928527,0.00022727272727274505,0.00022727272727274505,0.00022727272727274505,0.00022727272727274505,0.00022727272727274505,0.00022727272727274505,0.00022727272727274505,0.015687286292346725,0.00022727272727274505,0.00022727272727274505,0.00022727272727274505,0.00022727272727274505,0.1642676251306365,0.00022727272727274505,0.1702901130616996,0.00022727272727274505,0.00022727272727274505,0.00022727272727274505,0.030765764772432463,0.14005017600591385,0.00022727272727274505,0.00022727272727274505,0.00022727272727274505,0.00022727272727274505,0.00022727272727274505,0.00022727272727274505,0.00022727272727274505,0.00022727272727274505,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

51557,1,"A quick , terrific read Once again , David McCullough 's treatment of an american icon is the best of its kind . This biography reads like a fascinating novel , and McCulloughs narrative ability is unmatched . No one seems to be able to tell a story the way he can . The great Theodore Roosevelt , known throughout the world and across the ages as an incredibly strong , tough , larger than life figure actually began as somewhat of a weakling . The book covers his total transformation from a sickly child to a man of great resolve and courage , the man who would become President of the United States . Best of all is that McCullough likes and admires his subject . This is not always the case with biographies . Roosevelt and his family are treated with the dignity and respect they deserve . Highly recommended , as are all of McCullough 's books",160,1,0.0007142857142857481,0.0007142857142857481,0.0007142857142857481,0.0007142857142857481,0.12742658791024933,0.0007142857142857481,0.0007142857142857481,0.3371867394990152,0.0007142857142857481,0.0007142857142857481,0.0007142857142857481,0.07217165743217413,0.0007142857142857481,0.0007142857142857481,0.0007142857142857481,0.0007142857142857481,0.0007142857142857481,0.0007142857142857481,0.0007142857142857481,0.0007142857142857481,0.0007142857142857481,0.0007142857142857481,0.0007142857142857481,0.0007142857142857481,0.0007142857142857481,0.0007142857142857481,0.0007142857142857481,0.0007142857142857481,0.0007142857142857481,0.0007142857142857481,0.0007142857142857481,0.03642857157267968,0.0007142857142857481,0.0007142857142857481,0.0007142857142857481,0.0007142857142857481,0.25380377989372727,0.0007142857142857481,0.0007142857142857481,0.0007142857142857481,0.0007142857142857481,0.05419530818410842,0.0007142857142857481,0.0007142857142857481,0.0007142857142857481,0.08807306979375878,0.0007142857142857481,0.0007142857142857481,0.0007142857142857481,0.0007142857142857481,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
51567,1,"Good History Book , Bad Science Reference Bishop presents an entertaining history of bees and beekeeping , and gives us an absolutely fascinting tour into the relationship between humans and bees , both ancient and modern . What she misses are her science references : On page 142 , Bishop recounts the removal of a stinger : "" ... he grabbed the whole sac , which simply squeezed in more venom . "" This is not true . It is an oft - repeated piece of conventional wisdom , but in 1996 , entomologists at UC Riverside published an article in The Lancet ( 348:301 - 302 ) , with the conclusion that rather than removal method , speed is of the essence . Visscher and Vetter wrote of their conclusion : "" The method of removal is irrelevant , but even slight delays in removal caused by concerns over performing it correctly ( or getting out a knife blade or credit card ) are likely to increase the dose of venom received . The advice should be changed to simply emphasize that the sting should be removed , and as quickly as possible . "" On page 276 , Bishop writes about royal jelly "" ... worker bees secrete and feed exclusively to a select few fertilized eggs , one of which , on this special diet , will grow into a queen . "" This is patently incorrect . Royal jelly , as all beekeepers know , is fed to all the brood by nursery bees for the first 2 - 3 days of the brood 's development . After this time , most brood who are not destined to be queens will receive pollen as food , whereas queens are fed the jelly all their lives . It is rather stunning that an author who keeps bees herself and obviouly spent considerable efforts in researching her book can make such a glaring error in bee knowledge . This was quite a blow to me at this point in the book as I have enjoyed the book very much , and to run into such a blatantly uninformed statement from the author caused me major disappointment . Otherwise , this is quite a good , absorbing read .",380,1,0.17560117421052374,0.0005000000000000564,0.09605112587261531,0.0005000000000000564,0.0005000000000000564,0.0005000000000000564,0.03268546753923817,0.0005000000000000564,0.0005000000000000564,0.0005000000000000564,0.0005000000000000564,0.05394816097166396,0.0005000000000000564,0.0005000000000000564,0.024762225571043687,0.0005000000000000564,0.05655932937653339,0.0005000000000000564,0.0005000000000000564,0.0005000000000000564,0.0005000000000000564,0.0005000000000000564,0.0005000000000000564,0.0005000000000000564,0.0005000000000000564,0.0005000000000000564,0.0005000000000000564,0.0005000000000000564,0.0005000000000000564,0.0005000000000000564,0.0005000000000000564,0.056649433358084984,0.0005000000000000564,0.0005000000000000564,0.0688372614141804,0.0005000000000000564,0.38521586835892774,0.0005000000000000564,0.0005000000000000564,0.0005000000000000564,0.0005000000000000564,0.0005000000000000564,0.0005000000000000564,0.0005000000000000564,0.0005000000000000564,0.0005000000000000564,0.029689953327186287,0.0005000000000000564,0.0005000000000000564,0.0005000000000000564,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
51569,1,"An Often Overlooked Gem TRUMAN CAPOTE 's wrote THE GRASS HARP early in his career and it is an often overlooked gem . This sweet , eccentric , moving and decidedly southern tale is the leisurely paced story of the repercussions that ensue when three townfolk decide to up and run away to live in a treehouse on the outskirts of town . Three quickly becomes five and eventually swells to even more as the makeshift home becomes a sort of paradise and refuge where stories are shared , closeness is established , and love blooms .... think FLANNERY O'CONNOR meets SWISS FAMILY ROBINSON with a dash of STEEL MAGNOLIAS .

51576,1,"No comparison to the film "" East of Eden "" is a beautifully written , sprawling , three generation saga of the men and women who settled the Salinas Valley in California . The story begins far away in the East , on the farm of the unscrupulous Cyrus Trask and his two sons , Adam and Charles . Adam is an upright , honest young man who naturally draws people to him , while Charles has an angry , violent spirit . Charles tries in vain to earn the love of his father , and takes his anger at his failure out on Adam . Adam is sent by his father into the army as a sign of his love , but Cyrus keeps Charles close to home , knowing that war would release something dangerous and violent in his other son . Adam wanders for many years across the country after his service , and some of the most lyrical passages in the book describe his life as a tramp , closely mirroring Steinbeck 's own experiences during the Depression . Finally he returns to the farm and exists in uneasy partnership with Charles until the mysterious Cathy arrives . The more astute Charles quickly realizes her true nature , but innocent Adam marries her and they move to California . Adam expects Cathy to pursue his dream of life on a ranch , but Cathy is a vicious , evil character with no redeeming qualities , and after the birth of twin sons she escapes only to re - emerge much later when her sons are grown . Adam hibernates for many years on the ranch , broken - hearted over Cathy 's desertion , and convinced he must hide the secret from his sons forever , which become an impossible task . Repeating the pattern of their father 's life , the twins Aron and Caleb vie for their father 's love , with Aron effortlessly winning it while Caleb comes to believe there is something evil lurking in his spirit . But this time around , Caleb is redeemed in a way Charles never was . Steinbeck 's prose is masterful , and his descriptions of the Salinas Valley , lush with the rains , brutal with the drought , capture exactly why men were drawn to the west . His portrayals of character and motives -- sadly lacking in the movie -- are totally convincing , and his Adam is a flawed but admirable character . Steinbeck has been a bit out of favor -- at least until this was chosen as an Oprah book . As an English - as - a - second - language teacher I recently taught "" The Pearl , "" and that book too surprised me with its gorgeous writing and subtle imagery . ( We all read it in high school but I now realize it went right over my head . ) Try Steinbeck again -- you wo n't be disappointed -- my book club was n't !",512,1,0.05413995082369006,0.046372562047407244,0.00031250000000002895,0.00031250000000002895,0.00031250000000002895,0.01867484296846365,0.00031250000000002895,0.17222607672398937,0.00031250000000002895,0.00031250000000002895,0.00031250000000002895,0.00031250000000002895,0.00031250000000002895,0.00031250000000002895,0.00031250000000002895,0.00031250000000002895,0.00031250000000002895,0.00031250000000002895,0.00031250000000002895,0.00031250000000002895,0.050448186883312034,0.00031250000000002895,0.00031250000000002895,0.00031250000000002895,0.00031250000000002895,0.08517228354779252,0.017659863097305654,0.00031250000000002895,0.00031250000000002895,0.00031250000000002895,0.00031250000000002895,0.016338548376940744,0.06586504363219546,0.00031250000000002895,0.10131604862802286,0.00031250000000002895,0.18631976342638412,0.03334816158134357,0.00031250000000002895,0.00031250000000002895,0.040364833947143325,0.07846918626683143,0.00031250000000002895,0.0223471480491769,0.00031250000000002895,0.00031250000000002895,0.00031250000000002895,0.00031250000000002895,0.00031250000000002895,0.00031250000000002895,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
51579,1,"Another excellent book by Connelly A very good crime fiction book . Connelly fans should buy this book without any hesitation if you do n't have it already . Why it 's good?1 ) Connelly is very good at creating 3 dimensional , believable , realistic characters and this book is no different.2 ) A very realistic behind the scene look in the inner workings of a police department , he 's supposed to have been a crime beat writer.3 ) Logical plot . His books are not as fast flowing or edge of the seat exciting or scary as some thrillers , but they ca n't be if they are crime fiction . Rather , he takes you through the investigation step by step , going through the process that his detectives go through so you can see how they solve the crime . Cons : The only con I have is that the books are somewhat noir ( I 'm plagarizing this word from some other review ) . The thing is , Bosch is not your spiffy "" yes sir "" , toe the blue line cop . And so , even though you want Bosch not to stir the pot and just get on with his detecting he does his best to sabotage his position in the force and your wishes , well , c'est la vie , apparently Connelly likes to put angst in his readers ' lives . I'm not going to spoil the book , if you must know what the book is about you can read the intro . All I 'm trying to get across is why this book is good .

51596,1,"An epic portrayal of an important , maligned truth . Ayn Rand 's masterwork earns its reputation as a monumentally influential book . It is at least as important today as it was when it was published in 1957 . Altas Shrugged lays out , in the form of a sprawling novel , Rand 's philosophy , Objectivism . It has been said in a couple of different surveys that the book is ranked by Americans as the second most influencial to them , trailing only the Bible . Atlas Shrugged covers a lot of philosophical ground , but at its heart is a story that drives home the importance of the people who produce disproportionately in society ; people who invent , design , build , manufacture , improve and manage . She lays out the a story of a society that resents these people and their wealth despite the fact that they earned it and that they improved everyone 's standard of living while they improved their own . Mysteriously , society 's producers start vanishing , one at a time until almost none are left . The outcome and the explanation are fun reading while they make an important point . Our society has been wealthy enough for long enough that it is way too easy to take that wealth for granted and forget where it comes from . The decisions we make when we fail to keep in mind the source of the wealth do really have the power to make our standard of living go away . Rand reminds us of this critical , but easily forgotten lesson in an eloquent way . Read it and then tell ten friends to read it too . More of us need to see this side of the story . The fact that it 's unpopular right now just makes it that much more fun",317,1,0.42908311417979117,0.00037037037037040315,0.00037037037037040315,0.00037037037037040315,0.00037037037037040315,0.00037037037037040315,0.00037037037037040315,0.00037037037037040315,0.02291356133995045,0.00037037037037040315,0.00037037037037040315,0.00037037037037040315,0.00037037037037040315,0.00037037037037040315,0.00037037037037040315,0.00037037037037040315,0.00037037037037040315,0.00037037037037040315,0.00037037037037040315,0.00037037037037040315,0.00037037037037040315,0.00037037037037040315,0.00037037037037040315,0.00037037037037040315,0.00037037037037040315,0.00037037037037040315,0.00037037037037040315,0.00037037037037040315,0.00037037037037040315,0.00037037037037040315,0.00037037037037040315,0.00037037037037040315,0.00037037037037040315,0.00037037037037040315,0.1566765022863739,0.00037037037037040315,0.2571132855434041,0.00037037037037040315,0.00037037037037040315,0.022435995025411458,0.00037037037037040315,0.020060428601584822,0.020930986474248042,0.00037037037037040315,0.00037037037037040315,0.055230570993679,0.00037037037037040315,0.00037037037037040315,0.00037037037037040315,0.00037037037037040315,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

51616,1,"Gripping ! This is one of Nora Roberts ' best books ever ! I have read everything she 's written and this is now my all time favorite . I ADORE this book . The characters are interesting and very human , the plot is gripping and the background fascinating . Callie , an archeologist , comes to a little town in Maryland to set up a dig and ends up learning about her birth parents and reuniting with her ex - husband . What I really like about this is the two main characters already have a history before this book so its so much that they fall in love on the spur of the moment , like most romances ( including Roberts ) . Definitely a book I highly recommend for both the romance and the thrilling plot .

51643,1,"Creating Mindful Reactions That Are Good for Your Health ! I decided to read this book because I enjoyed Dr. O'Connor 's book , Undoing Depression so much . I am delighted to report that Undoing Perpetual Stress is an even better book . What is perpetual stress like ? The metaphor that Dr. O'Connor uses is that of an impala who thinks there 's a cheetah behind every rock . The flight or fight response is never at rest . . . and the poor impala 's health is soon destroyed . Dr . O'Connor argues that our over stimulating world creates the same kinds of stress from unseen "" threats "" as the world goes whizzing by at 75 miles per hour . In the book , he describes the sources of the stress , how stress undermines your body , immune system , brain and mind , and what you can do to put the stress comfortably in the background . This book will appeal to those who are stressed out , those who experience anxiety and depression at the same time , those who love such people , and those who want to better understand the mind - body connection based on the latest scientific research . Undoing Perpetual Stress is filled with many helpful exercises that will help even those who do n't think they have too much stress . One of the best from my perspective was taking a psychological snapshot of yourself every five years . . . and spotting what was wrong with your life at each stage . I was astonished to realize how many memories I had repressed , but which are still influencing my psychology . And Dr. O'Connor is good about reminding you to "" practice , practice , practice "" the exercises and his advice . I have been a meditator for over ten years , and this book helped me to gain a lot of perspective on what the meditation is helping and what it is not . While I have eliminated a lot of the background noise , I have n't dealt with a lot of old issues . It was helpful to find out what those issues are . . . and what to do about them . I found that my creativity and mind were suddenly freed by the process . For parents , there 's a lot of new information here on how various parenting methods influence a child over a lifetime . It 's a lot better than what you read in that first book about how to be a parent . Check it out!This book should be required reading for anyone who finishes high school",455,1,0.2661358575858006,0.0003333333333333654,0.024158332898801777,0.0003333333333333654,0.0003333333333333654,0.0003333333333333654,0.0003333333333333654,0.0791080069742897,0.0003333333333333654,0.0003333333333333654,0.0003333333333333654,0.0003333333333333654,0.0003333333333333654,0.0003333333333333654,0.0003333333333333654,0.0003333333333333654,0.029976302084961253,0.0003333333333333654,0.0003333333333333654,0.0003333333333333654,0.0003333333333333654,0.0003333333333333654,0.0003333333333333654,0.017908282228487577,0.0003333333333333654,0.06007719252916592,0.0003333333333333654,0.0003333333333333654,0.0003333333333333654,0.0003333333333333654,0.0003333333333333654,0.0003333333333333654,0.0003333333333333654,0.0003333333333333654,0.0003333333333333654,0.0003333333333333654,0.3220556259170305,0.0003333333333333654,0.0003333333333333654,0.0003333333333333654,0.08229060422704121,0.01682721260507729,0.0003333333333333654,0.0003333333333333654,0.08812924961600949,0.0003333333333333654,0.0003333333333333654,0.0003333333333333654,0.0003333333333333654,0.0003333333333333654,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0
51659,1,"A Loving Look At Middle Earth This book was originally published ca 1980 as England and Always . I have not seen the original so I ca n't tell how much of this book is new material ( beyond a chapter dealing with Peter Jackson 's films ) . Lobdell has examined Tolkien 's writings from several interesting and unusual perspectives . One of the most interesting deals with the influence of Edwardian adventure fiction ( Haggard , etc . ) on Tolkien . Another fascinating chapter deals with Middle Earth as a Christian world in a pre - Christian age . There is also a short fiction story in an Appendix which is meant to be a sort of parallel to Tolkien 's own abandoned sequel to The Lord of the Rings , The Return of the Shadow . I enjoyed this story , though of course Lobdell as a fiction writer can not measure up to Tolkien . ( But then , no one can!)I am a long time Tolkien reader and addict ( since the age of 12 in 1969 . ) Most of the time I do not care for Tolkien "" criticism "" and "" literary analysis "" , which to me seems to suck out the magic , but Lobdell 's work is different . The World of the Rings enhances Middle Earth and intensifies the love I feel for it",237,1,0.249591216568655,0.0005263157894737273,0.0005263157894737273,0.0005263157894737273,0.0005263157894737273,0.0005263157894737273,0.0005263157894737273,0.0005263157894737273,0.0005263157894737273,0.0005263157894737273,0.0005263157894737273,0.0005263157894737273,0.0005263157894737273,0.0005263157894737273,0.0005263157894737273,0.0005263157894737273,0.0005263157894737273,0.0005263157894737273,0.0005263157894737273,0.0005263157894737273,0.0005263157894737273,0.0005263157894737273,0.0005263157894737273,0.0005263157894737273,0.0005263157894737273,0.0005263157894737273,0.06277690381405816,0.0005263157894737273,0.0005263157894737273,0.0005263157894737273,0.0005263157894737273,0.0005263157894737273,0.0005263157894737273,0.0005263157894737273,0.2397917791316315,0.0005263157894737273,0.27066776583844676,0.0005263157894737273,0.04835847255674053,0.0005263157894737273,0.0005263157894737273,0.0005263157894737273,0.0005263157894737273,0.10565596735362412,0.0005263157894737273,0.0005263157894737273,0.0005263157894737273,0.0005263157894737273,0.0005263157894737273,0.0005263157894737273,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
51662,1,"One of King 's Best Masterfully thought out written . Not your usual supernatural , horror King story . Written in 4 - 5 completely different chapters there is some supernatural , but it begins as a story of some friends in childhood , follows them through the years culminates with them as adults . Each chapter is completely different yet ties some characters in . At the end they are all tied together in some ways years later . It 's ingenious in it 's finale and I advise you set aside some time for reading . It 's very difficult to put down . Once it grabs your interest , it just sucks you into the story .

51679,1,"An Alternative Ending ? I think one of my major problems was the level of opinion being shotat the reader in the book . But then at times that made the book moreentertaining - its acerbic opinion of the right , how Reagan gettingelected made her feel stupid about being American , a funny British couple . The description of small details from each of the characters ' childhood was something Icould relate to because i think of that myself . There were clevertidbits from anthropology , and economics , and generally all fields ofintellectual inquiry , all somehow connected with the patchwork of loveand relationships , and thus brain meets heart and you end up withsomething almost like the Bible for our times . The focus on the maincharacter made it so that every detail about him was described . Anyway , I am rambling , so , a note about the ending : I did find myself thinking this is getting very strange as the bookgot towards the ending . It might have made more sense if Nelsonactually was interested in the new girl the narrator finds for him , and the story then comes full circle . It would end in a nice ironicsort of way . However , his rejecting her makes in my mind for whatwould be a bad traditional ending . I do n't mind this , since the onetime I wrote a story for a creative writing course I ended up with aterrible traditional ending . Now , could he have been anything otherthan a mystic ? I felt that there was some hint towards Hinduism andspirituality building up towards the end . He mentioned India andHinduism unexpectedly and repeatedly at one point in the book . So hisbecoming a mystic was alluding perhaps to the ashramas - and histransition from intellectual worker to a mystical worker to eventuallya sage , as he attains Nirvana and becomes the Buddha of our times . Soin this way an ending emphasizing the spiritual , is perhaps the best . In line with the book , the spiritual is the eternal , and onlyaccessible through life - changing ( near - death ) experience . What you dofrom 25 - 50 ( making a model village in rural Africa ) is transient ( cannever be perfect ; infighting ; hunting ; guns ; the "" dark - side "" of humannature will come back even in Utopia ; i like the flexible hours ; workwhen you want ; accumulate credits ; do manual labor once in a while;start the day with reading , not the end when you are tired ; siesta , fiesta etc . ) no matter how good you are . The girl herself is secondaryto the book - ironic since the book promotes feminism , is written by aguy with a female narrator but a male protagonist , who she is fixatedon and has doubts about . But in the end the Jesus character is stillmale . While the female goes back to Palo Alto and takes an average jobin service of the savior . The Man has the final laugh . Do you favor a better ending",536,1,0.16355032103512598,0.09084887096372915,0.009777864582481121,0.030505716207638853,0.00023255813953491032,0.012479474335561595,0.00023255813953491032,0.021732049461466785,0.01350515352670215,0.00023255813953491032,0.00023255813953491032,0.00023255813953491032,0.00023255813953491032,0.00023255813953491032,0.00023255813953491032,0.00023255813953491032,0.00023255813953491032,0.00023255813953491032,0.00023255813953491032,0.00023255813953491032,0.25044029120672884,0.00023255813953491032,0.00023255813953491032,0.00023255813953491032,0.02729785735678115,0.00023255813953491032,0.00023255813953491032,0.00023255813953491032,0.00023255813953491032,0.00023255813953491032,0.00023255813953491032,0.012591400296798099,0.00023255813953491032,0.00023255813953491032,0.04481137719574827,0.00023255813953491032,0.31362241452891143,0.00023255813953491032,0.00023255813953491032,0.00023255813953491032,0.00023255813953491032,0.00023255813953491032,0.00023255813953491032,0.00023255813953491032,0.00023255813953491032,0.00023255813953491032,0.00023255813953491032,0.00023255813953491032,0.00023255813953491032,0.00023255813953491032,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
51686,1,"Best thus far . This is my favorite of the series thus far . Without wanting to give too much away , this is the book in which you finally learn just exactly why Roland is willing to give up anything and everything ( and clearly has ) just to get to the Dark Tower . King mentions that the Dark Tower series is sort of like his Middle - Earth , where all of his stories originate in some way from this massive odyssey and world , and you see what he means with this book .

Falwell 's unfortunate comments about the tragedy of Sept. 11 , 2001 , I recommend this book to anyone seeking to understand , quot;Why would that guy say that stuff ? quot ; Harding presents an objective , intelligent , perceptive analysis of the way that Fundamentalist language shapes the way in which they relate to the world , and how Jerry Falwell changed that shaping from withdrawal to the active Moral Majority of the 1980s . Harding combs through Falwell 's history and sermons to observe how the language of quot;being born again quot ; affects the listener , showing Falwell 's shift from separatism to political activism . She critiques both Falwell and Falwell 's critics in a fair and keenly insightful way .

51699,1,"Incisive and novel critique - absolutely recommended Colonial Fantasies is a powerfully argued and engaging dissection of colonial psychology , critiques of Orientalism that isolate gender and culture , and the Western feminist adoption of the rescue paradigm . One of Yegenoglu 's incisive arguments is that desire is the nexus in the process of colonial discourse that constitutes the Western subject as well as the possible resistance or interruption of this process . As desire frames the relation between the subject and its other , Yegenoglu argues that the veil interrupts the relation . As a barrier from which the other can see but avoid being seen , the veil is the site at which the colonialist desire is made manifest , but simultaneously displaced ( 62 ) . Her argumentation is lucid and compelling : for the colonial gaze , the veil is both the tantalizing object of desire ( in the fantasy of unveiling ) as well as the b te - noire , because it precludes the climax of the voyeuristic project . The veil therefore frustrates the identity - forming process of the subject - object positioning in colonialist discourse ; the subject can not quite see the object , and its subjectivity thus remains in question . Interestingly , this overtly phallocentric logic of identity forming through scopic penetration has been inherited by Western feminism . As the veil has come to signify the backwardness of Islam and its inherent oppression of women , the visibility of the veil itself comes to embody difference . In this dynamic , the identity of the liberated Western woman is constructed vis- -vis the oppressed Muslim woman ( 102 ) . Since the status of Western women is contingent on the continued representation of Muslim women as oppressed , Yegenoglu reveals that the Western feminist establishment has a vested interest in the exceedingly patriarchal ideology of colonialism . Yegenoglu then exposes the fallacy of assuming the unveiled woman to be normative ; such universal constructions serve particular political ends in outmoded Enlightenment ideology . She argues that unveiling and veiling are both cultural practices particular to certain cultures and historical moments ( 115 ) . This facilitates the deconstruction of the binary by unfixing the poles . In sum , Yegenoglu 's critical analysis of the colonial fantasy has produced a thorough tome sure to provoke further discussion among post - colonial theorists",406,1,0.0012500000000001464,0.0012500000000001464,0.0012500000000001464,0.0012500000000001464,0.0012500000000001464,0.0012500000000001464,0.0012500000000001464,0.30086789074831866,0.0012500000000001464,0.0012500000000001464,0.0012500000000001464,0.06375000000000373,0.0012500000000001464,0.0012500000000001464,0.0012500000000001464,0.0012500000000001464,0.0012500000000001464,0.0012500000000001464,0.0012500000000001464,0.0012500000000001464,0.0012500000000001464,0.0012500000000001464,0.0012500000000001464,0.0012500000000001464,0.0012500000000001464,0.06683482516458857,0.0012500000000001464,0.0012500000000001464,0.0012500000000001464,0.0012500000000001464,0.0012500000000001464,0.0012500000000001464,0.0012500000000001464,0.0012500000000001464,0.0012500000000001464,0.18010342147467018,0.066132305472794,0.0012500000000001464,0.0012500000000001464,0.0012500000000001464,0.0012500000000001464,0.0012500000000001464,0.0012500000000001464,0.2673115571396186,0.0012500000000001464,0.0012500000000001464,0.0012500000000001464,0.0012500000000001464,0.0012500000000001464,0.0012500000000001464,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

51709,1,"Close your eyes and enjoy the ride ! I think some of the previous reviwers with negative opinions are taking this book waaay too seriously . As political thrillers go , this is one of the best of the genre . It 's packed with insider information , from power - mad politicians and the amoral king - makers who advise them , to nerves - of - steel assassins avoiding the meticulous pursuit of the FBI . Granted the premise is implausible : a group of former SEALS assassinate a group of congressmen and senators who the SEALS believe have sold the country down the river ( or , in the Southern vernacular , because "" they needed killin ' "" ) . While one can argue whether the SEALS have the high moral ground in this setting , it does n't detract from the page - turning non - stop action . Like a thrill ride at Disneyland , this book should not be examined too critically .

51724,1,"the only cookbook ( out of hundreds ) that I use weekly . My father was a chef , and although we did not have much money , I was brought up appreciating good , fresh , healthy food as well as cookbooks -- my father had a library of cookbooks , gastronomic dictionaries , even cookbooks in French ( he was trained by a french chef in the 1950's).With that being said , I am obsessed with eating , and occasionally cooking , good food . This cookbook is the one I use over and over again . I have cooked almost every recipe in the book , more than once , which is a true testament to a wonderful cookbook . The beauty of it is that is is simple -- most ingredients are things you would have on - hand . Most recipes are for the novice cook , but can be challenging enough for a true obsessed gourmet .

51745,1,"Irresistible Grace I first saw this book reviewed in the early 1990 's . It aroused a double response of curiosity and suspicion . Like many a cynic I asked myself , "" Now who 's this guy and what 's he spinning ? "" Against my natural inclination to dismiss it , I ordered POG . On receiving it I began reading and found my suspicions confirmed : here was another triumphal and insensitive adherent to the doctrine of the sovereignty of God . Strangely , however , I could n't stop reading . Despite months of scrawling angry counter - arguments in the margins of its pages I was drawn inexplicably to the sensibility of its core premise about God 's delight in being God . To make this story short , I found myself , in the end , exhausted but surrendered to the portrait of God that Piper paints with the full palette of scriptural truth . And finally happy too , with the beginnings of the joy Piper wished for his sons in the Foreword . Salvation history testifies to the fact that a distinguishing evidence of the truth is that it is often hated - at first . The fact that POG eventually had such an unnatural ( or supernatural ) effect on someone like me - initially so inclined to resist and rebuff - speaks more to the validity of this book than if I had joined immediately in the chorus of deserved admiration . This is not a critical analysis of POG ; others have provided that sufficiently on this page . Instead it 's a personal account of the Irresistible Grace that against all nature drew a small and scoffing soul into undeserved open spaces where God 's glory was seen ... and is now sung .",306,1,0.0005555555555556071,0.0005555555555556071,0.0005555555555556071,0.0005555555555556071,0.0005555555555556071,0.0005555555555556071,0.0005555555555556071,0.3125084416678122,0.0005555555555556071,0.0005555555555556071,0.0005555555555556071,0.018366422481664896,0.0005555555555556071,0.0005555555555556071,0.0005555555555556071,0.0005555555555556071,0.0005555555555556071,0.0005555555555556071,0.0005555555555556071,0.0005555555555556071,0.13729765815786746,0.0005555555555556071,0.0005555555555556071,0.0005555555555556071,0.07508623893459633,0.03997487343832102,0.0005555555555556071,0.0005555555555556071,0.0005555555555556071,0.0005555555555556071,0.0005555555555556071,0.0005555555555556071,0.0005555555555556071,0.0005555555555556071,0.0005555555555556071,0.0005555555555556071,0.3335930235762094,0.031353353559320236,0.0005555555555556071,0.0005555555555556071,0.0005555555555556071,0.0005555555555556071,0.02848665485087285,0.0005555555555556071,0.0005555555555556071,0.0005555555555556071,0.0005555555555556071,0.0005555555555556071,0.0005555555555556071,0.0005555555555556071,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

51772,1,"Can you imagine Hell ? These six people can . It 's pretty impressive to think that a book like "" Hiroshima "" was written , and appreciated , less than a year after the atomic bomb was dropped . John Hersey took a bold step in investigating the lives and experiences of those who were on the receiving end of the birth of the Atomic Age . Interviewing six survivors , Hersey assembled a snapshot of what it was like have an atomic bomb dropped on your city . Pure luck and circumstances determine if you survive or not . The color of your clothing means everything . White clothes reflect the heat , while dark clothing absorbs it . Even if you survive the initial blast , what you see next might make you wish you had n't . But human beings are stubborn creatures , and seem to keep going even in the most hellish circumstances . I have been to the Hiroshima Peace Park several times , and have seen the human face of the atomic bomb up close and personal . It is a humbling experience , and one that forever changed my opinions on war as a means of settling disputes . Hersey 's book has a similar impact , being told in such a clinical , observational writing style that you ca n't help but be moved by the reality of it all . My one criticism of "" Hiroshima "" is the cast of characters that Hersey chose to showcase . For some reason , they seem to be largely Christian , including a German Jesuit priest and a Japanese Methodist minister . With Christians being such a tiny percentage of the Japanese population , considerably less than 1 % , the choice to interview Japanese Christians seems a deliberate one . Hersey is telling the largely - Christian US readers , "" See ? They are n't heathen devils . They are Christians , just like you and me . That 's who we dropped the bomb on . That 's who we killed . "" This puts in question the journalistic neutrality of the book , and has Hersey in the light of putting across an agenda instead of simpling reporting what was",383,1,0.24769799052977348,0.00042553191489366857,0.00042553191489366857,0.00042553191489366857,0.00042553191489366857,0.025869569298682508,0.00042553191489366857,0.2675113778318943,0.06233550763840102,0.00042553191489366857,0.00042553191489366857,0.00042553191489366857,0.00042553191489366857,0.00042553191489366857,0.00042553191489366857,0.00042553191489366857,0.00042553191489366857,0.00042553191489366857,0.00042553191489366857,0.00042553191489366857,0.00042553191489366857,0.00042553191489366857,0.00042553191489366857,0.02582231285714406,0.00042553191489366857,0.00042553191489366857,0.00042553191489366857,0.00042553191489366857,0.00042553191489366857,0.02459264179465412,0.00042553191489366857,0.021702127659575476,0.00042553191489366857,0.00042553191489366857,0.05140690031357194,0.021808353308673988,0.2090692113388638,0.00042553191489366857,0.00042553191489366857,0.025588262747912142,0.00042553191489366857,0.00042553191489366857,0.00042553191489366857,0.00042553191489366857,0.00042553191489366857,0.00042553191489366857,0.00042553191489366857,0.00042553191489366857,0.00042553191489366857,0.00042553191489366857,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

51780,1,"Great Concept , Best Low Carb Book I have Seen I bought this book along with Saving Dinner and Saving Dinner for the Holidays last year . I LOVE the concept of having the weekly menu planned out as well as the grocery list put together and ready for shopping . We went through the entire book and I have to say , it really broadened our food horizons as we had been stuck in a rut for a long time with our regular foods . Also , the books really did eliminate a lot of stress by allowing me to know in advance "" What 's for dinner "" and be ready to prepare it . The only cons I can think of would be that the food is not exactly kid friendly , and you will need to be an open minded eater . If you have a lot of people with finicky preferences in your household , this may not be the book for you . Also , our grocery bill for two went up from about $ 75 a week to $ 125 because of the veggies and meats . Good , healthy quality food ingredients , but unfortunately , painful to the wallet . That said , I have NEVER seen a low carb book out there that compares to this one , the food is good , the variety is there , and it takes the low carb lifestyle above and beyond "" bunless burgers "" and eggs and bacon . Overall , I would recommend Leanne 's Saving Dinner books . For the open minded foodie . Or for those weeks that you just want to not worry about dinner and the grocery list . These books are great to have and do offer a good variety of recipes to broaden horizons while removing some stress",313,1,0.2599303036526001,0.00036363636363638356,0.0327756359046155,0.07161460937160934,0.048256629358793914,0.00036363636363638356,0.00036363636363638356,0.00036363636363638356,0.00036363636363638356,0.00036363636363638356,0.00036363636363638356,0.00036363636363638356,0.14496338863725264,0.00036363636363638356,0.00036363636363638356,0.00036363636363638356,0.00036363636363638356,0.00036363636363638356,0.00036363636363638356,0.00036363636363638356,0.00036363636363638356,0.00036363636363638356,0.00036363636363638356,0.00036363636363638356,0.00036363636363638356,0.04135602419738292,0.00036363636363638356,0.00036363636363638356,0.00036363636363638356,0.00036363636363638356,0.00036363636363638356,0.00036363636363638356,0.15244646841665907,0.00036363636363638356,0.00036363636363638356,0.00036363636363638356,0.23338421318835845,0.00036363636363638356,0.00036363636363638356,0.00036363636363638356,0.00036363636363638356,0.00036363636363638356,0.00036363636363638356,0.00036363636363638356,0.00036363636363638356,0.00036363636363638356,0.00036363636363638356,0.00036363636363638356,0.00036363636363638356,0.00036363636363638356,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I also attended the Guerilla Business School , a $ 2500 intensive .

Getting into a better mindset with regards to prosperity is fundamentally an issue of breaking down old programs and replacing them with new ones .

51793,1,"Mmmmmm ..... Scrumptious ! And the Memories ....... Having patronized Boulevard all but twice , I still feel the need to write a review . You have to understand that those of us "" Back East "" think that California food is understated and so easy . Now not being a huge chef myself , but cooking a bit and doing some experimentation and emulation of real chef 's recipes ( my fave restaurants being of course , Boulevard , and back east , 2941 , Le Tire Bouchon , Maestro , Citronelle DC , Galileo , Inn at Little Washington , etc . ) . I have no clue where I 'd get some of the ingredients in this cookbook , other than maybe the San Francisco Ferry building 's fabulous farmer 's market ( another real SF treat ! ) . But to be real , we have to sometimes improvise on ingredients . Do what you can with what you have locally and you might be surprised . Now I was spoiled with a fabulous waiter at Boulevard who asked the chef to let me know what was in one of the recipes and I have her handwriting -- just ingredients , no measurements . And yes , I 've been able to improvise , and her very treasured scribe is in my own personal collection of "" recipes . "" But nothing is better than going to the restaurant .

51835,1,"Jules Gets Four Stars Suzanne Brockmann is an unbelievable writer and her stories always draw me in . The "" mystery "" portion of the story and the romance between Jane and Cosmo left a little to be desired . I really did n't understand why Jane had to have her alternative personality as Mercedes and Cosmo was a little to soft for keeping up the hardened SEAL persona . These particular characters seemed a bit empty compared to Jules and Robin , who clearly stole the show in this book . As a matter of fact , of the different plots and stories going on in this book , Jules ' was the best . It was not only very well - written and sweet , but even as a hetrosexual female , I could identify with Jules and how he felt at times because what was happening to him , happens to all of us , whether you are in a gay or straight relationship . I am really hoping that Jules either gets his own book , or has more appearances in future novels where he does find true happiness . I do share Ms. Brockmann 's opinion when it comes to differences in appearance , nationality , sexual orientation , etc . and I really like how she includes this in her books . As far as I 'm concerned love is love , no matter what and it 's portrayed beautifully here . Please Ms. Brockmann , do n't allow the naysayers to steer you away from this storyline , it 's a very good one",271,1,0.06308826230631202,0.00048780487804881133,0.00048780487804881133,0.00048780487804881133,0.00048780487804881133,0.00048780487804881133,0.00048780487804881133,0.00048780487804881133,0.00048780487804881133,0.00048780487804881133,0.00048780487804881133,0.00048780487804881133,0.00048780487804881133,0.00048780487804881133,0.00048780487804881133,0.00048780487804881133,0.14039085758426575,0.00048780487804881133,0.00048780487804881133,0.00048780487804881133,0.00048780487804881133,0.06300855970123083,0.00048780487804881133,0.00048780487804881133,0.00048780487804881133,0.00048780487804881133,0.00048780487804881133,0.00048780487804881133,0.00048780487804881133,0.00048780487804881133,0.00048780487804881133,0.00048780487804881133,0.03311963487999785,0.00048780487804881133,0.2400393575954561,0.00048780487804881133,0.43888991329858973,0.00048780487804881133,0.00048780487804881133,0.00048780487804881133,0.00048780487804881133,0.00048780487804881133,0.00048780487804881133,0.00048780487804881133,0.00048780487804881133,0.00048780487804881133,0.00048780487804881133,0.00048780487804881133,0.00048780487804881133,0.00048780487804881133,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

51844,1,"Great Detailed Tutorial For Those New To Reporting Services Many reviewers of this book have given it high marks because it is a terrific tutorial and that introduces most of the crucial techniques for writing great reports . I would agree as I have reporting experience with MS - Access and Crystal and this book helped me get up to speed quickly . If you like learning in a step - by - step fashion right out of a book - this is the book!The bad reviews came from people that were looking for more of a reference type book . While this book is not a bad reference it does fall short as a reference book . For example , one reviewer brought up that the ability to shade alternating detail rows of a report does not appear to be easy to find in this book . I would agree with that . I was unable to go into the index and find a quick solution in this book . If you want a better reference book try the WROX book , Professional SQL Server 2005 Reporting Services . That book is not as good as this book from a step - by - step standpoint but it is a better reference when you need a quick solutions . For example , page 272 has code on how to shade alternating rows - they call it Greenbar Reports . It was not easy to find in this book either . How many people would look up "" Greenbar Reports "" in the reference ? I was looking into "" shading alternative rows "" . I just happened to stumble upon it . I bought both books together . Of course there is lots of overlap but between the two that is all you will need to become a pro at Reporting Services . Reporting Services could use a COOKBOOK - style text like they have for Access and other programming languages . Those types of books have served me well over the years .

St. Angelicus students had to find their own lodgings . Fred Fairly had taken the science tripos and received a first class degree . He came from a rectory and so his material wants were limited . He was used to making do . At the end of his first year as a junior fellow he wanted to tell his father he was no longer a Christian . Fred knew the country was not a place of peace . The Rectory had been built in 1830 . Daisy Saunders wanted to know how the human body worked and applied for nursing training . She was seventeen and her mother had died recently and she was free to live away from home . Daisy , now known as Saunders , was a probationer during her first year . She was told to keep her eye on James Elder , an attempted suicide via the Thames . It was January 1912 . To all the patients , except for the dying , food was of paramount importance . Elder refused to eat . The constable had said he was a gentleman . He asked Daisy if the incident had appeared in the press . For arranging for a notice about Elder 's conduct in the newpaper , Daisy was dismissed . Fred Fairly and Daisy were in an accident with bicycles . A Good Samaritan thought they were married to each other and put them to bed together in the spare room to regain their health . Fred was enchanted and afterwards he looked everywhere to locate Daisy . The kindness of the Wrayburns , the Samaritans , gave Daisy a place to stay in Cambridge . She would do work in the house in exchange for room and board . She had traveled to Cambridge to find work in a private hospital . Happily Daisy was employed at the mental hospital and Fred found her again at the Wrayburns ' . They went for a walk in the country . Fred asked Daisy to marry him . Mr. Wrayburn told Daisy that Fred could not be a junior fellow if he married . In the trial , pertaining to the accident , the journalist , who had accompanied Daisy to Cambridge , was able to identify the man who drove the horse cart wildly causing the accident . When the heart is broken , efficiency is impaired . There was some suggestion in the testimony of the journalist that Daisy had been or would have been used , but for the happening of the accident . Daisy had to leave the Wrayburns and Cambridge because of what was disclosed in court . Leaving her lodgings , she was free at last to cry over the hurt she had caused Fred . Daisy and Fred passed each other on her way to the train station . We do not know what action , if any , resulted . Both of the young characters are portrayed as having beautiful consciences . The writing is elegant .",539,1,0.21011343021471346,0.07504301125616754,0.00032786885245906177,0.00032786885245906177,0.00032786885245906177,0.00032786885245906177,0.00032786885245906177,0.08977961810441103,0.00032786885245906177,0.00032786885245906177,0.00032786885245906177,0.016722058355609373,0.00032786885245906177,0.00032786885245906177,0.00032786885245906177,0.00032786885245906177,0.00032786885245906177,0.00032786885245906177,0.00032786885245906177,0.041046830631878375,0.00032786885245906177,0.00032786885245906177,0.00032786885245906177,0.05112120313321719,0.03430353033894091,0.00032786885245906177,0.00032786885245906177,0.00032786885245906177,0.00032786885245906177,0.050504325248321304,0.00032786885245906177,0.022070538522710348,0.1457413228141696,0.00032786885245906177,0.054612189572086446,0.00032786885245906177,0.00032786885245906177,0.00032786885245906177,0.06300284436657325,0.00032786885245906177,0.00032786885245906177,0.0334067549703027,0.00032786885245906177,0.00032786885245906177,0.00032786885245906177,0.10072906378237222,0.00032786885245906177,0.00032786885245906177,0.00032786885245906177,0.00032786885245906177,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

I agree with the other reviewers that the problem sets are challenging , the text is clearly written , and the material relates well back to current research issues . If you are a graduate student considering getting another reference to help you through your organic chemistry graduate program , get this book before you try "" Advanced Organic Chemistry : Structure and Mechanisms "" by Carey and Sundberg . I expect that "" Modern Physcial Organic Chemistry "" will become a staple to most chemist 's shelves similar to that of a CRC Handbook or "" Advanced Organic Chemistry "" by March .",174,1,0.0009523809523810507,0.0009523809523810507,0.0009523809523810507,0.04733979041890376,0.046150122802196776,0.0009523809523810507,0.0009523809523810507,0.0009523809523810507,0.0009523809523810507,0.0009523809523810507,0.0009523809523810507,0.0009523809523810507,0.0009523809523810507,0.0009523809523810507,0.0009523809523810507,0.0009523809523810507,0.0009523809523810507,0.0009523809523810507,0.04857142857143176,0.0009523809523810507,0.0009523809523810507,0.0009523809523810507,0.11260660101839255,0.10023469116501504,0.0009523809523810507,0.0009523809523810507,0.0009523809523810507,0.0009523809523810507,0.0009523809523810507,0.0009523809523810507,0.0009523809523810507,0.0009523809523810507,0.24824732868084423,0.0009523809523810507,0.0009523809523810507,0.0009523809523810507,0.32200593632759633,0.0009523809523810507,0.0009523809523810507,0.0009523809523810507,0.0009523809523810507,0.0009523809523810507,0.0009523809523810507,0.0009523809523810507,0.0009523809523810507,0.0009523809523810507,0.034844101015615477,0.0009523809523810507,0.0009523809523810507,0.0009523809523810507,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1
51863,1,"An excellent description on the role of the state This is an excellent book on the role of the state after a revolution , how it will wither away , and what a society should look like ( or try to mould itself into ) after the revolution . Lenin , drawing on the works of Marx and Engels extensively , refutes many claims by both the Anarchists and opportunists on the role of the state , and corrects many common errors believed about the Marxist road to Socialism . This is a thoroughly informative read .

51869,1,"Contemporary English Bible : low cost edition My comments are not on the CEV translation , but rather on this particular edition . Among all low cost editions of the whole Bible ( Protestant canon ) , this one is outstanding in three respects:1 ) it has the most extensive annotations ( footnotes , introductions and outlines for each book of the Bible , and study helps ) of any . They are not as extensive as many full - fledged study Bibles , of course , but it is a fraction of the price.2 ) these annotations appear to have been designed to be solely descriptive , not reflecting any particular theological or scholarly bias . Thus , this edition can be used by persons with quite a wide range of theological orientations . 3 ) it has the largest print size .

51917,1,"Great book This book is the best book on Rand 's esthetics I 've ever read ; in fact , it is the only book on the topic that I know of . It is refreshing to see that the authors are objective and critical ; they are not slavish cultists savoring every last word written by Rand . They approach the material with critical distance and do an excellent job of placing Rand 's work in the larger history of esthetic theory . They demolish abstract art , and devote considerable energy to discussing Rand 's definition of art . They even propose their own individual alternatives ! If anything shows independence , it is this willingness to debate the differences between the authors of the same work ! Remarkable ! The world of Rand commentary is filled to the brim with sectarianism and partisanship . That is clear just by reading one of the reviews here , by people who are devotees of certain quot;scholars quot ; who do nothing but repeat the catechism . They take swipes at genuinely independent work anytime it is published ; that is why they hate this book . Because it is independent - minded . Judge for yourself .

51920,1,"Creepy and Fascinating This is a sci - fi novel about the end of the world . Every single adult on the planet died . THere are a couple of kids living in a house alone . So begins the Fire - Us trilogy , fascinating , scary , and intriguing . The story is really interesting - I mean slap in your face , give - me - more , I LOVE THIS intersting . A couple of the images were really disturbing , though , like the fact that Hunter had to move the skeletons out of his way at the supermarket . The kids in the story are fascinating , and the Teacher 's scarpbook - thing was so . . . wierd that it was actually kind of scary . Then Angerman is introduced . He 's really messed up , but I get the idea that he knows something about the virus ( Fire - us ) that the others do n't . This makes him an amazing character , and even if you do n't like the story its worth reading the sequel just to find out what happens to him and his battered dummy . I really love this series , though some of the descriptions might be a little too much for younger readers . Well worth anyone who is into sci - fi and apocalypse , as I was at the time . P.S. I read this book five months ago and I still remember all of the characters and their names and quirks .

51921,1,"Mr. Explainer does it again When I read Ron Penton 's first book , Data Structures for Game Programming , I could n't wait to see what he did next . MUD Game Programming lived up to all of my expectations , and indeed surpassed them . The author has an extraordinary knack for making complex topics understandable -- and , equally important , making them interesting . Reading MUD Game Programming is like having a friendly , cheerful expert sitting down next to you and showing you the tricks of the trade . Instead of just telling you what to do , he explains the thinking behind the decisions that go into the design of a complex program such as a MUD server , enabling you to make the decisions that are right for your own project , which might not be the same . You end up with not just knowledge but understanding . I highly recommend MUD Game Programming to people doing any type of network - based multiplayer programming , not just traditional MUDs .

51925,1,"A Reassuring Read What I like about this book is that the tone is just right for a self - conscious preteen boy who has more questions than answers but is too embarrassed to ask anybody . Leave this book in his room or in the bathroom without making a big deal of it , and I bet he 'll take a look inside . Some books are so clinical ; others do n't provide enough information . This one gets it right -- at least for your basic seventh or eighth grader . As someone who has been writing for girls for years , I 'm always curious about what is out there for boys , and I like Daldry 's style .

51926,1,"Highly Recommended HACCP is the acronym for Hazard Analysis of Critical Control Points . This text , by Arduser and Brown is the be all and end all on the topic - in my view . It even comes with a companion CD - ROM that contains all forms from the book in Adobe Acrobat ( PDF ) and MS Word format . This is a major time saver when it comes to preparing and administering the required tests to staff members and the newly hired . The comprehensive 530 + page text covers everything I can think of that relates to food safety in restaurants and other eateries . It is designed to teach food service managers and their employees the specifics of food safety in accordance with the FDA Food Code . This excellent training manual is in large print format that makes it easy to read . The writing is easy to understand and the authors were careful to explain key concepts and terms so that even a novice can study it alone . The seven comprehensive chapters in the manual cover the following topics : Hazards to Food Safety ; Factors Affecting Food - Born Illness ; Food Safety Regulations ; Following The Flow of Food ; HACCP ; and the Facility Plan . These are followed by an extremely helpful Glossary of terms . The Appendix includes all forms needed to meet the FDA requirements and to run an efficient and safe establishment . Included are checklists , signage , compliance checklists , and equipment cleaning charts , allergen - control program worksheet along with job descriptions for personnel . There is even a Certificate of Completion to certify that staff members have taken and passed the required tests ( included).With the rise in reports of food - borne illnesses and deaths it is essential that every food service operation adhere to the regulations and safety procedures at all times .

51937,1,"Anna Anderson WAS Grand Duchess Anastasia of Russia Anna Anderson/ Anastasia I have researched this great mystery for some time now and I have concluded that the woman , Anna Anderson , could not have been an imposter . Not only did she never give any signs of playing a part , but she was in posession of all sorts of little facts and information that no one on the outside could have known . She knew of Gleb Botkin 's paintings before he even came to see her , she knew exactly what she and her sister Tatiana had been doing while WWI was being declared for Russia ( this was confirmed by Dr. Rudnev who was visiting Russia and saw Anastasia and Tatiana at that time ) , she had intimate knowledge of every single royal house in Europe , and could recognize her royal cousins- sight unseen- by their voices alone . One must wonder how a demented Polish farming girl could do that . Aside from just her character , there the many scars and lacerations on her body , as well as the bunions on her feet identical to Anastasia and the cautorized mole on the shoulder which was verified to have been on the young Anastasia as well by a standart officer who did not even support Anna Anderson 's claim . For over six decades , Royal cousins and friends to Anastasia would try and trip this woman up with tricks . They would misstate things just to see if she would catch them and she always would . It is virtually impossible for someone to go 65 years without ever being caught in a mistake . Anna had people such as Alexei Volkov and Alexadra Tegleva in tears after having met her because they were so touched . No one has ever yet attempted to explain why Ambassador Zahle and Grand Duke Andrew 's papers are still kept secret , why Doris Wingender touched up her photographs in court , or why Pierre Gilliard had his scandalous midnight ' burning ' of evidence . To this day , anthropologists who compare Anna Anderson 's face , ears , and handwriting specimens to the young girl she claimed to be declare with certainty that the "" two "" women are the same . The Franziska Schanzkowska story is clearly a lie from beginning to end . Anna Anderson was several inches shorter than Franziska Schanzkowska , wore a size shoe three inches smaller , was not mentally insane like Franziska , she spoke a bad German while FS spoke German as her first language , and could understand Russian . The Schanzkowska siblings did not understand a word of Russian when spoken to them . AA clearly understood Russian . Anderson also gave birth to a child . There is no record of Franziska ever having a child . Recent documents also show that Schanzkowska was never injured in the grenade explosion which supposedly infliced the wounds on Anna Anderson 's body . The DNA tests have won the hour , but I hope the future will see the release of Ambassador Zahle and GD Andrew 's papers to cast even more doubt on this . Richard Schweitzer 's switch theory is very probable given the doubts about the identification with Schanzkowska as well as the security measures which were not that good at Martha Jefferson Hospital during the complicated court battle between Marina Botkin Schweitzer and the Russian Nobiltiy Association . According to Massie 's book , one researcher was even allowed access to the intestinal tissue during this time . Is it reasonable that the Royal families would ignore the fact that Anna Anderson was about to recieve recognition as the Tsar 's daughter after they had been fighting to disprove her all her life ? In any case , the body of Anastasia is still missing , although in Russia there lies a body under the coffin which reads ' Anastasia ' measuring 5'7 , despite the fact that Anastasia was the shortest of her sisters . If this is n't reason enough to be suspicious that there is some sort of agenda , I do n't know what is . I 'm afraid however that the body lies in the ashes spread over Castle Seeon under the stone which reads , "" Anastasia Manahan 1901 - 1984 "" . To end this , I will quote Empress Alexandra 's best friend ( aside from Anna Vyrobouva ) Lili Dehn , who met Anna Anderson in 1957 ( ? ) and declared , "" Do n't bother to tell me she has read these things in books . I have recognized her physically and intuitively , through signs which do not decieve . What can I say after having known her ? I could not have been mistaken . ""This is to explain my conviction that Anna Anderson was Anastasia . I think there is something about the DNA we do not know . The File on the Tsar- 2002 edition ... p. 362 ' Nearly fifty years ago , Anna Anderson told a story about a sketch she and her sister had put on to amuse their parents during their confinement in Tobolsk . She played a male part , she ' recalled ' , and and had to borrow a man 's dressing - gown . At a pivotal moment in the play , a freak draught made the dressing gown billow up around their thighs , revealing that she was wearing the tsar 's long - johns- against the bitter cold of the Siberian winter . The family , said Anna Anderson , had hooted with laughter . The only witnesses from the imperial household who would have been present at that scene , and who are known to have survived , were the two family tutors - both foreigners . One was the English tutor , Sydney Gibbes , and his memoirs were published for the first time in 1975 . They include this account of an incident during amatuer theatricals in Tobolsk . "" The cast , "" Gibbes wrote , "" had its happiest night with an Edwardian farce by Henry Grattan , called ' Packing Up ' , ... Anastasia took the male part ... at the end of the farce the ' Husband ' had to turn his back , open his Dressing - gown as if to take it off- Anastasia used an old one of mine ... but a draught got under the gown and whisked its tail up to the middle of her back , showing her sturdy legs and bottom encased Emperor Jaguer 's underwear ... ' So far as exhaustive research can establish , only Anna Anderson had ever before told this vivid ancedote , in private and three decades before the Gibbes memoirs appeared . If Anderson was a phoney , as the seemingly damning DNA evidence now tells us , how did she know the story ? That was one of the myriad puzzles that believers in Anna Anderson had to confront when the scientists delivered their verdict . Ian Lilburn , a research historian and the only observer to attend every session of the "" Anastasia "" appeal process in the German courts , had a calmer response than some . "" I think , "" he said , knowing he sounded like a Luddite and Romanov flat - earther , "" there is something we do n't know about the DNA . "" Maybe after reading you can understand why some of us do n't believe the DNA was Anna Anderson 's , and why we do n't believe she was the tall , size ' 36 shoe wearing Franziska Schanzkowska who could not have had such exclusive info if she were an imposter .",1322,1,0.09465395295177548,0.03919102730967957,0.00015748031496064702,0.00015748031496064702,0.00015748031496064702,0.008178716885745153,0.00015748031496064702,0.09650786089002067,0.00015748031496064702,0.00015748031496064702,0.00015748031496064702,0.00015748031496064702,0.13677524317695228,0.00015748031496064702,0.00015748031496064702,0.00015748031496064702,0.00015748031496064702,0.00015748031496064702,0.00015748031496064702,0.014629014617827672,0.25270297413805337,0.00015748031496064702,0.00015748031496064702,0.00015748031496064702,0.00015748031496064702,0.00015748031496064702,0.00015748031496064702,0.00015748031496064702,0.00015748031496064702,0.00015748031496064702,0.00015748031496064702,0.00015748031496064702,0.07815214056399925,0.00015748031496064702,0.00015748031496064702,0.00015748031496064702,0.09038138162880906,0.016610434421389597,0.00015748031496064702,0.00015748031496064702,0.04804256536219701,0.0311785332260099,0.00015748031496064702,0.00015748031496064702,0.00015748031496064702,0.08716938317399728,0.00015748031496064702,0.00015748031496064702,0.00015748031496064702,0.00015748031496064702,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

51967,1,"The Peak of Storytelling Most people are in awe of the "" classic . "" However , a book does not pick that title on the whim of a professor of arcane texts , rather a book gains such when it constantly and consistently speaks about the human condition . Classics do not only thrill and teach , they also live . The Count of Monte Cristo by Alexandre Dumas is a classic . This tale of accusal , love , betrayal , imprisonment , redemption , and retribution , defies genre . Recounting the plot serves no purpose , so I will simply surmise that most readers focus on vengeance at the expense of reward . Edmond Dantes could not have desired living just to kill those who wronged him ; he expected to return to those who remained faithful . Here Dumas , using Dantes , Sinbad , Albert and Abbe Busoni , championed a nonviolent stoicism which exposes a person to death to experience life . The Count of Monte Cristo is a vivid potrayal of French life after the Revolution , an epic account of a man 's quest for closure and an inspiration for the Shawshank Redemption .

51968,1,"a real mystery for grown - ups At 37 , John Wade was Lieutenant Governor of Minnesota . At 40 , he ran for the U.S. Senate . He was heavily favored to win . At 41 , he was n't just beaten in the primary , he was crushed --- "" loser by landslide . ""What happened?John Wade had a secret . As secrets will , it came out at the worst possible time . And , suddenly , he was no longer a rising star --- he was a war criminal , a killer of babies , a man to be shunned . His secret was My Lai . The Vietnam War is now so far from us , and American history --- especially the history of a war we lost --- is so sketchily taught , and some of you are so very young that I really ought to take a minute here and , in quick brushstrokes , relate what happened in a little Vietnam village on March 16 , 1968.Better idea : let Tim O'Brien tell it . He arrived in Vietnam a year later , and served as a foot soldier there for a year . Got wounded , got traumatized , the whole deal . Here 's his account : At approximately 7:30 on the morning , a company of roughly 115 American soldiers was inserted by helicopter just outside the village of My Lai . They met no resistance . No enemy . No incoming fire . Still , for the next four hours , Charlie Company killed whatever could be killed . They killed chickens . They killed dogs and cattle . They killed people , too . Lots of people . Women , infants , teen - agers , old men . The United States Army 's Criminal Investigation Division compiled a list of 343 fatalities and an independent Army inquiry led by Lieut . Gen. William R. Peers estimated that the death count may have exceeded 400 . At the Son My Memorial , a large tablet lists 504 names . According to Col . William Wilson , one of the original Army investigators , "" The crimes visited on the inhabitants of Son My Village included individual and group acts of murder , rape , sodomy , maiming , assault on noncombatants and the mistreatment and killing of detainees . ""Eventually , after a cover - up that lasted more than a year and after the massacre made nationwide headlines , the Army 's Criminal Investigation Division produced sufficient evidence to charge 30 men with war crimes . Of these , only a single soldier --- First Lieut . William Laws Calley , Jr. --- was ever convicted or spent time in prison . Found guilty of the premeditated murder of "" not less than "" 22 civilians , Calley was sentenced to life at hard labor , but after legal appeals and sentence reductions , his ultimate jail time amounted to three days in a stockade and four and a half months in prison . Terrible , terrible . ( And ironic : Seymour Hersh , who broke the My Lai story , now writes about the Iraq War for The New Yorker . ) But in fiction , O'Brien does n't play judge and jury . John Wade may have been at My Lai and done terrible things there , but he found a way to live with his shame . And here 's the remarkable thing --- Tim O'Brien bends over backward to see it Wade 's way . What I tell you now may seem like a plot "" spoiler . "" It 's not . "" In the Lake of the Woods "" is a mystery --- maybe even a thriller --- but it 's totally innovative in form . That is , we know right off that something happened . The first question is : What happened ? And then a gloomier question : Who did it?What we know : After the primary defeat , John Wade and his wife Kathy retreat to a cabin in the Lake of the Woods , a part of Northern Minnesota so remote that there 's nothing but water and islands between it and Canada . Thirty - six hours later , Kathy disappears . Did she flee?Did she drown?Did her husband --- reliving his Vietnam experience --- kill her and dump her body into the lake?Not easy questions . And O'Brien does n't answer them : "" I tried to make each hypothesis plausible . John may have killed Kathy . Or Kathy may have run off with someone else . Or maybe she simply drowned . Or got lost in that vast wilderness . I believed in each hypothesis as I wrote it . I inserted evidence to support each hypothesis --- just as life itself gives us contradictory evidence about a great many things . But in the end , it 's all a mystery , insoluble , beyond certainty . ""And to make it more mysterious , O'Brien tells the story from multiple perspectives . Offers testimony from many people . Cites historical documents . And then amps up the uncertainly by giving Wade a hobby --- magic . And maybe that 's what it comes down to --- an ungainly kid , an abusive father , a need for approval that never got satisfied . As O'Brien writes:""A fat little kid doing magic in front of a stand - up mirror . ' Hey , kiddo , that 's a good one , ' his father could 've said , but for reasons unknown , reasons mysterious , the words never got spoken . He had wanted to be loved . And to be loved he had practiced deception . He had hidden the bad things . He had tricked up his own life . Only for love . Only to be loved . ""Too simple ? A clue that takes you away from the solution ? Could be : O'Brien is that good . ( He won the National Book Award for "" Going After Cacciato "" . The New York Times named The Things They Carried as one of the best books of the year in 1990 --- and chose "" In the Lake of the Woods "" for that list four years later.)This much is sure : You start "" In the Lake of the Woods "" expecting one kind of book and quickly get another , darker , scarier book . You find yourself thinking "" God , this is awful , "" even as you read faster and faster . You cringe at what Wade might have done , wince for what might have been done to him .

51980,1,"Really the Last Prophet This rare book details Aleister Crowley 's ascension as the prophet of a new Aeon , the Aeon of Horus . Out of all the Aleister Crowley books in mass market format , this stood out in memory years after I read it as one of Crowley 's most disturbing works . In fact , I questioned my new faith in Crowley 's religion Thelema reading this book ; this was for real and not a joke . After contemplating , I thought it would be worth it stick with this because witchcraft is now a cool thing amongst today 's youth and Crowley was a famous early form of witchcraft as we know it today . This is serious stuff , I would n't mess around with this unless you are interested in the occult . It should be noted that real life ritual magick as described in these type of works really do work ; I did a ritual from Necronomicon and Lesser Key of Solomon to help with a college Astronomy course- I got a respectable C grade when I close to failing with a D- .

It 's not my burner ( as another reviewer suggested , implying that people should learn to read ) , as it 's brand new and does n't require the firmware upgrade they mention .

52028,2,"Told by company that it would take up to four weeks ! I am the type of person that ALWAYS buys the extra warranty on whatever I purchase . However , I started reading the reviews on this company and many people reported that it was four weeks and counting and they still had n't received their refund check . I was astonished . I contacted N.E.W. myself and asked them about this . With no shame or embarrassment on the part of the customer service reps , I was informed that if I did everything by email , it would take AT LEAST 15 business days ( that 's three weeks ! ) to receive my refund check AFTER I sent them the warrantied item . If I had them send me a pre - paid label for the defective item instead of using my own printer , it would take a week for me to receive and at least a week for them to receive the covered item . In other words , it would take no less than four weeks to receive the replacement check and possibly up to eight weeks ! I cancelled the contract immediately . It is just not worth it when you really do the math to purchase this contract . I would recommend buying a product from a company that first makes a quality product and then back it up with a good warranty and gives good customer service such as Grado , Sennheiser or Koss . But stay away from these people ; that 's my feeling and my advice .",270,0,0.08993410317626707,0.027400909061821285,0.06437860357844942,0.11663712686208393,0.00041666666666670806,0.049766206500578385,0.00041666666666670806,0.00041666666666670806,0.00041666666666670806,0.00041666666666670806,0.06968592559344253,0.06248074330047375,0.00041666666666670806,0.00041666666666670806,0.07644204707977417,0.00041666666666670806,0.10558896244538449,0.00041666666666670806,0.06291666666667182,0.00041666666666670806,0.00041666666666670806,0.00041666666666670806,0.00041666666666670806,0.00041666666666670806,0.00041666666666670806,0.00041666666666670806,0.00041666666666670806,0.00041666666666670806,0.00041666666666670806,0.00041666666666670806,0.00041666666666670806,0.00041666666666670806,0.00041666666666670806,0.00041666666666670806,0.00041666666666670806,0.00041666666666670806,0.05814042916587697,0.00041666666666670806,0.00041666666666670806,0.00041666666666670806,0.00041666666666670806,0.00041666666666670806,0.00041666666666670806,0.00041666666666670806,0.00041666666666670806,0.17276576682327216,0.02844584307923577,0.00041666666666670806,0.00041666666666670806,0.00041666666666670806,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0

52065,2,"The worst brand I 've tried . I 've got a LITE - ON DVDRW SOHW-1673S burner ( Revision JS02 ) in my fast G4 Mac running OS X Tiger and burning with Toast Titanium 7 . Although my burner is nominally 16X - capable , it only burns at about 6X in my setup , probably due to the slow ( ATA 33 ) bus it 's on . I 've used a number of different brands of 8X and 16X disks , both + R and -R , and have had a verification failure rate of less than 2 % -- so few , in fact , that I often do n't bother verifying video DVD 's anymore when burning TDK or Maxell discs . ( I always verify data DVD 's , since errors in those are not ignorable . ) But with Memorex , I 've gotten about 20 % failures , including a couple of aborted burns ! In one case , the disc had a blank band between two burned ones ! The Memorex discs I 'm referring to have Manufacturer ID "" CMC MAG , AM3 "" .

52067,2,"Unacceptable This model was intended as a replacement for my not - very - old and yet quite functional Panasonic PM - series stereo . This is the kind of thing that happens when you browse Amazon while drunk late at night . Unfortunately , with the exception of a very slight advantage in audio quality , the Sony is in all respects inferior ; ergonomics , appearance , and above all , FM reception , which is laughably poor . Do not buy this stereo if you expect a quality receiver . Hiss abounds , several local stations I heard previously are now unreachable , and to top it off , Sony has stuck with their time - honored habit of using proprietary connectors , so when I went to plug in an after - market antenna to get better reception , I found a weird little plug that I had n't noticed when I put the damned thing together . Grrr . So now I 'm going to sell this thing and buy a nice new Panasonic with the proceeds .

52213,2,"My PC is now dead , and Netgear does n't care During the installation of the software on my PC running Windows 2000 Server , the installation program froze my PC completely . I had to turn off the PC , and now it does nothing when I turn it on . The lights on the front light up , but nothing happens at all . I called Netgear , waited on hold for 15 minutes , and then was connected to a gentleman whose English was not very good . I explained my problem about 5 times before he seemed to get it . He told me that the problem is that the product is not compatible with Win 2000 Server . I told him that I had never before encountered a piece of software that ran on 2000 Pro , but not 2000 Server ( perhaps there are some ) , but he insisted that this was the case . I explained that , typically , installation programs that encounter and incompatible operating system would display a message to the user , and exit , rather than freezing and disabling the computer , but he held firm , and advised me that there was nothing he could do to help , and that he recommended that I contact my computer vendor so that they could restore my initial configuration . I went around and around with this fellow , then finally asked for his supervisor . After another 15 minutes on hold , another guy came on the line , who was pretty fluent in English . He explained his understanding of the situation , which was still wrong , and I explained the whole thing again to him . He had me turn the computer on and off , which of course I had already done several times , and check the monitor connection . After this analysis , he determined that the situation could not possibly have been the result of the frozen software installation that occurred just prior to it , and must be some other problem with my PC that had previously been working perfectly , that , coincidently , occurred at the exact same time as the software freeze . I expressed skepticism towards this explanation , and asked him if he would believe that if it was his PC . He said that absolutely he would , and reassured me that there was NO POSSIBLE WAY , ( emphasis his ) that his software could have caused these symptoms . Since I understood that it would be difficult for him to actually fix a computer in this state over the phone , I suggested that I could take it to a local technician , and send Netgear the bill for repairing my system . He declined that offer . So , at the end of the day , I 'm left with a dead PC , but , according to Netgear , a perfectly good wireless card and installation CD . No more Netgear for me , thank you !",518,0,0.00030303030303033664,0.00030303030303033664,0.00030303030303033664,0.00030303030303033664,0.00030303030303033664,0.00030303030303033664,0.08314977425866468,0.00030303030303033664,0.00030303030303033664,0.00030303030303033664,0.013835545206592423,0.015454545454543982,0.16839628693389114,0.00030303030303033664,0.029717236519225657,0.00030303030303033664,0.12606101755956525,0.00030303030303033664,0.030606060606063266,0.00030303030303033664,0.00030303030303033664,0.00030303030303033664,0.18309746745220548,0.00030303030303033664,0.00030303030303033664,0.00030303030303033664,0.07097373793963606,0.00030303030303033664,0.00030303030303033664,0.00030303030303033664,0.00030303030303033664,0.00030303030303033664,0.00030303030303033664,0.00030303030303033664,0.00030303030303033664,0.00030303030303033664,0.00030303030303033664,0.03060606060606277,0.00030303030303033664,0.00030303030303033664,0.00030303030303033664,0.00030303030303033664,0.00030303030303033664,0.00030303030303033664,0.018707376965071926,0.15503833896756966,0.06314443031878537,0.00030303030303033664,0.00030303030303033664,0.00030303030303033664,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0

52233,2,"Barely gets the job done ... My company car has a built - in GPS unit and I have gotten to like it , sort - of . I have gotten lost in a rental car trolling around Silicon Valley enough to get a portable GPS unit . After some research , the Garmin iQue 3600 is what I ended up with and I paid about $ 700 . The unique feature of this portable GPS unit is that a PalmPilot comes integrated into the package . I use a PalmPilot , so this GPS unit replaces my PalmV. Installation was quite awkward , and getting it up and running was a chore . I got the thing synced up and some maps loaded and have been using it for several months now . It does do the job , fitfully , and has several glaring issues . Most irritating , the Palm function and the GPS function are not seamlessly integrated . If an address is entered in the Palm part and then route to this address is selected , the iQue 3600 makes you find the location . But the address from the Palm section does n't transfer cleanly into the find section and you must retype the address . I 'm left - handed and graffiti has NEVER worked for me all my letters are drawn backward . The GPS can be engaged as soon as it recognizes where you want to go , but my unit takes a good 5 - 10 minutes to find the satellites when first exposed to sky . This means that I must have a good idea what to do for the first 5 - 10 minutes . Sometimes I just drive randomly until the GPS locks in and starts to issue navigation orders . Also , the antenna must be deployed to get any GPS reception and must be forward enough in the windshield to see sky . This is OK , except that the iQue 3600 does n't tell you that the antenna has not been deployed . The iQue 3600 does not work propped up on the passenger seat so a 5 pound holder is necessary to hold the unit on the dashboard . If the antenna is not deployed , the iQue 3600 simply does n't navigate and does n't tell you why . Worse , it acts stupid by going into a dangerous and unhelpful simulate mode . If I ever figure out what that means , Ill tell you in a future post . I figured out the antenna problem the hard way in an ice storm outside of Ottawa . I 'm a fan of GUI design , and I must say that the UI here is very , very bad . Not the worse I have ever seen , but very bad : non - intuitive , inconsistent , and arbitrary . The FIND function / button has an entirely different function in the GPS section from the Palm section . Of course , the same icon is used . I can not imagine grandma using this thing to navigate . What little there is of the very pretty documentation is atrocious . About 10 times more information is needed here . It shuts down randomly on occasion for no apparent purpose ( Battery savings maybe ? ) . The secure digital card is too small ( max of 256 MB ) , so you ca n't put more than a few California counties in the memory . Maps storage is managed with a rather hostile GUI . This is not fatal , but is irritating . I would rather put a 1 GB SD card in the iQue 3600 and be done with it . The iQue 3600 burns too much power to be used as a portable , so it must always be tethered to the car or resting in the cradle . I do n't find the power issue to be a problem . I understand that to get clear , bright screens it is necessary to use power . I agree with the tradeoff here .",697,0,0.03148455902387758,0.00020408163265308208,0.00020408163265308208,0.04617685732553363,0.00020408163265308208,0.00020408163265308208,0.00020408163265308208,0.00020408163265308208,0.011445411307648833,0.00020408163265308208,0.00020408163265308208,0.00020408163265308208,0.05988849607960123,0.00020408163265308208,0.010408163265304355,0.00020408163265308208,0.15861295505497433,0.00020408163265308208,0.02061224489795938,0.04622580027922472,0.00020408163265308208,0.00020408163265308208,0.138347091400596,0.010800680013560982,0.01076519266580192,0.00020408163265308208,0.00020408163265308208,0.00020408163265308208,0.00020408163265308208,0.00020408163265308208,0.00020408163265308208,0.00020408163265308208,0.15063334550208862,0.00020408163265308208,0.00020408163265308208,0.00020408163265308208,0.00020408163265308208,0.00020408163265308208,0.04083388137326604,0.00020408163265308208,0.00020408163265308208,0.04384215738583741,0.011549401754250297,0.00020408163265308208,0.05492392053547431,0.041002943675175284,0.10591628621492656,0.00020408163265308208,0.00020408163265308208,0.00020408163265308208,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0

52243,2,"Five Stars for the Buds , Zero Stars for the Cord I do not recommend Sennheiser 's MX75 headphones . First , the good features:1 . As with all Sennheiser products , these earphones deliver first rate sound for its price range.2 . The earphones are very comfortable and easy to fit properly using the included pads.3 . Once inserted in the ear , these earphones will not fall out due to vibration , movement or sweating . However , the cord has ugly problems:1 . The cord is unusually stiff and consequently tends to be tough to manage . This is especially true when the phones are first removed from the package , as the cord maintains a sort of corkscrew shape for quite some time.2 . The cord running to the right earphone is substantially longer than the one connecting to the left earphone . The result is annoying slack around the face and neck.3 . The cord is the ugliest possible shade of green . All in all , should Sennheiser offer a new product using the same earphones , but with conventional wiring , I 'll be a buyer .

52269,2,"Cheap junk Cheap piece of junk . Probably has 2 cents of electronic parts in it . I 'm returning it to Wallmart . It might work OK if you live like right next door to the broadcast transmitter . Otherwise it 's just too weak in its signal pulling ability . Also , when I turn the gain dials , they do n't seem like they are really variable . I think they are really just on / off switches disguised as variable dials , because i do n't see any difference between medium gain and high gain on any of the channels . I 'm going to now go to a REAL , serious electronics store and look for some SERIOUS tv electronics hardware instead of Wallmart garbage . I 'm going to work on improving my roof antenna and its cabling and I 'm going to try using a variable gain preamp if I can find one ( a high quality one , not junk ) . I tried a preamp from Wallmart ( which was n't adjustable at all ) and it did help a lot with UHF channels , but the VHF channels were much worse because it made the signal too strong . So I need a variable gain preamp , assuming there is such a thing . I would advise everyone to go read the information available on the internet about tv antennas and how to get the best picture with them . I did yesterday and there 's a lot of good stuff I never knew before .",266,0,0.09390074430338843,0.00040000000000003526,0.04161809945986449,0.00040000000000003526,0.00040000000000003526,0.00040000000000003526,0.00040000000000003526,0.00040000000000003526,0.00040000000000003526,0.00040000000000003526,0.00040000000000003526,0.00040000000000003526,0.2053491305368133,0.00040000000000003526,0.017052225575817412,0.00040000000000003526,0.00040000000000003526,0.0431364709964497,0.00040000000000003526,0.00040000000000003526,0.00040000000000003526,0.00040000000000003526,0.00040000000000003526,0.03689597744187311,0.00040000000000003526,0.00040000000000003526,0.00040000000000003526,0.00040000000000003526,0.00040000000000003526,0.02817375144473446,0.00040000000000003526,0.00040000000000003526,0.17028871110686436,0.00040000000000003526,0.00040000000000003526,0.00040000000000003526,0.00040000000000003526,0.00040000000000003526,0.0729004053612136,0.00040000000000003526,0.00040000000000003526,0.00040000000000003526,0.00040000000000003526,0.00040000000000003526,0.17518560039553013,0.09989888337744957,0.00040000000000003526,0.00040000000000003526,0.00040000000000003526,0.00040000000000003526,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0
52276,2,"Terrible , useless , and unecessarily complicated . All I wanted was something to make the incoming audio louder while listening to a call and typing during an interview . I could n't find just a headset amp so I purchased this "" system "" based on Plantronics ' good name . Instead of just plugging it into the wall phone jack , you have to use a regular phone , route the receiver / handset cord to this , then back out to the receiver / handset again , which makes this light unit basically hamstrung between the headset and handset and does n't want to sit on the desk without taping it down . Then you have to take the receiver / handset off the hook , place it on the desk ( assuming you have desk space , which I do n't ) then push a button to start up the headset . Most importantly , listening sound quality was muffled and not very loud . If I turned up the incoming sound volume , it immediately put a loud annoying squeal of feedback into the microphone , making it totally unusable . I went back to my regular , unampflied Plantronics headset which just plugs into the wall phone and is always on with no extra cords , ac adapter , or buttons to push . I 'm not very thrilled with that , but for $ 15 it sounds MUCH better and much louder , without the feedback or the hassles . So for now I guess I 'll stick with that until I find something else that just improves the incoming sound",278,0,0.000555555555555603,0.000555555555555603,0.03962121445281067,0.000555555555555603,0.030624152186356616,0.000555555555555603,0.000555555555555603,0.000555555555555603,0.030788543982729705,0.000555555555555603,0.08615656020524667,0.000555555555555603,0.13315171688256502,0.000555555555555603,0.000555555555555603,0.000555555555555603,0.000555555555555603,0.000555555555555603,0.000555555555555603,0.000555555555555603,0.000555555555555603,0.000555555555555603,0.03543977467603647,0.000555555555555603,0.000555555555555603,0.000555555555555603,0.13892279923015205,0.000555555555555603,0.10988146610763015,0.000555555555555603,0.000555555555555603,0.000555555555555603,0.000555555555555603,0.000555555555555603,0.000555555555555603,0.000555555555555603,0.000555555555555603,0.000555555555555603,0.000555555555555603,0.16516612571697473,0.000555555555555603,0.000555555555555603,0.000555555555555603,0.000555555555555603,0.2080254243372737,0.000555555555555603,0.000555555555555603,0.000555555555555603,0.000555555555555603,0.000555555555555603,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

52286,2,"Not ready for primetime ... I 'm a longtime user of Wacom Intuos tablets and I was looking for something similar with wireless capabilities for my new dual 2.5ghz - G5 . There were no wireless Intuos products available at the time of purchase , so I went with the Graphire Bluetooth . Unfortunately , the product leaves a lot to be desired and after a couple of weeks of use , I plan on returning it . The major problem lies with the pen -- both in design and responsiveness . Design : the Graphire series is cheaper than the Intuos , and there 's a good reason why : the Graphire pen is thinner , lighter , and has no grip . If you have very small hands this might be acceptable ; in my hand this feels like a toothpick . It 's very difficult to manipulate a tool effectively when it does n't feel like it has any durability . Additionally , the Graphire pen stand is little more than a piece of transparent molded plastic and slides around the desk whenever I put the pen back into it . Responsiveness : There is a half - second delay whenever using the pen to click in any finder - related options -- opening windows , selecting files , etc . 1/2 second may sound acceptable , but if you , like me , use the pen for everything , not just drawing , believe me it is utterly maddening . On the other hand , the mouse behaves perfectly with no delay at all , so I know it 's the pen and not my computer . The tablet is attractive and the mouse works fine , but the bottom line is that it 's more important for me to have a responsive , durable pen than a wireless tablet . If you 've never used an Intuos you may not recognize the deficiencies , but for those who have , this is like going from a Mercedes to a Honda Civic . You 'll get better gas mileage with the Civic but the Benz gives you the best overall driving experience . I need the driving experience , so I 'm going back to the Intuos -- wire and all .",386,0,0.00032258064516132713,0.14645128076808217,0.0331208119454456,0.00032258064516132713,0.00032258064516132713,0.00032258064516132713,0.017322767695410433,0.00032258064516132713,0.03859807013285129,0.00032258064516132713,0.01872637764637171,0.00032258064516132713,0.09144033102133432,0.00032258064516132713,0.03215891280084491,0.00032258064516132713,0.12431402354270948,0.00032258064516132713,0.00032258064516132713,0.00032258064516132713,0.00032258064516132713,0.00032258064516132713,0.13981811245373518,0.022069654556982524,0.00032258064516132713,0.00032258064516132713,0.00032258064516132713,0.00032258064516132713,0.019908314275544882,0.00032258064516132713,0.00032258064516132713,0.00032258064516132713,0.00032258064516132713,0.00032258064516132713,0.00032258064516132713,0.00032258064516132713,0.00032258064516132713,0.00032258064516132713,0.02821996544866265,0.028318832639797717,0.06798463635649384,0.00032258064516132713,0.00032258064516132713,0.00032258064516132713,0.1240544671940261,0.00032258064516132713,0.05652569958622205,0.00032258064516132713,0.00032258064516132713,0.00032258064516132713,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0

52334,2,"So so product with tons of potential . But breaks . Bought these pretty cheap , from woot.com . The good:- Great sound quality , all digital transmission so no hissing.- Look good- Decent battery lifeThe bad:- needs drivers ( most USB headsets - granted , not wireless - don't)- Does n't work on the Mac- If you are not playing music , they beep every 15 seconds or so . Then after a couple of minutes they turn themselves off . This drove me crazy and was not configurable.- Takes you ~15 seconds every time you turn them on and try to pair them.- Not terribly comfortable . After about a month of normal use , the headset cracked in the middle and stopped working . Bad quality o material . The Logitech people said they will refund whatever I paid for after I send them a copy of the receipt and the broken product . Too bad I get to pay for shipping and I 'm not even sure they 'll refund the ORIGINAL shipping .

52371,2,"Beware if there are few unused frequencies in your area I purchased the Kensington after my casette adapter developed an annoying wheel noise . I heard and read a lot about the problems with FM transmitters , like static and audio quality but the Kensington was the best rated unit . It arrived the day before I had to take a business trip and thought it would be a great test . The first day I used it , it seemed to work great . The next day on my return trip home , all I got was static and could barely hear the music from my iPod . I tried every station I could find with little or no transmission on it , but the audio quality remained extremely poor . I am not sure if there are just too many stations broadcasting in the NYC metro area or this particular unit is defective , but since my car has a casette player I will go with casette adapter for now . If you have lots of unused frequencies , it might work in your area .

52381,2,"Great hardware and interface spoiled by poor map data I really wanted to like the TomTom Navigator 5 . The GPS itself is tiny , well - designed , and very sensitive . It worked fine from down in a underdash cupholder or in the glove compartment . The interface is attractive and easy to navigate . The voice prompts are clear and loud . The installation on a Mac was problematic . Search on TomTom OSX for details , but suffice it to say that the installer included on the CDs simply does n't work and a new one must be downloaded . Once past that , it ran fine on my Treo 700p . Unfortunately there is one fatal flaw - the map database . In using the Navigator in both California and North Carolina , the maps regularly had misnamed streets , exits referred to by numbers where there were none , and directions that lacked critical information like heading ( i.e. take the 101 instead of take 101N when approaching a complex interchange ) . Worse , the company seems to be actively hostile to updating these maps . If you go to the TomTom site , you can purchase maps on a city - by - city basis . Are they newer than the ones that came with your unit ? Who knows ? TomTom lists no version info and seems to expect you to buy and cross your fingers . There were just too many errors that I saw while traveling in areas that I 'm familiar with to trust the TomTom maps for any unfamiliar territory . Everything else is great , but the whole point of a GPS is accurate navigation . And sadly , that 's where the TomTom Navigator fails",300,0,0.0005555555555556117,0.0005555555555556117,0.028823661613011926,0.0005555555555556117,0.060325736956250986,0.0005555555555556117,0.0005555555555556117,0.0005555555555556117,0.06351235518199462,0.0005555555555556117,0.0005555555555556117,0.0005555555555556117,0.0005555555555556117,0.0005555555555556117,0.0005555555555556117,0.0005555555555556117,0.0005555555555556117,0.10481718745108258,0.0005555555555556117,0.0005555555555556117,0.0005555555555556117,0.0005555555555556117,0.05186649840825625,0.0005555555555556117,0.0005555555555556117,0.0005555555555556117,0.0005555555555556117,0.0005555555555556117,0.0005555555555556117,0.0005555555555556117,0.0005555555555556117,0.0005555555555556117,0.18376806141813795,0.0005555555555556117,0.0005555555555556117,0.0005555555555556117,0.0005555555555556117,0.0005555555555556117,0.2638627364630893,0.0005555555555556117,0.058021009578007786,0.0005555555555556117,0.0005555555555556117,0.0005555555555556117,0.0005555555555556117,0.12304586228330505,0.039734668424638867,0.0005555555555556117,0.0005555555555556117,0.0005555555555556117,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0

Chord is robust and long . Easily fits over my long desk to my CPU that rests beneath.3 . Controls are easy to use , although the mic on / off switch does n't click into place like I 'd expect it to . It just slides back and forth . I can see people accidentally turning it off.4 . Headphones produce good sound , although nothing extraordinary.5 . The mic itself freely rotates , so you can position it however you desire . Cons:1 . First and foremost , if you 've got a small head DO NOT PURCHASE THIS ! ! My head is not big and these headphones ARE NOT ADJUSTABLE ! These headphones are so large that they 're actually uncomfortable . Their entire weight rests on my ears and I ca n't wear them for very long without my ears falling off.2 . These headphones are very heavy , uncomfortably so . I 've resorted to holding them up to my head and listening through one speaker to take the weight off my ears.3 . Perhaps having the airspace between the speakers and the frame keeps your ears cooler , but it still feels like I 'm wearing a set of insulated ear muffs . Chatting on hot summer days is limited to 10 minutes or less until I 'm dying of heat exhaustion.4 . You need to get a Y splitter if you wish to have these headphones and your computer speakers on at the same time . If you do n't have front headphone plugs on your case this is an issue . Otherwise you have to crawl under your desk and manually disconnect the headset from your motherboard jacks and plug in your speakers again . Y splitters are only a few dollars but it 's an accessory you will have to purchase , especially since front speaker ports on most computers ca n't be hooked up at the same time as your rear motherboard jack ( and most people have their main sound systems plugged in with the rear one ) . Granted , this is more of a general microphone / headset combo issue than anything Logitek related , but if this is your first microphone / headset purchase then you should be aware of this problem . I use onboard audio instead of a sound card , so I do n't have multiple output jacks.5 . These headphones are designed to rest behind your neck , not over the top of your head . Unfortunately , the plastic beam is too heavy and pulls the speakers back , placing all the weight on your ears . The plastic beam is also too short ( and just ! ) to go over the top of my head for a more comfortable fit . 6 . The design also does n't make sense . The beam is so short that it should rest behind your neck , yet the angle of the speakers through that air gap is better for wearing the beam over your head . It 's pretty uncomfortable . If the headset was adjustable it would be fine ! The earpieces are just too huge!Overall I 'm disappointed with these . If you 're under 5'10 "" I say go with another model . The hardware works great , but the design is terrible . I 'm returning these and purchasing an uglier , but more functional , set of smaller headphones",649,0,0.14127471387917892,0.12831221966814854,0.02275103990679923,0.04935157654725302,0.008246532163557127,0.00017857142857144538,0.009107142873172089,0.00017857142857144538,0.020791381803802984,0.00017857142857144538,0.08791932610703324,0.00017857142857144538,0.06330585549396922,0.00017857142857144538,0.00017857142857144538,0.00017857142857144538,0.00017857142857144538,0.00017857142857144538,0.00910714285714274,0.00017857142857144538,0.00017857142857144538,0.00017857142857144538,0.032865911458560465,0.00017857142857144538,0.00017857142857144538,0.03956231880776144,0.00017857142857144538,0.00017857142857144538,0.18009469926768615,0.029086569066329542,0.00017857142857144538,0.00017857142857144538,0.00017857142857144538,0.00017857142857144538,0.00017857142857144538,0.00017857142857144538,0.00017857142857144538,0.00017857142857144538,0.01442728700614562,0.0955793029580155,0.00017857142857144538,0.00017857142857144538,0.016488735101336797,0.00017857142857144538,0.00017857142857144538,0.023339823391369863,0.022852707357022894,0.00017857142857144538,0.00017857142857144538,0.00017857142857144538,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0

52412,2,"Keyboard Layout Sucks ; Mouse Only 2 Buttons + Wheel The keyboard with this set is flimsy and cheap feeling . Worse , the layout is nonstandard : they 've messed up the key cluster above the arrows ( Insert / Delete / Home / End / etc . ) . And the right hand Ctrl is not below the right end of the Shift key , it is under the left end of the Shift key , where one of the Windows keys ( the context menu one ) normally is . They 've taken out one of the Windows menu keys , too . The wireless features worked fine ( I 've used it two days ) and worked even without installing their driver software ( something I 'm always reluctant to do ) . I think some of the extra buttons ( multimedia controls ) on the keyboard do n't work for me , because of this . I use the computer it 's on for work , not screwing around , so this does n't bother me . ( I have it installed on a Thinkpad laptop so I can keep the screen farther from my eyes , and my employer bought the thing ; it would n't have been my first choice.)I've given it two stars only because it worked great , out of the box , with no driver software .

I could n't . I tried several different drivers ( some users recommended a driver from Realtek ) and none worked . It 's my guess ( and totally a guess ) that this card is really only for older Macs that are limited to 10.2 . D - Link does n't seem to have any intention of supporting modern Macs .

52558,2,"At this price point i think the many other mice feel more solid than this logitech mouse . I mainly chose this mouse because I needed one quickly and it was black and matched my set up . I had been using the standard greyish white optical mouse with a scroll wheel and a red light that shined out from under my wrist . This one feels smaller , but still comfortable . However a couple weeks of normal usage made the mouse much less solid feeling . The plastic now mushes as the seems flex slightly in my hand . I decided to have a friend repair the cable of my old mouse . :-/ I am going to donate this mouse to a friend who still has a tracking ball mouse . I like some of Logitechs products and higher end mice . But I would stay away from this mouse . Its not bad , its just not good enough to pick over other mice that cost the same amount . Hope that helps .

And it looked awesome .... for about 2 weeks . Then the short in the cables caused only the blue and green colors to work making everything look creepy . It would just fade back and forth until it just stop and the TV would have all the colors washed out in green . I found that I could stick a PS2 case under the cables at the base and it went away .

52623,2,"Good in theory ... major issues in practice I 've been using my BEFW11S4 for a few months now . The little thing has its good points - a nice , unobtrusive little box I can just plug in and hide on top of some piece of office furniture , allowing my rather over - laptop - equipped household some nice convenient net access , while still allowing the home office systems a wired connection . Sounds nice , if it only worked . Howver , BEFW11S4 has a MAJOR problem , and a rather common one at that . Specifically , it locks up . It does so frequently . I have to unplug the router at least once a day , and frequently twice , to deal with it locking up . Ca n't even access the administrator screen , and even hitting the reset button is n't enough to fix it . Wireless is n't too useful when you have to physically walk to the unit multiple times a day , is it?The problem seems to lie not in the hardware , but in the firmware ( the software that runs on the router ) . If Linksys would release reliable firmware for this router , I 'd give it 4 - 5 stars . But until they resolve the issue that wires down their wireless modem , I ca n't possibly justify giving the BEFW11S4 more then two stars",243,0,0.0005882352941176732,0.13985841881248953,0.13086722443456875,0.0005882352941176732,0.03642976662121209,0.0005882352941176732,0.0005882352941176732,0.0005882352941176732,0.0005882352941176732,0.0005882352941176732,0.0005882352941176732,0.0005882352941176732,0.23348736213517596,0.0005882352941176732,0.02709009797405909,0.0005882352941176732,0.0005882352941176732,0.0005882352941176732,0.0005882352941176732,0.0005882352941176732,0.0005882352941176732,0.0005882352941176732,0.24137988441435723,0.0005882352941176732,0.0005882352941176732,0.0005882352941176732,0.13618136325519647,0.0005882352941176732,0.0005882352941176732,0.0005882352941176732,0.0005882352941176732,0.0005882352941176732,0.0005882352941176732,0.0005882352941176732,0.0005882352941176732,0.0005882352941176732,0.0005882352941176732,0.0005882352941176732,0.0005882352941176732,0.0005882352941176732,0.0005882352941176732,0.0005882352941176732,0.029999999999998722,0.0005882352941176732,0.0005882352941176732,0.0005882352941176732,0.0005882352941176732,0.0005882352941176732,0.0005882352941176732,0.0005882352941176732,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
52626,2,"Unbelievable Piece of Junk without real Support This is the best sounding PC speaker system available . Absolutley stellar sound quality -- for how long is a serious problem . I too own 2 of these systems . After eleven months of bliss my first amp also went out . I call Klipsch technical support , and they explain I can send it in but the amp is backordered for 4 - 6 weeks . So I buy another one from Amazon and thier retailer Beach Audio , Inc. , not having 4 - 6 weeks to wait for bliss to return . So get this please , not $ 360 plus tax once , but twice , and add 2 occurances of overnight shipping at $ 125 per , for a total spend of $ 970 plus tax!!!Well blow me down but the replacement for amp # 1 hasen't even showed up , and 6 working days of bliss later ? You guessed it amp # 2 fails . Klipsch , well they obviously picked quite a piece of crap for an amp . They stand behind the product though -- I have another RMA to send to the fine people at the Klipsch return center . The retailer this site uses , Beach Audio Inc. , offered me my money back , but would offer no replacement of any sort , and no refund for the $ 125 shipping charge . Nothing they wanted to do would help me get a working product . They refered me to Klipsch without mercy , or even lube . Now Klipsch makes some fine home audio ( my Klipschhorns are 15 years old , have been rocked to death , and still sound awesome ) , and this ProMedia Ultra unit sounds fabulous -- so I may do business with them again ( perhaps not the PC Multimedia division ) , but I vow to never give another red cent to Amazon 's retailer Beach Audio , Inc .. They were uncooperative , unsympathetic , curt , short , unprofessional , and ultimately completely useless when contacted about the failure . PLEASE LOOK ELSWHERE FOR YOUR NEXT PC MULTIMEDIA PURCHASE ! ! ! ! ! ! !

Then nothing happens i.e. no wireless printing .

Changing the IP address messes up my internet connection during install ; the MAC works quite hard to re - establish the internet connection and perhaps this breaks the connection to the printer ? I dunno , but it 's giving me a headache .

52730,2,"adequate for simple recording only I purchased this in the hope that I would be able to record verbal messages to myself , creative thoughts and ideas , etc . It does an adequate job of that . I had also hoped I could use it as a simple player , to download affirmations and such to listen to throughout the day . This it wo n't do , and it was not clear to me from the information here and on the Olympus site that it would not function this way . First , even though it records wav files , it does not let you handle them well at all . To transfer recordings to your computer , you have to install special software ( included ) , but you can not transfer wav files back to the recorder ( according to the software guide ) . If you want a recorder / player to function easily like that , you should go for the more expensive ones that allow you to use them as a USB flash drive ( like the Creative Zen series ) . I did not install the software , as it offered nothing other than the simple transfer of a recording to my computer . I can record directly to the PC with much higher quality , so why bother ? Noise recorded in a high quality format is still noise . It makes more sense to simply repeat anything I record on the Olympus and record it directly to the PC.Second , the sound quality is not great . Given that wav files are what are used on CDs , one would expect more than what this device delivers . It is noisy on either of the mic settings , and I would have to describe the sound quality as medium . Do n't expect high fidelity . This is a voice recorder for recording quick notes and not much else . Even analog tape would be better for most things . I may be fussier than most about this , having some professional background in audio , so the sound quality may be okay for most people . People have gotten used to lower standards in just about everything . Finally , playback was very disappointing to me . It has only the simplest playback features . It plays , pauses , fast forwards , and reverses , period . You can not repeat either a single recording or portion of one , and you can not create any kind of list to specify only certain files to play . It plays ( manually ) one recording at a time and that is it . You can not set markers to fast forward or reverse to ( like chapters on a DVD ) , and searching through a recording of any length is a major pain . In fact , this recorder is defined more by what it can not do than what it can do . It is well built physically , although it is definitely designed for small hands , and can be a bit uncomfortable to use if your hands are n't small . If all you want is to record medium quality voice , this will work fine . Do n't expect it to record music or anything like that - you will be disappointed . Think of it as the audio version of a $ 20 digital camera . Cheap , quick , grabs the image , but no frills at all . Do n't expect much and you wo n't be disappointed . I am usually very happy with Olympus gear , but this is definitely below their usual standard . Unless your needs are very spartan and smple , I would recommend looking at more capable devices",643,0,0.11072041517401175,0.0001869158878504866,0.0887732808475476,0.0001869158878504866,0.0001869158878504866,0.0001869158878504866,0.05540480931208822,0.0001869158878504866,0.07199495665672707,0.0001869158878504866,0.0001869158878504866,0.0001869158878504866,0.1022382241993232,0.0001869158878504866,0.0001869158878504866,0.0001869158878504866,0.03493029921851174,0.018088936418948803,0.009532710280372966,0.0001869158878504866,0.0001869158878504866,0.0001869158878504866,0.08003719504767198,0.010880267134795356,0.03155134817335445,0.010840022993749315,0.0001869158878504866,0.0001869158878504866,0.041048136316218634,0.0001869158878504866,0.0001869158878504866,0.0001869158878504866,0.05337098562979954,0.0001869158878504866,0.0001869158878504866,0.0001869158878504866,0.0001869158878504866,0.0001869158878504866,0.03658299929593842,0.04907643911090981,0.0001869158878504866,0.009723490063593753,0.02125187941701658,0.0001869158878504866,0.0813887466705383,0.03858762084852548,0.03855667644269316,0.0001869158878504866,0.0001869158878504866,0.0001869158878504866,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0

So , if you 're scanning a 10-page doc and it misses one somewhere along the way , have you really accomplished anything ? No . You must either try the whole thing again ( with likely the same result ) , or you must figure out what page(s ) is missing , scan it separately , and go thru a simple yet not expedient Acrobat process to insert the omitted page .

I did n't buy these on clearance at Target so that hurts my pocketbooks and I am very ANNOYED right now . In the meantime , I 've returned to some $ 10 non - earbud headphones and I really miss the noise - cancelling quality of these Philips earbuds . Life sucks and I want to die because now I can hear everything going on around me during the morning commute on public transportation .",189,0,0.0007142857142857577,0.11950641034471399,0.036135576063847985,0.03973794458182311,0.0007142857142857577,0.0007142857142857577,0.0007142857142857577,0.053818852610172295,0.0007142857142857577,0.0007142857142857577,0.0007142857142857577,0.0007142857142857577,0.0007142857142857577,0.0007142857142857577,0.0007142857142857577,0.0007142857142857577,0.0007142857142857577,0.20207117026289262,0.0007142857142857577,0.0007142857142857577,0.0007142857142857577,0.07233244841732518,0.0007142857142857577,0.0007142857142857577,0.0007142857142857577,0.0007142857142857577,0.0007142857142857577,0.0007142857142857577,0.07346564214706877,0.0007142857142857577,0.0007142857142857577,0.0007142857142857577,0.0007142857142857577,0.0007142857142857577,0.0007142857142857577,0.0007142857142857577,0.0007142857142857577,0.0007142857142857577,0.0007142857142857577,0.15809356214684867,0.0007142857142857577,0.0007142857142857577,0.0007142857142857577,0.0007142857142857577,0.21555267913959153,0.0007142857142857577,0.0007142857142857577,0.0007142857142857577,0.0007142857142857577,0.0007142857142857577,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

52793,2,"Do Your Research I bought this drive with the advice from my father who has bought several LaCie 's for his company . He 's always had good luck with them . The first thing that I noticed when I opened the box was that there was a gap between the case and the faceplate . I called LaCie customer service and they sent me instructions on how to open the case and also noted my serial number so that I would n't void my warranty . The problem was that there were 2 screws that hold the faceplate onto the internal chassis who were not even tighted ( as if they started the screws and did n't tighten them).By the way ... the actual HD inside the case is a Maxtor . If I had know that prior to purchase , I would not have bought the LaCie . I fixed the problem with the case and turned it on .. only to be hit with a high pitched winning sound coming from the HD . This noise will drive me crazy and is not "" Ultra Quiet "" as noted in the description .

52826,2,"HORRIBLE SOFTWARE ! I had several problems with the iPod , mostly because of its horrible software iTunes . It messed up the firmware on the device several times , it would complain constantly that it is not up to date and then try to update it which resuted in several crashes . The most horrible thing however was that it would mess up your MP3 music collection in a way that can never be undone . I had orgaized my collection in the file system nicely by genre , author , album etc , and this thing messed up everything . I have another mp3 player - iRiver - which I reccommend as a lot better than the iPod anyway - and I wanted to be able to copy things on it from my library .

With the first one the battery died 13 months after purchase . Since it was 30 days outside the warrantly , apple support told me "" sorry , tough luck . "" I made the mistake of buying another one figuring I just got a bad one and there was no way I could have the same problem again .

After that I ran scandisk on all of them and only 1 disk did nt have bad sectors . A few of the disks had bad sectors in the system area rendering them unformattable .

First I tried downloading the driver . Turns out the driver is a .zip file so I had to download WinZip so I could unzip the driver . After downloading the driver and WinZip the flash drive is still not recognized by my PC . The FAQ at the manufacturer 's web site states if the device is not recognized the BIOS on my PC must be enabled .

52883,2,"Midland GTX600VP4 Radios Bogus - Midland Bogus Using this product to communicate between motorcycles as promoted by the very fact that there are motorcycle headsets for your helmut available for these radios is clearly unsafe . The distractions created by the radios having no range after about 100 feet can prove fatal for a motorcycle ryder due to a momentary lapse in concentration , just as it would be between a bike and a car . I purchased these radios as the better of the Midland lot - with an 18 mile range . An outright lie . I bought them to communicate between two motorcycles- either myself and my brother ( after also purchasing 2 of the motorcycle helmut headstets ) , or between me on the bike and my girlfriend driving my jeep following me on a long distance ride . We do n't even get 100 feet out of them when the radios begin to breakup and are usless . The range increases as long as you are not moving . I have n't tested them while one user is moving on the road or on the highway and one user sitting stationary . I intend to contact Midland about a full refund , but if they do n't work when you are moving then what good are they ? . How could they fabricate these claims of 18 miles ? Even if they could n't do 18 miles , how about a half mile ? How about 1/4 mile or 1/8 mile ? Not even that . This is a discrace . I 'm just another customer handed a bogus deal .

52979,2,"Extremely poor software package that makes it very disappointing I had a very poor experience with the Microsoft Media Center infrared keyboard and I wanted to replace it with a bluetooth solution that would - I thought - get rid of all connection problems . I was wrong . The hardware is very nice but the software keeps on dropping connections . AS usual , I was very careful : I always read manuals and properly install the software before using any product - I do n't want to fail the installation for a very simple reason : the package does n't come cheap ... I am a software developer - I have half a dozen computers at home - and I did everything as instructed . I found the software to be very average in terms of usability ( why do they try to do all these fancy effects ? ? ) , but that 's not very important when it works fine . Unfortunately , after just a couple of days , the keyboard stopped working . I finally managed to get it back by removing the batteries and rebooting the computer ( both step were required - the on / off switch did n't work - same thing for the connect button which is totally ineffective ) . Now , the mouse keeps on dropping connections . After a couple of hours of inactivity , the mouse simply stops responding . This is simply unacceptable . Logitech knows that this product does n't work and keeps on charging customers for something that is simply not usable because it was n't tested properly . It is a very frustrating experience because the hardware is great . Do n't buy this product , you could be very disappointed . Note that I have seen another installation done by professional Windows system administrators that had the exact same problems . Now do n't get me wrong : the hardware is very nice . I would highly recommend the Logitech VX Revolution Cordless Laser Mouse for Notebooks which is great and had none of the issues I have mentioned there",359,0,0.0002941176470588454,0.0586317964353439,0.050504240742043745,0.061875163406986206,0.029748611943698496,0.0002941176470588454,0.029739519800389906,0.0002941176470588454,0.0002941176470588454,0.0002941176470588454,0.09104147504651611,0.02382434683302575,0.0002941176470588454,0.0002941176470588454,0.014999999670021635,0.0002941176470588454,0.0002941176470588454,0.01952111836770722,0.0002941176470588454,0.0002941176470588454,0.0002941176470588454,0.0002941176470588454,0.2091279090723154,0.0002941176470588454,0.0002941176470588454,0.0002941176470588454,0.0002941176470588454,0.0002941176470588454,0.0002941176470588454,0.0002941176470588454,0.0002941176470588454,0.0002941176470588454,0.03106520503030174,0.0002941176470588454,0.0002941176470588454,0.0002941176470588454,0.0002941176470588454,0.0002941176470588454,0.09519010538687171,0.0002941176470588454,0.0002941176470588454,0.0002941176470588454,0.0002941176470588454,0.0002941176470588454,0.1857145056215688,0.08842776734909129,0.0002941176470588454,0.0002941176470588454,0.0002941176470588454,0.0002941176470588454,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0

53047,2,"Almost a must , if you use the battery grip I would n't be without this . When I first bought the 20d it was my first digital SLR and I spent a few weeks adding and removing the battery grip and this strap . In the end I settled for using both and would n't have it any other way . With the battery grip and hand strap in place I find the camera much more secure and comfortable to hold . That 's all there is to it , that 's what it does and it does it well . On the down side , and it 's a small and transient down side , actually fitting it to the camera and getting it adjusted to the exact right length for your hand is a bit fiddly and you 'd sort of expect it to be insecure . I think the trick , security wise , is to make sure the bottom strap goes through the center buckle first , then it is locked in by the top strap which is already held securely at the junction with the neck strap ( if used ) . I also do n't like the attachment to the neck strap , I do n't like having a fairly sharp edged piece of metal where it can rub against the chasis of the camera in normal use . I use this on a 20d which typically has a 24 - 200 or 80 - 400 lens attached . You can only use this if you also use the battery grip , or buy a third party plate which attaches to the tripod mount and provides the lower mounting location . But since I always use the battery grip I do n't have an issue . If Canon read this , you could do with a better solution for the attachment and adjustment on an accessory of this price , you normally pay close attention to detail and it 's a bit lacking here",341,1,0.26101929868005697,0.12768697681215652,0.0004166666666666916,0.0004166666666666916,0.0004166666666666916,0.0004166666666666916,0.0004166666666666916,0.0004166666666666916,0.0004166666666666916,0.0004166666666666916,0.0004166666666666916,0.0004166666666666916,0.0004166666666666916,0.0004166666666666916,0.020154139578968572,0.0004166666666666916,0.08543881059157475,0.09616606119231005,0.0004166666666666916,0.0004166666666666916,0.0004166666666666916,0.0004166666666666916,0.19520958762648635,0.0004166666666666916,0.0004166666666666916,0.0004166666666666916,0.0004166666666666916,0.0004166666666666916,0.0004166666666666916,0.0004166666666666916,0.0004166666666666916,0.0004166666666666916,0.0004166666666666916,0.0004166666666666916,0.0004166666666666916,0.0004166666666666916,0.025456545829579087,0.0004166666666666916,0.0004166666666666916,0.0004166666666666916,0.0004166666666666916,0.0004166666666666916,0.0004166666666666916,0.0004166666666666916,0.0004166666666666916,0.0004166666666666916,0.17136857968886673,0.0004166666666666916,0.0004166666666666916,0.0004166666666666916,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

53072,2,"Good performance for $ 150 ; but cheaply made ( in China ) . I 've owned many Sony electronics in the past and have always liked their styling and functionality -- lots of hardy Walkmen , useful shortwave and portable radios , stylish TVs and high quality cassette recorders . I still have a Sony mini component stereo model FH - E656 ( made in Japan ) which I bought in 1992 for US$ 400 + ; but rather than pay to fix its worn - out CD player , I decided to purchase this new Sony MHCEC70 component stereo ( made in China).PLUSES : decent soundgood functionalityeasy set - up and intuitive operationsimple remote -- but only covers basic functionsCONS : very short speaker leadsunattractive styling ( for my tastes ) -- resembles a boomboxonly holds 3 CDs vs 5 for comparable Panasonic unitsAt first glance , I was disappointed by the cheap construction , skimpy manual and very short speaker leads -- the manufacturer seemed to be counting pennies . But then I thought : in 2006 for $ 150 , I ca n't expect the same quality as I received in 1992 for $ 400 . Everything is made more cheaply now and almost all in China . So , for the money , it suits my purposes as a nice sounding stereo unit for the bedroom . The real test will be how long the CD changer works -- to be safe , this time I bought the 2 year replacement warranty . I have n't blasted it at full volume , but it seems to have plenty of power when needed . I originally bought a $ 300 Panasonic unit ( SC - PM71SD MP3 SD Micro System ) which was returned because it did n't have the full data recording feature as advertised ( data recording was crippled by DRM limitations ) . This Sony stereo costs half as much , and has almost all the same functionality",335,1,0.0004761904761905158,0.07549605708638808,0.1264260623777921,0.19127107495963955,0.0004761904761905158,0.0004761904761905158,0.0004761904761905158,0.0004761904761905158,0.0004761904761905158,0.0004761904761905158,0.0004761904761905158,0.024285714285712825,0.0004761904761905158,0.0004761904761905158,0.02428571408581859,0.0004761904761905158,0.0004761904761905158,0.0004761904761905158,0.0004761904761905158,0.0004761904761905158,0.0004761904761905158,0.09963938208211674,0.10013554408833486,0.026238766321710256,0.0004761904761905158,0.08872374493794795,0.0004761904761905158,0.0004761904761905158,0.0004761904761905158,0.0004761904761905158,0.0004761904761905158,0.0004761904761905158,0.0004761904761905158,0.0004761904761905158,0.0004761904761905158,0.0004761904761905158,0.0004761904761905158,0.0004761904761905158,0.0004761904761905158,0.08007390310513504,0.0004761904761905158,0.024580504309531254,0.0004761904761905158,0.0004761904761905158,0.12074829426463324,0.0004761904761905158,0.0004761904761905158,0.0004761904761905158,0.0004761904761905158,0.0004761904761905158,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

53109,2,"Repairs discs to useable condition as described With boys aged 2 and 3 , and some poor disc storage procedures when I 'm driving , it appeared I was in need of one of these units . Generally my toddler boys are not permitted to handle discs , but it occassionally happens , and does n't take long for scratches , damage and finger prints to hinder performance , and when changing children 's cds in the car I do n't always store the disc properly and that leads to damage also . I read through a lot of reviews on this item and the skipdoctor products , and finally decided on this unit because it runs on a / c power , is fully contained and automatic , and was about $ 10 less expensive than the most equivalent skipdoctor unit . Both items had mixed reviews - mostly positive , but I found that most people who tried to make the units work and put in some time and effort were satisfied with both products . I 'm very satisfied with my purchase it has repaired two discs that could not be played at all , and one that skipped . This product repairs a disc to "" useable "" condition , it does not repair it so that scratches are not visible . I can still see , but not necessarily feel the scratches . It 's also important to remember that some scratches do not affect performance . If a disc plays well , but shows scratches - I just clean off the finger prints with a cloth or use the unit to clean the disc and see if the performance is satisfactory before attempting a full repair . I agree that the instructions with the unit could be better . I saved the instructions provided by another reviewer to use with the provided instructions for clarity . Also , some severely scratched and damaged discs do take many passes to repair , so I agree it is time consuming to acheive a full repair for some items - but it is possible . I noticed that I could cut down some of the repair time and solution usage by repeating the buffing / sanding ( pink disc ) process several times in a row for deeper scratches before using the repair . I ran one disc through 3 times in a row , then used the repair cream solution with yellow pads and it played fine . My lesser damaged disc only required one pass with the buffer and one with the repair until it worked great . I usually clean the disc ( manually with the cloth or with the machine depending on severity of grime ) , then buff , then repair . It can be time consuming to repair a disc to functioning , but it does save the disc and my discs play like new despite the scratches that are still visable . I think this was good purchase and not overly complicated to use .",515,1,0.00027027027027029884,0.03069635855337836,0.06931929656535127,0.02077829013438775,0.034951700563307035,0.00027027027027029884,0.00027027027027029884,0.00027027027027029884,0.03561613595359391,0.00027027027027029884,0.013870250079318133,0.00027027027027029884,0.19175758284377917,0.00027027027027029884,0.00027027027027029884,0.00027027027027029884,0.05625257488346039,0.00027027027027029884,0.013783783783783638,0.021436034352172957,0.00027027027027029884,0.00027027027027029884,0.14338227899526396,0.00027027027027029884,0.026878870044744176,0.00027027027027029884,0.00027027027027029884,0.00027027027027029884,0.00027027027027029884,0.00027027027027029884,0.00027027027027029884,0.00027027027027029884,0.036685181413030274,0.00027027027027029884,0.014735256647795786,0.00027027027027029884,0.00027027027027029884,0.00027027027027029884,0.029270731074595695,0.13154038818476274,0.018795911325340888,0.04740823550357541,0.00027027027027029884,0.00027027027027029884,0.00027027027027029884,0.00027027027027029884,0.05446276071997931,0.00027027027027029884,0.00027027027027029884,0.00027027027027029884,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

53132,2,"Budget solution . In no means good sound without tweaks . The Sony SS - MF650H are a low - cost solution to good directional sound for a very small room . Though I have not had the opportunity to test the ultra - high ( up to 50kHz ) frequency , the highs on these speakers sound very well , maybe only slightly boxy - note that the speakers are rather directional so the sound does not spread . The sound is very flat . The lack of depth makes it feel as if the sound is coming from a flat wall or a small box rather than from a space , especially if you stand further away ( over 5 ft . ) from the speakers . It seems that the speakers have a much lower than published sensitivity level . However , do n't get discouraged because with most speakers / headphones it may be that the speakers need some time to burn in ( loosen the diaphragm ) to get a bit more "" sustain "" to their output rather than seem to have a very sharp cutoff . The bass is very punchy , and not deep . I would definitely recommend a subwoofer for these speakers , as their highs are very good , and midranges are nice but maybe a bit flat . The subwoofer will party compensate for the problem , and you could even completely cut off the bottom frequency band and suffer little ill effect ( use the LFE on your receiver for the sub - woofer ... do n't worry , low frequency bass is not perceived by humans as directional so your surround or stereo wo n't suffer ) . In other words , you will need a lot of tweaking and additions to make these sound nicer than their out - of - the box quality . Ignore the 50kHz rating for ultra - high - frequency sound as a positive feature , as no receiver you will buy at the budget for these speakers will be rated for that output . Most are rated for 20 Hz - 20kHz , at a reasonable RMS.You get what you pay for ... for the price tag on them , the SSMF650H are good . They perform reasonably well on highs and mids ( but in no means studio reference sound ) , and are crisp and punchy on the bass . They do however seem to lack depth and have low sensitivity - especially so on the bass ... the further you move away from them ( and especially if you stand up above them ) , the sound quality suffers . I would recommend Wharfedale Diamond 8.4 speakers as a better choice if you 're willing to expand your budget a bit . Polk is also not a bad choice for cheap sound . I also demo - ed the ~$100 per pair CAT SDAT LEB-404 ( I think I saw them on overstock for $ 80 with free shipping ) . They are a bit shady , but excellent for the price - seems that the 20 Hz bass rating on them is actually somewhat accurate . If you 're looking for deep and bass - heavy sound without a sub - woofer , and are willing to take a hit on mids and highs a bit this is your "" budget solution "" instead of the SS - MF650H. I was pleasantly surprised . They also have poor sensitivity though , so if you have a big room shop around for something better .",609,1,0.10050009600429616,0.16739436549891673,0.06339905562626336,0.00019801980198021936,0.022173399838376493,0.00019801980198021936,0.00019801980198021936,0.00019801980198021936,0.00019801980198021936,0.00019801980198021936,0.13745995270408873,0.00019801980198021936,0.041381657402931676,0.00019801980198021936,0.00019801980198021936,0.00019801980198021936,0.00019801980198021936,0.0426927274187028,0.02000000000000077,0.00019801980198021936,0.00019801980198021936,0.00019801980198021936,0.00019801980198021936,0.00019801980198021936,0.029623871513459313,0.00019801980198021936,0.018305829018475286,0.00019801980198021936,0.16520348526701933,0.01146109251667101,0.00019801980198021936,0.00019801980198021936,0.11158469986948023,0.00019801980198021936,0.00019801980198021936,0.00019801980198021936,0.00019801980198021936,0.00019801980198021936,0.01253368473893442,0.00019801980198021936,0.04935538951307617,0.00019801980198021936,0.00019801980198021936,0.00019801980198021936,0.00019801980198021936,0.00019801980198021936,0.00019801980198021936,0.00019801980198021936,0.00019801980198021936,0.00019801980198021936,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

53149,2,"Danny I think this is as good as the expensive over $ 60 HDMI cables . I would n't spend money on the expensive ones . First of all , I 'm not a cable junkie nor an expert . However , according to my research , there 's no difference in performance b / w the expensive version nor the $ 12 , $ 15 , $ 20 version when it comes to HDMI since it 's all digital .. hole buch of zeros and ones . The durability of the cables ... I do n't know . But unless you 're someone who constantly plugs and unplugs the cables for some reason , it would n't matter . Normally , you 'd connect the cable and keep it that way for a long period of time , so the durability is not really relevant . Bottomline : This is as good as the expensive ones . I first tried out the expensive Monster brand which was $ 85 . Then I returned it after purchasing this , for the quality was the same .

53211,2,"Excellent sound for those willing to take a risk Echoing most other reviews here , this is an excellent set of earphones that are well worth the money . But buying them is a risk ! If you do n't wear these earphones correctly , they sound terrible , easily shown up by any pair of throwaway phones . Those unsatisfied with the sound quality ( especially those complaining of lack of bass ) either have n't put them in correctly or have oddly shaped ears . Learning how to put them in properly takes time . Be prepared to spend a few hours fiddling with them and trying the different included cushions . Once you teach yourself how to put them in , it will only take a few seconds . Some tips : Before inserting the earbuds , draw the phones up from behind your ear , holding the earbuds in the correct orientation ( drivers pointing medially ) , so the wires fall naturally between your head and pinna and the earbuds are just outside your ear canals . With one hand , pull the superoposterior part of the pinna in a superoposterior direction while inserting the earphone with the other . This straightens the ear canal and makes it easier to insert the earphone . ( Your doctor uses the same maneuver when he / she examines you with an otoscope . ) You may also wish to twist the earphone during insertion so that it lodges itself better . If the phones are properly inserted , they will have sealed your ear canals and you may want to relieve pressure via your Eustachian tubes ( that is , swallow ) , just as on a climbing plane or skyscraper elevator . It may seem like it takes a lot of work ( and possibly learning a bit about anatomy ) to get these earphones to work as intended . It does , and success is not guaranteed . But it 's worth it ! And to save your hearing , do n't forget to turn down the volume , since your music will no longer have to compete with outside noise",366,1,0.32327621800466366,0.0004761904761905201,0.045290637999808064,0.024505468560305367,0.0004761904761905201,0.0004761904761905201,0.0004761904761905201,0.0004761904761905201,0.0004761904761905201,0.0004761904761905201,0.0004761904761905201,0.0004761904761905201,0.0004761904761905201,0.0004761904761905201,0.032026584737482856,0.0004761904761905201,0.03184761284455232,0.0004761904761905201,0.0004761904761905201,0.0004761904761905201,0.0004761904761905201,0.0004761904761905201,0.0004761904761905201,0.0004761904761905201,0.0004761904761905201,0.03571744466205181,0.0004761904761905201,0.0004761904761905201,0.12661875124765706,0.0004761904761905201,0.0004761904761905201,0.02716650372326351,0.0004761904761905201,0.0004761904761905201,0.0004761904761905201,0.0004761904761905201,0.0004761904761905201,0.0004761904761905201,0.14130350406626402,0.19319965510633041,0.0004761904761905201,0.0004761904761905201,0.0004761904761905201,0.0004761904761905201,0.0004761904761905201,0.0004761904761905201,0.0004761904761905201,0.0004761904761905201,0.0004761904761905201,0.0004761904761905201,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
53212,2,"Amazing picture with one regret This was the largest set that would fit into my space . I also looked at the Westinghouse 37 inch HD moniter at Best Buy . The first time , I looked at the Westinghouse the picture looked a bit fuzzy . Then I read the review on CNET which said the Westinghouse picture was actually better than the Sharp . I went back to Best Buy and asked the sales person if the picture on the Westinghouse could be improved . He said it was as it good as it could be . He than said the Sharp was twice the price of the Westinghouse , so I should expect a better picture on the Sharp . In any event , I purchased the Sharp on Amazon during the recent Electronic Express Sale . On HD , the picture is amazing . It 's also quite good on regular TV . My only regret is that Toshiba has just come out with a 37inch LCD with a DVD built in . If I had known , I would have waited to check out that model",191,1,0.00044444444444447954,0.053137177850311405,0.00044444444444447954,0.04382377098504324,0.051446230240989835,0.00044444444444447954,0.04488888888889085,0.00044444444444447954,0.00044444444444447954,0.00044444444444447954,0.00044444444444447954,0.00044444444444447954,0.00044444444444447954,0.00044444444444447954,0.00044444444444447954,0.00044444444444447954,0.04611030713307622,0.35139188120859755,0.00044444444444447954,0.00044444444444447954,0.00044444444444447954,0.00044444444444447954,0.00044444444444447954,0.040418420770986736,0.00044444444444447954,0.00044444444444447954,0.00044444444444447954,0.00044444444444447954,0.00044444444444447954,0.14932669961502587,0.00044444444444447954,0.00044444444444447954,0.03656042728675454,0.00044444444444447954,0.00044444444444447954,0.00044444444444447954,0.025844275519157325,0.00044444444444447954,0.00044444444444447954,0.00044444444444447954,0.00044444444444447954,0.00044444444444447954,0.00044444444444447954,0.00044444444444447954,0.1397185871678316,0.00044444444444447954,0.00044444444444447954,0.00044444444444447954,0.00044444444444447954,0.00044444444444447954,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

53217,2,"Impressive This is a great little piece of hardware . I bought it for my MP3 's and movies , and I 'm very pleased . It 's totally "" plug - n - play "" ; there are n't even any drivers that need updating , assuming you have XP up to par . It gives 160 GB ( well , 149 in actuality ) of space to work with . After moving nearly 50 gigs over to it at once , on the first day , it froze up . After that minor incident , I 've had no problems , though , and my machine runs alot faster because of it . With my 100 G of music already on it , I 'm very happy with it . It has given me no fuss -- it does n't even give me any noise ! It 's as silent as a fart , and that 's a big plus . I found mine at Wal - Mart for $ 114 and I think that I made a good purchase . If you 're on a budget , this is about as good as it gets . Seagate 's 300 GB is also highly recommended , as I 've worked with it before .

53243,2,"works with a MacBook I thought I 'd weigh in , as the reviews suggesting noncompliance with Apple products seemed ominous . I bought a Passport , and the USB outlet on my Macbook powers it perfectly well . I do n't need an external power supply . Btw , I get a transfer rate of about 2 Mb / s , or 1 Gb/5 minutes . This seems a little slow , but it does n't bother me much . The Passport is small , has a nice rubber coating to prevent shock , and overall is worth the purchase price",102,1,0.0011111111111111725,0.23196029492174947,0.0011111111111111725,0.0011111111111111725,0.0011111111111111725,0.0011111111111111725,0.0011111111111111725,0.0011111111111111725,0.0011111111111111725,0.0011111111111111725,0.0011111111111111725,0.0011111111111111725,0.0011111111111111725,0.0011111111111111725,0.0011111111111111725,0.0011111111111111725,0.0011111111111111725,0.29438599559113154,0.05666614341608491,0.0011111111111111725,0.0011111111111111725,0.114495435183896,0.12703365218456186,0.0011111111111111725,0.07101383169825458,0.0011111111111111725,0.0011111111111111725,0.0011111111111111725,0.0011111111111111725,0.0011111111111111725,0.0011111111111111725,0.0011111111111111725,0.0011111111111111725,0.0011111111111111725,0.0011111111111111725,0.0011111111111111725,0.0011111111111111725,0.0011111111111111725,0.0011111111111111725,0.0011111111111111725,0.0011111111111111725,0.056666869226541204,0.0011111111111111725,0.0011111111111111725,0.0011111111111111725,0.0011111111111111725,0.0011111111111111725,0.0011111111111111725,0.0011111111111111725,0.0011111111111111725,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1
53250,2,"good , could be easily improved I am running the RadioShark on a G4 PowerBook w/ Mac OS X 10.4 . I am very happy with the programmed recording - saves to a variety of formats , etc . Very handy ! The unit did all that it promised , but it could have had much better software . A Dashboard Widget is also included that controls basic operation , but not recording or EQ.Needed additions:1 . Station presets are selected from a drop down menu ? ? ! ? One has to go to the RS menu bar ( top of screen ) to find the favorite Stations - kind of klunky . Better to have "" radio buttons "" associated with the App window . To be fair , the Widget does have better station selection , but the button is labeled with a ' heart' ... 2 . No station "" scan "" function . One has to dink through the entire spectrum manually - wow - hard to understand this lack of functionality.3 . Some additional audio filter / edit functions could be included . There is a multi - band EQ that works well , mostly ( see comment below ) . At minimum there should be a hiss filter and a hum filter with variable levels of effect . Also , one should be able to edit out unessential material from an audio file . Though , for Mac OS X there is a nice freeware app that can do this : AUDACITY.Oddities1 . When first installed , the output had static in it which was worse with the EQ on . Griffin Tech Support was not very helpful - as with most tech support offerings , they failed to grasp the actual problem and replied with unhelpful suggestions .

53285,2,"Sweet sounding plugs ! First off , these puppies sound good ! However , there are things anyone intending to buy these earphones should know : The sound is loud and crisp but definetely mid - trebley , as with most in - ear headphones . The low end is there , but for full effect , it takes to position the earphones just so in your ear canal at the right volume . Since they tend to slide out of the ear canal as one moves , this sweet spot is not very wide . That said , however , I recognize the difficlulty of delivering earth shaking bass in a device this small . Most bass - rich systems utilize either massive speakers/ woofers or chambered enclosures ( or both ) to deliver . Since the size of this type of headphones does n't permit for either big speakers or special chambers , maybe the thing to do is to use the human cranium as the resonating chamber ! I am yet to find any in ear headphones that really deliver bass to die for . Such is the difficulty to get big bass in so compact a package . Maybe the 5 and 7 series are better in this regard ( for the price they better be ) . So if you really need earth shaking bass in your playback , look into buying those pricey phones . The lack of such bass is the only reason i did n't give it five stars . Also , the lack of colored LEFT ( blue or white ) and RIGHT ( red ) tags on the earphones make it tricky to put on for the first time . I did n't realize I had them reversed until the pain got so unbearable I just had to check . So be careful . Riding while using them can be dangerous , since the sound isolation is so great one can barely hear jets thundering overhead . Bang for the buck , ( I paid $ 69.99 on amazon ) , I really recommend these headphones to all but big bass aficionados .",363,1,0.11353824017659105,0.026011508409074232,0.0003174603174603515,0.0003174603174603515,0.03255155894057075,0.0003174603174603515,0.016291345440911074,0.019706116764727402,0.0003174603174603515,0.0003174603174603515,0.05848165640188775,0.0003174603174603515,0.26180823047005314,0.0003174603174603515,0.016190476190475735,0.0003174603174603515,0.05718833771173542,0.035317750248269365,0.0003174603174603515,0.0003174603174603515,0.0003174603174603515,0.0003174603174603515,0.0003174603174603515,0.01791480678275759,0.023618536402980547,0.0003174603174603515,0.0003174603174603515,0.0003174603174603515,0.16445856258132543,0.06926573720271087,0.0003174603174603515,0.0003174603174603515,0.0003174603174603515,0.0003174603174603515,0.0003174603174603515,0.019022170818675143,0.0003174603174603515,0.0003174603174603515,0.0003174603174603515,0.0003174603174603515,0.0003174603174603515,0.0003174603174603515,0.0003174603174603515,0.0003174603174603515,0.0003174603174603515,0.0003174603174603515,0.05784131466360242,0.0003174603174603515,0.0003174603174603515,0.0003174603174603515,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

Turning them off could be annoying ( requires precise timing)My experience : I 've had two pairs of these for over a year and I like them very much . I enjoy great sound watching TV or listening to music while everybody is asleep . This is really great , I can enjoy music at comfortable levels at any time of the day or night . The sound is much better and clearer than the sound produced by the speakers of the TV . You have the same clarity and volume even though you might be moving around the rooms away from the TV ( closet or the garage for example ) . The headphones are light and very comfortable . I tried other brands and the aw771 were the most comfortable by far . So , overall wonderful product . However , there a few flaws to be aware of . Consider the following before buying . It might require several attempts before the unit tunes in at the right channel . Sometimes , turning the headphones ON results in poor reception if any at all . To correct this , you have to press the only button ( power , search , and turn off ) and wait until the unit picks the signal at the right channel . You might have to repeat this operation two or three times and it is a bit annoying . Once you get good reception , everything is ok although you might get some interference ( alien noises ) when you turn your head or move around . The last problem is with the turn off button ( again the only multifunction button ) . You need to press and hold the button for a certain amount of seconds and release it in order to turn off the unit . That is not always easy and usually the unit comes back on . You think you turned it off but it is still on and if it 's not in the charger base you drain the batteries completely . Well , I hope my description is helpful . Regardless of the flaws , I recommend the AW771 . I use them every day and best of all I enjoy great sound when other people are asleep .",447,1,0.000253164556962049,0.07245442365784009,0.020928187159923676,0.05292398142853962,0.09964383120959731,0.000253164556962049,0.000253164556962049,0.000253164556962049,0.02352999467140084,0.000253164556962049,0.045008041041352066,0.022671822751543294,0.12422106435430814,0.000253164556962049,0.012911392405062304,0.000253164556962049,0.000253164556962049,0.000253164556962049,0.000253164556962049,0.07009608050639789,0.000253164556962049,0.000253164556962049,0.0860008622180954,0.0712442050209582,0.014860437167075078,0.000253164556962049,0.000253164556962049,0.000253164556962049,0.16430280017890836,0.000253164556962049,0.000253164556962049,0.000253164556962049,0.0477385487037568,0.000253164556962049,0.000253164556962049,0.000253164556962049,0.000253164556962049,0.000253164556962049,0.028232644974325913,0.000253164556962049,0.000253164556962049,0.013265739943058675,0.000253164556962049,0.000253164556962049,0.000253164556962049,0.000253164556962049,0.0218646767850708,0.000253164556962049,0.000253164556962049,0.000253164556962049,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

53327,2,"I payed my $ 45 for these headphones and enjoyed them . I 'm going to cover compatiblity , sound , and comfort . OVERVIEW.Although I wish these were as cheap as the IPOD , $ 39 + $ 6 shipping is nt bad either . I have done the heat treatment ( using boiling water ) and the headphones seemed to open up more . When the headphones came in the box , the ear pieces were really close together . So I can easily see how these bands can crack easily when put on your head . I plan to heat treat these again to spread them out more . SOUND.Sound quality is excellent . COMFORT.The only thing I do n't really like is this style of headphone . I do n't really like the band to go around the back of my head , causing my ears to support the headphones . I like the ones that go over the top of your head . COMPATIBILITY.I have a Inspiron DELL Laptop and these suckers can connect to it easily without using a transmitter . These can also connect to just about any MP3 player of all sizes ( PSP also ) because it comes with a small 8 mm jack extension cord . FEATURES.Coolest features with this compared to my other IR sony wireless headphones is that this can go through walls !

53342,2,"works pretty well with stereo hook - up My sound improvement was n't as dramatic as many people describe , likely because I already had my computer wired to a good reciever and speakers , but I did notice an improvement over the integrated system I have once I made some adjustments . If you listen to rock , pop , blues or jazz , this card can make everything seem a bit brighter and punchier . It also seems to improve Pandora internet radio streams even more than my mp3 's , though I have to keep the volume at about 3/4 in the Pandora player to prevent distortion . If you mostly listen to classical on a good stereo , I 'm not sure if this card will do much for the sound , but it might",139,1,0.0011764705882353356,0.0011764705882353356,0.0011764705882353356,0.0011764705882353356,0.0011764705882353356,0.0011764705882353356,0.06000000944717339,0.0011764705882353356,0.0011764705882353356,0.0011764705882353356,0.07032261905075612,0.0011764705882353356,0.0011764705882353356,0.0011764705882353356,0.0011764705882353356,0.0011764705882353356,0.0011764705882353356,0.0011764705882353356,0.0011764705882353356,0.0011764705882353356,0.0011764705882353356,0.37044187021453984,0.0011764705882353356,0.0011764705882353356,0.0011764705882353356,0.0011764705882353356,0.0011764705882353356,0.0011764705882353356,0.1305363303784373,0.0601389234503207,0.0011764705882353356,0.0011764705882353356,0.0011764705882353356,0.0011764705882353356,0.0011764705882353356,0.0011764705882353356,0.0011764705882353356,0.0011764705882353356,0.0011764705882353356,0.1106061447369557,0.0011764705882353356,0.0011764705882353356,0.0011764705882353356,0.0011764705882353356,0.0011764705882353356,0.0011764705882353356,0.1473658674276976,0.0011764705882353356,0.0011764705882353356,0.0011764705882353356,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1

53367,2,"Great for the price Bottom line up front : Works very well , very low price , works much better with the included drivers than with the generic windows xp driverDetailed review : I bought this so I could use my new Treo 700w with my non - bluetooth - enabled laptop . The price was my main motivation in buying it . Initially I just plugged it in and used the default windows xp drivers and it worked okay , however it did n't always work and i 'd have to unplug / replug for my phone and the device to find and talk to each other . After getting tired of that , I decided to install the drivers that ship with the product . I 've had a much better experience since i did that . I was afraid the software would be really clunky given the cheap price , but it 's actually quite good and gives you a TON of options that the standard XP driver does not provide . If you use a this with a laptop and you dock / undock it , you 'll have much better luck if you stop the adapter prior to docking / undocking . Otherwise , you 'll probably end up having to unplug / replug it",220,1,0.00040816326530614594,0.00040816326530614594,0.00040816326530614594,0.00040816326530614594,0.1379297126330551,0.00040816326530614594,0.00040816326530614594,0.00040816326530614594,0.00040816326530614594,0.00040816326530614594,0.024795047698792087,0.041052034448839016,0.00040816326530614594,0.00040816326530614594,0.020816326530611256,0.00040816326530614594,0.00040816326530614594,0.04845503725175646,0.00040816326530614594,0.00040816326530614594,0.00040816326530614594,0.00040816326530614594,0.046314544566634336,0.00040816326530614594,0.00040816326530614594,0.00040816326530614594,0.04392397735172903,0.00040816326530614594,0.00040816326530614594,0.00040816326530614594,0.00040816326530614594,0.00040816326530614594,0.14995364190146934,0.00040816326530614594,0.00040816326530614594,0.00040816326530614594,0.00040816326530614594,0.00040816326530614594,0.07242541420437647,0.00040816326530614594,0.00040816326530614594,0.00040816326530614594,0.00040816326530614594,0.00040816326530614594,0.32676314395971423,0.00040816326530614594,0.07165275210608298,0.00040816326530614594,0.00040816326530614594,0.00040816326530614594,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0

53380,2,"Best phone I have used I work at a home office so I am on the phone lot . I always buy cordless phones I can use with a headset so I can have both arms free while I talk with a min of background noise intrusion . In other words , I do n't talk with the phone cradled between my shoulder and ear . And I do n't use speaker phone features . Let 's just get that out of the way now since those are things some have complained about that I could n't care less about . This phone first of all looks good and FEELS good . It was built with high quality plastics and metals on all surfaces . It has a nice solid weight to itself . Nothing tacky or cheap about it . It looks far better in person than it ever did in pictures . And it looks pretty good in pictures . I like how the bases are designed such that the antennas serve a double purpose as cradle supports for when the phone is docked . Clever design . The charging base light and back - lit buttons all look very slick . The screen is attractive . A big step up from back - lit LCDs or no screen at all like my previous phone . I like that you can very quickly find and hit Mute , adjust volume , and page through your caller history . The belt clip goes deep so the phone stays snugly attached to you pocket when you are walking around . I know many 5.8 GHz phones do n't mention that only one direction of communication is at that frequency vs. both directions ( as 2.4 GHz sometimes gets used too ) . I do n't know for sure if this phone falls into that category , but I was in the market for a 5.8 GHz phone to avoid interference with my WiFi networks as well as to avoid microwave oven interference with my calls . One thing 's for sure : this phone definitely is immune from MY microwave oven . In the past when I was on a call heating up my coffee , static and voice quality went way down unless I got far away from the oven . With this new phone I can stand right by it while on High w/o ANY impact on voice quality . One other very cool feature is the spare battery charger . While it 's nice that the battery can replace a unit that runs down in a handset right away , the best part is if you have a power failure . Your phone will keep truckin ' and there is never a need to replace that battery with some short lived 9volt waste of time . Finally , I like how the phone by a bedside basically doubles as a digital clock . The phone base unit picks up the current time from the caller ID info provided by the phone company and uses that info to automatically set and broadcast the current time to all headsets and base station . No need to manually set the clock . And when not in use , sitting it is dock , the phone 's screen displays the time . So far I 've found the voice quality to be best of any cordless phone I 've owned",579,1,0.1365649297043917,0.09525261416511802,0.04805496645743442,0.00016000000000001533,0.00016000000000001533,0.00016000000000001533,0.014927581694389415,0.00016000000000001533,0.0887987888926178,0.00016000000000001533,0.00016000000000001533,0.00016000000000001533,0.11383742457797082,0.00016000000000001533,0.00016000000000001533,0.00016000000000001533,0.00016000000000001533,0.013488886882530996,0.00016000000000001533,0.00016000000000001533,0.00016000000000001533,0.00016000000000001533,0.04813970857411964,0.00016000000000001533,0.010045910451402773,0.022733428057403908,0.2168156327670029,0.00016000000000001533,0.00016000000000001533,0.00016000000000001533,0.00016000000000001533,0.00816997790310222,0.1179499368209934,0.00016000000000001533,0.00016000000000001533,0.00016000000000001533,0.00016000000000001533,0.00016000000000001533,0.00016000000000001533,0.00016000000000001533,0.00016000000000001533,0.008529522777969685,0.00016000000000001533,0.00016000000000001533,0.00016000000000001533,0.008671803092229797,0.04257888718132187,0.00016000000000001533,0.00016000000000001533,0.00016000000000001533,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0

53387,2,"A great audio compliment With so many of these ipod speaker docks on the market , it was sort of struggle to decide . Ultimately , I felt very comfortable going with the Bose brand . Plus , in my opinion , this is about the sleakest and best - looking unit out there ( I went with black ; I 'm not an Apple - white drone ) . The sound is very , very good for small to medium size spaces . There are not a lot of features to the unit , which I think is a good thing - it just focuses on the sound and the small footprint . Mini remote control work well and again the small size makes it unimposing in this world of too many remotes .

53403,2,"Dash Mount -- very helpful I got the dash mount because a friend recommended it . I thought the windshield mount worked fine except it was difficult to remove from the windshield . I felt like I should remove it each time I parked somewhere . Also , there was a fair amount of vibration since it usually was dangling . The dash mount is very heavy and flexible enough to "" mold "" to fit the surface of the dash . However , it kept slipping off the surface of my Toyota Avalon until I found a little sticky pad to put it on . That solved that problem .

53435,2,"Wish I 'd bought this sooner ! I 'm not much of a techie . But , I do have lots of documents and pictures that I ca n't bear to lose should my computer decide to konk out one day . I used to back up my most important files on CD : an overly complex and tedious process involving multiple CDs and lots of time . But , with this 2 GB flash drive backing up my important documents is just a matter of plugging the device in and selecting which files and folders to synchronize . The files are copied over to the device quickly , and easily . The 2 Gig storage capacity allows me to backup all of my most important photos and documents on one handy removeable drive . ScanDisk even includes a "" Synch "" software that simplifies the process of identifying and copying your important data . ( The software also helps you copy over your Outlook messages , folders , appointments , tasks , and other data that used to be difficult for me to find on my hard drive . ) Also , I can imagine that the use of the Synch software with this little drive would made it very easy to keep the data on your work machine syched up with the data on your home machine . Physically , the unit is small , sleek with a case that feels substantial . The retractable connector functions smoothly and allows the case to protect the connector when not in use . This thing is great .

53450,2,"Not bad at all ! I have some decent mics in my cabinet , as well as a nice preamp , A / D converter and fire wire interface for my home multitracking setup . I was n't expecting as good or better quality than I can already get , but I hoped the Samson C01B USB Studio Condenser would at least give me a decent sound . The idea was to have freedom and portablility that my studio set up prohibits . I was not disappointed . Installation was no more complicated that plugging the cable into a USB port on my laptop running XP and the other end into the mic . It is far from the best mic I have , but it is certainly not the worst . I have read reviews that say the recording quality is too thin , but I found that not to be the case . The noise floor when recording with the Samson is a little high , and it is lacking in headroom compared to any traditional mic through my Millenia preamp .

53459,2,"Best of the bunch , and pretty good anyway The 6500B was the last one I tried of three . I 've had cordless Panasonic phones break too often in the past so was reluctant to buy one again . But the other choices had major drawbacks . I really needed a two - line phone that was n't 2.4Ghz . The first I tried was the Uniden TRU8866 . It had a bad echo on the extra handset and other people complained about that too . This phone uses phone company voice mail ( no built - in ans mach ) - which is fine - but I had the VM system go bonkers so lost all trust in it . For over a week messages accumulated but we got no stutter - tone so did n't know there were any new messages - arrgghh . Not the phones fault I know but it required VM for messaging so nope . Next I tried the new Motorola MD7081 . I really wanted to like this phone . It 's a 2-line 5.8Ghz ans machine like the Panasonic 6500B. I liked it 's simplicity and easy switching between line 1 and 2 . Had battery backup for use during power outages and the best voice quality of the three . But , it 's answering system has no message counter . That alone is no big deal but it did n't have any indicator to say whether you had any saved messages . When a new message arrived it blinked and such - all good . But , if I got home , say , and listened to a message for my wife , the blinking stopped and no indication of "" 1 saved message "" or anything . So , I would have to write a note to her to check the messages . We 're so used to relying on seeing a message counter and just listening to them if it 's not zero that we thought this would become a nuisance . I also would have liked an auto - line - selection so it would automatically answer the ringing line or select a non - busy outgoing line . But , that would have messed up their simpler style button function - hmmm . The Panasonic , I am surprised to say , ended up being my favorite . Hopefully it will be reliable . I was always bothered by Panasonic 's phones losing the date / time with any little power outage . Happily , this phone sets its date / time from caller - id info even though the manual implies it would n't work quite that way . With the right settings and phone company options ( busy - forward ) , it elegantly supports two lines as if they are one . I really like not thinking about which line is what - just pick up and talk . The 6500B has good voice quality and reasonable range . It 's much lighter than earlier caller - id handsets which I like . I also like their shape of handset the best . My gripes are the limit of 4 handsets - I would like 6 or 7 . Also , ca n't name the handsets so with intercom you have to remember each number",563,1,0.00020408163265308096,0.00020408163265308096,0.04707778688122803,0.0142746234460699,0.03776944442953292,0.00020408163265308096,0.00020408163265308096,0.00020408163265308096,0.057440292999341384,0.00020408163265308096,0.00020408163265308096,0.00020408163265308096,0.2349204242635665,0.00020408163265308096,0.00020408163265308096,0.00020408163265308096,0.00020408163265308096,0.01469391011715278,0.00020408163265308096,0.00020408163265308096,0.00020408163265308096,0.11471300621922088,0.012299845956966047,0.00020408163265308096,0.00020408163265308096,0.00020408163265308096,0.18559421844836083,0.00020408163265308096,0.00020408163265308096,0.00020408163265308096,0.00020408163265308096,0.00020408163265308096,0.00020408163265308096,0.00020408163265308096,0.00020408163265308096,0.00020408163265308096,0.00020408163265308096,0.00020408163265308096,0.03008558689613477,0.00020408163265308096,0.042239883978742156,0.0206122448979596,0.00020408163265308096,0.00020408163265308096,0.10045637979299352,0.034975408632615904,0.04570408589725708,0.00020408163265308096,0.00020408163265308096,0.00020408163265308096,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0
53479,2,"A Good Wireless Mouse for a Notebook but consider the Bluetooth option V270 . The V200 is another great Logitech product . It is far from the king of the mouse , but when it comes to the notebook it does n't get much better than this . It takes two AA batteries ( so get some rechargeable batteries to save on costs ) which slide into the top of the mouse by pulling back on the palm rest to reveal two slots . The mouse does n't weigh too much heavier than the two mouse batteries themselves . This is a two button mouse with a tilt wheel . With the setpoint software you can alter what the buttons do . Overall the design is good . There could be a problem installing setpoint . It may hang on install . If so you need to use the task manager to quit the install and then try it again . It should work . The USB receiver is 2.4 GHz and has a 10 Meter range . Wow . However there is one major problem with a wireless mouse for a notebook . USB dongles and receivers that are plugged into the side of the laptop are just begging to be snapped off . For this reason you should have the USB receiver on the side opposite the mouse hand , if you can , to avoid accidental contact . It should also not be hanging over the edge of the table . If you press it down lightly , then that is it , game over for the receiver and you will have to get a new 2.4 GHz receiver . So okay you will have to spend on a new receiver , if you break the old one . The receiver plugs into a small slot under the mouse using a magnet . When it is in the holder the mouse turns off . It does n't fit in smoothly . It creates a block shape in the bottom of the mouse . Anyway you are not going to be using it when it is clipped in . The other thing is that it can pop out sometimes . Just happens if the mouse just gets knocked a certain way . I am sure most notebook users are cautious with their notebooks and devices . If you are then a mouse like this and USB should last for a very long time . There is really nothing wrong with it . Wireless mini mouse . FAB ! However there is one last thing to say . If you do n't like the idea of a USB receiver then GET A BLUETOOTH VERSION OF THIS MOUSE INSTEAD . It is called the V270 . That is if your notebook has internal Bluetooth or else you will need to get a Bluetooth USB receiver and be in the same boat when it comes to watching your USB receivers . But if you have a Bluetooth internal receiver with your notebook then by all means head over to the V270 and forget about this USB option . The USB design is n't a fault with the mouse ; it is just a fault with all notebooks that is not really a fault . You just got to switch to internal Bluetooth or learn to take care of your receivers .",570,1,0.13128056682797518,0.10091683225719449,0.016432946969385336,0.017721995040185012,0.00023809523809526065,0.00023809523809526065,0.00023809523809526065,0.00023809523809526065,0.044190857612677485,0.00023809523809526065,0.00023809523809526065,0.00023809523809526065,0.10347762415282559,0.00023809523809526065,0.00023809523809526065,0.00023809523809526065,0.0953489109556936,0.00023809523809526065,0.00023809523809526065,0.00023809523809526065,0.00023809523809526065,0.00023809523809526065,0.29098200901311166,0.038106619529303255,0.00023809523809526065,0.00023809523809526065,0.00023809523809526065,0.00023809523809526065,0.00023809523809526065,0.00023809523809526065,0.00023809523809526065,0.00023809523809526065,0.03972569539574548,0.00023809523809526065,0.00023809523809526065,0.00023809523809526065,0.00023809523809526065,0.00023809523809526065,0.00023809523809526065,0.00023809523809526065,0.00023809523809526065,0.00023809523809526065,0.00023809523809526065,0.00023809523809526065,0.08213778129188279,0.00023809523809526065,0.030630541906400518,0.00023809523809526065,0.00023809523809526065,0.00023809523809526065,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0

53491,2,"This was just what I wanted Before I bought this device , I was trying to enjoy the "" Hearts of Space "" website , "" This American Life "" and other NPR shows available for online streaming . Only problem was , I did n't like being shackled to my computer in order to hear them . I did some research on the internet , read a lot of reviews and ultimately decided on the Logitech Wireless Music System . I would like to echo all the positive comments recorded here . It was indeed quite fast and easy to set up . No lengthy manuals to read ( thank goodness . ) I did not find it necessary to load the CD software that came with the device . If I want to listen through the stereo , I plug in the USB . If I want to listen through the computer , I simply unplug the USB . It 's very simple . I am 100 % satisfied with the sound quality . I would not be able to tell the difference between FM radio and the online streaming . However , I do have to turn up my stereo about twice as loud when I am sending internet audio streams to it using this device , than when I am listening to a CD or the radio . On my stereo ( which is n't fancy ) , this does not cause diminished sound quality , so I 'm perfectly OK with it . I just have to remember to turn down the volume before switching back to CD or radio listening . If you are wondering whether the device will be compatible with your stereo , check for two things . First , your stereo has to have a set of two holes side - by - side that are for the twin plugs generally colored white and red . I 'm sorry I do not know the technical names for these things , but there 's a picture of the red - and - white plugs on this Amazon page in the Manufacturer 's "" Product Description "" section ( just scroll up until you see it . ) Second , your stereo has to have a button that will let you switch to "" Auxiliary "" input . My stereo has this , but my portable CD player / cassette player / radio ( AKA boom box ) does not . If it is important to you to be able to use this on a portable player you can carry around the house and/or outside , be sure to check your player for these two things . Overall I am very satisfied and quite happy with the product",465,1,0.00023529411764708856,0.00023529411764708856,0.03870875440548118,0.01017868981277211,0.023701408015593332,0.00023529411764708856,0.023766529964122863,0.00023529411764708856,0.00023529411764708856,0.00023529411764708856,0.027565993206511166,0.00023529411764708856,0.2340577880473977,0.00023529411764708856,0.00023529411764708856,0.00023529411764708856,0.00023529411764708856,0.05991214130964014,0.00023529411764708856,0.05509305119404388,0.00023529411764708856,0.00023529411764708856,0.04149739284100248,0.00023529411764708856,0.030300038209834398,0.03812118421199669,0.00023529411764708856,0.00023529411764708856,0.03564035763247843,0.020495356157026627,0.00023529411764708856,0.015463498476878291,0.00023529411764708856,0.00023529411764708856,0.00023529411764708856,0.0354951099127623,0.04175780204752584,0.00023529411764708856,0.14980014207862097,0.09778557885435228,0.00023529411764708856,0.00023529411764708856,0.013365065974899781,0.00023529411764708856,0.00023529411764708856,0.00023529411764708856,0.00023529411764708856,0.00023529411764708856,0.00023529411764708856,0.00023529411764708856,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

53516,2,"Great I was looking for something suitable to house my sansa , and this fit the bill better than most . The leather case is superb , looking sharp , snug and protective . I enjoy the fact you can still easily access the buttons and menus through it . Both the leather case and the larger case have an atachee on the back , if you wished to connect them to the cord that comes with it . The cleaning cloth works as well as any lense cloth , great for cleaning . The screen protector is a pain in the rear to apply without bubbles , still have n't figured out how yet , and I may trim it to make it more visually appealing . But , really , if you invest in a product such as this , it really makes sense to protect the easily scratched screen ! The larger case is compact and protective , having a small storage area , yet the cover is a bit unsightly because of the cheap , generic looking Sansa logo . Only other complaint is that the leather case goes on a belt , but not as a removable type . Only if you put it on when putting on the belt , which can be impractical in some circumstances .

53539,2,"Good I bought this battery pack for a 10 day trip to Italy and I am very happy with it . I never had to change my batteries once and I listened to it all the time . Reading other people 's reviews I threw out the batteries it came with and used different ones and it worked great . The only complaint I have is the suction cups are n't that great . Several times my Ipod came off the suction cups and being on a plane with minimal room and people sitting next to me trying to get my ipod off the floor is not fun . Overall , I recommend this product . It is a little bulky , but if you 're someone like me who can not live without music , it 's a great product to have if you are n't going to be able to charge your Ipod",155,1,0.0005128205128205587,0.0005128205128205587,0.0005128205128205587,0.05177849322427678,0.08700329413937848,0.0005128205128205587,0.0005128205128205587,0.08393116794891789,0.0005128205128205587,0.0005128205128205587,0.1406064013344236,0.0005128205128205587,0.21890621357369555,0.0005128205128205587,0.0005128205128205587,0.0005128205128205587,0.0005128205128205587,0.0005128205128205587,0.0005128205128205587,0.0005128205128205587,0.0005128205128205587,0.0005128205128205587,0.04591857810659249,0.0005128205128205587,0.030575473901225236,0.0005128205128205587,0.0005128205128205587,0.0005128205128205587,0.10943029246260459,0.0005128205128205587,0.0005128205128205587,0.0005128205128205587,0.15341204995712346,0.0005128205128205587,0.05792521483893955,0.0005128205128205587,0.0005128205128205587,0.0005128205128205587,0.0005128205128205587,0.0005128205128205587,0.0005128205128205587,0.0005128205128205587,0.0005128205128205587,0.0005128205128205587,0.0005128205128205587,0.0005128205128205587,0.0005128205128205587,0.0005128205128205587,0.0005128205128205587,0.0005128205128205587,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
53541,2,"awesome ! ! I 'm really happy with this purchase . I was worried that it would not work with Rhapsody ( which is the media player I use the most ) , but it proved to work well with it . In fact , it works with all the media player I 've thrown at it , including Windows Media Player , MediaLife , RealPlayer , iTunes , Rhapsody , DivX Player , WinDVD , and PowerDVD . All the buttons are functional ( and I worship functionality - hence the 5 stars ) , although Firefox users have to deal with extra configuration steps to make the back and forward button work . No biggies , though , since setting up is really easy . Basically all you have to do is open the SetPoint software that was installed with the driver , point to the intended buttons that you want to program , and assign a corresponding keystroke to it . In this case , it 's Alt+Right for forward button and Alt+Left for back button . Click "" Apply "" and you 're good to go a - browsin'!!Battery life so far is really good - it 's been going on the same set of Duracell AA batteries since I got it 3 months ago , and still going strong . The RF range is really good , although admittedly my room is n't big enough to really put its range to the test . Dorm - dweller users should be happy with the range , though . You could just lie on your bed and only lift one finger to control your music or movie . This mouse is also great looking ; not cheap - plasticky but actually sharp and slick . It does feel a bit odd to the grip when using as a remote control , but as a mouse it 's really sturdy and ergonomic . I ca n't comment on installation since it 's been a while since I first used it , but I guess no impression is good impression - if it was troublesome I 'm sure I 'd remember . I'd second the other reviewer 's gripe about how most cordless keyboards come with a mouse , and this fantastic mouse does n't come with a cordless keyboard ... But it 's a great buy , all in all",402,1,0.0002597402597402818,0.04821750331584245,0.0002597402597402818,0.0002597402597402818,0.05759043008929071,0.0002597402597402818,0.0002597402597402818,0.0002597402597402818,0.0002597402597402818,0.0002597402597402818,0.0002597402597402818,0.0002597402597402818,0.14258560907377846,0.0002597402597402818,0.0002597402597402818,0.0002597402597402818,0.06334350884348651,0.018261660401421128,0.0002597402597402818,0.0002597402597402818,0.0002597402597402818,0.11274862773704471,0.15633381937418167,0.0002597402597402818,0.028265149166128538,0.024636896589404694,0.0002597402597402818,0.0002597402597402818,0.04429388544294135,0.0002597402597402818,0.0002597402597402818,0.0002597402597402818,0.03613133927084531,0.0002597402597402818,0.0002597402597402818,0.0002597402597402818,0.0002597402597402818,0.0002597402597402818,0.0002597402597402818,0.1144805766290846,0.03959621604539299,0.0002597402597402818,0.013492144246146597,0.0002597402597402818,0.09093172468410049,0.0002597402597402818,0.0002597402597402818,0.0002597402597402818,0.0002597402597402818,0.0002597402597402818,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

Needless to say I 'm ordering more to complete the job . The monster fiber optic cable is a must as well . I can hear sounds that I normally could n't on my old system . I like testing sound with : The Hulk ( the scene were he tears up the tanks ) , Saving Private Ryan ( taking the beach ) , and Open Range ( Gunfight at the end of the movie ) . In all these movies there are small sounds that you can distinctly hear now that I could not before the new wire and connectors .

53557,2,"More bang for your buck . This is my first mp3 player so I researched it carefully before making my decision . The gorgeous screen , the wide number of codecs it supports and the 30 gb hard drive were all selling points . I 'm so glad I bought it . Videos look great on the screen . Some need to be converted over which is a slow process but in general I love it . The built in speaker does n't do it justice . Even on the included earbuds the sounds quality is amazing . Making playlists with the creative software is very easy . My biggest problem is the lag of accessories for it . No case , no screen protectors out for it . I 'd love to see a docking station that lets you record to it as a dvr the way the archos players do . But for the money it looks to me to be a far superior player to the Ipod or the Zune .",174,1,0.0006451612903226183,0.0006451612903226183,0.03483568467886447,0.0006451612903226183,0.02450761280058063,0.0006451612903226183,0.03541056315858316,0.0006451612903226183,0.1387986022862423,0.0006451612903226183,0.0006451612903226183,0.0006451612903226183,0.0006451612903226183,0.0006451612903226183,0.0006451612903226183,0.0006451612903226183,0.0006451612903226183,0.0370704689786085,0.0328127581016219,0.0006451612903226183,0.0006451612903226183,0.0006451612903226183,0.07076752993466276,0.0006451612903226183,0.0006451612903226183,0.07598955826810798,0.0006451612903226183,0.0006451612903226183,0.03290322580645056,0.0006451612903226183,0.0006451612903226183,0.0006451612903226183,0.06540240507691432,0.0006451612903226183,0.0006451612903226183,0.0006451612903226183,0.0006451612903226183,0.0006451612903226183,0.0006451612903226183,0.29303628647723695,0.0006451612903226183,0.03290324685590425,0.0006451612903226183,0.0006451612903226183,0.0006451612903226183,0.10169108983428536,0.0006451612903226183,0.0006451612903226183,0.0006451612903226183,0.0006451612903226183,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

53589,2,"A Top - Notch Universal DVD Player There 's no need to take anybody else 's word for specs on this Sony DVD player when you can view or download , for free , the user 's manual at http://esupport.sony.com/US/perl/model-documents.pl?mdl=DVPNS90V and LOC=3 . I 've been running this Sony DVP - NS90V player through a Sony widescreen HDTV and a Pioneer amplifier / receiver for several days now , and I find almost none of the problems and limitations mentioned by previous reviewers . One , for example , states that there is "" no bass management , "" yet you can ( a ) route more or less signal to the subwoofer by selecting "" small "" or "" large "" for the front speaker size ( see page 76 of the user 's manual ) , and also ( b ) increase or decrease the bass from -15 dB to +5 dB ( see page 77 of the manual ) . Whether you prefer analog to digital audio , or you think SACD 's are tops , is a matter of opinion , taste and choice and not an objective evaluation of a playback unit . I , for one , prefer DVD - Audio , and I mention this for an important reason : Some product ads and the user 's manual clearly warn that this unit "" will NOT play DVD - Audio discs . "" Happy surprize : it most certainly will ! For my DVD - A 's that have optional Dolby 5.1 and/or DTS tracks , the player simply ignores the primary DVD - A format ( normally output via the 6 analog cable connectors ) but still plays the Dolby or the DTS via the digital audio ( optical or coaxial ) connectors . For "" pure "" DVD - A 's ( without Dolby 5.1 or DTS tracks ) , it conveniently outputs the audio BOTH via the 6 analog AND the digital connectors . And in all cases above , the audio is full multi - channel surround , and not downmixed to 2-channel PCM , nor Prologic pseudo - surround . The only DVD - A function it lacks is the video slideshow often included on DVD - A 's , and so displays only the "" jacket image "" onscreen . The Quick Setup allows any DVD newbie to be up and running in a short time . And the Custom Setup is so detailed with so many fine tweaks and trouble - shooters that it 's bound to please even the high - end audio - video geek - freaks . In short , you 'll find this to be a superior universal player , provided you read the user 's manual ( all 84 pages of it ! ) , follow it , and connect equally high - quality , compatible equipment capable of exploiting its many fine features",493,1,0.0003225806451613255,0.0003225806451613255,0.08759755770188185,0.016451612903222747,0.0003225806451613255,0.0003225806451613255,0.0003225806451613255,0.0003225806451613255,0.039649912433083676,0.0003225806451613255,0.016413536582356156,0.0003225806451613255,0.0003225806451613255,0.0003225806451613255,0.032580645161291756,0.0003225806451613255,0.0003225806451613255,0.2405106424147379,0.0003225806451613255,0.0003225806451613255,0.0003225806451613255,0.0003225806451613255,0.03529317683909713,0.0003225806451613255,0.06529584992410774,0.0003225806451613255,0.0003225806451613255,0.0003225806451613255,0.0003225806451613255,0.0003225806451613255,0.0003225806451613255,0.0003225806451613255,0.0003225806451613255,0.0003225806451613255,0.0003225806451613255,0.0003225806451613255,0.16815903847256933,0.0003225806451613255,0.07526609709313933,0.13635421639429032,0.0003225806451613255,0.0003225806451613255,0.0003225806451613255,0.0003225806451613255,0.0003225806451613255,0.0741696495640917,0.0003225806451613255,0.0003225806451613255,0.0003225806451613255,0.0003225806451613255,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

53595,2,"Quality Cable I ordered the 4 meter cable which was pictured with 24 pin connectors and received one with 18 pins . Found out that the missing middle 6 pins are used to transmit audio which my monitor does n't support anyway . Originally , the DVI - D specification allowed for both a video signal and an audio signal , but most manufacturer 's have only used the video portion . If you need a DVI - D cable , an 18 pin connector will most likely work since most devices wo n't process the audio signal anyway . There are a few ( very few ) devices that do use all 24 pins , but with the advent of HDMI , nobody really makes them anymore",128,1,0.16117623975164957,0.0010526315789474185,0.0547684856149227,0.0010526315789474185,0.0010526315789474185,0.0010526315789474185,0.0010526315789474185,0.0010526315789474185,0.0010526315789474185,0.0010526315789474185,0.0010526315789474185,0.053684210526314904,0.0010526315789474185,0.0010526315789474185,0.0010526315789474185,0.0010526315789474185,0.0010526315789474185,0.2386049858539587,0.0010526315789474185,0.0010526315789474185,0.0010526315789474185,0.0010526315789474185,0.0724916171115141,0.0010526315789474185,0.0010526315789474185,0.0010526315789474185,0.0010526315789474185,0.0010526315789474185,0.0010526315789474185,0.0010526315789474185,0.0010526315789474185,0.0010526315789474185,0.0010526315789474185,0.0010526315789474185,0.0010526315789474185,0.0010526315789474185,0.0010526315789474185,0.0010526315789474185,0.0010526315789474185,0.0010526315789474185,0.0010526315789474185,0.0010526315789474185,0.0010526315789474185,0.0010526315789474185,0.0010526315789474185,0.2242844310378502,0.14972687220905098,0.0010526315789474185,0.0010526315789474185,0.0010526315789474185,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1

53611,2,"What is this for ? High quality Audio and Video BREAKING NEWS : If you are buying a new video playback capable iPod , please look for the new iPod Universal dock , which has s - Video output for both photos and video . It is also ready to accept a control remote so you can control your iPod from your sofa . Is this expensive ? The answer is probably yes . This dock was included on the original iPod Photo of late 2004 ( priced $ 500-$600 ) , the dock was removed as Apple lowered the prices this year to their current levels for color iPods . However , for a couple of uses : high quality home audio and Slide Shows on hi - res TVs , it is a great alternative . This dock basically serves three purposes:- The traditional synch and charge function available since the early days.- It helps you get "" Line "" output out of an iPod . Line output is a cleaner , higher quality sound output than the usual headphone output out of the miniplug jack . It is the best way to connect your iPod to a home stereo or home theater.- The super Video out for color iPods . This function is something you can not get without the dock . So , if you like to show your pictures to your friends and family using a hi - res TV ( Plasma , LCD or a Flat Screen ) this is a great tool to use . As an alternative , if you do not want to use s - Video and are OK with regular digital video out , a cheaper alternative is the "" Apple iPod AV Cable "" at $ 19 from the Apple Store or similar alternatives . In summary , buy this if you hook your iPod to high quality audio equipment or if you regularly do hi - res slide shows on your TV . If you do n't do it , it 's just too expensive as a synch / charger , since anything you need is in the iPod box",363,1,0.0002857142857143058,0.0002857142857143058,0.12933782964273932,0.0002857142857143058,0.03282065698899717,0.0002857142857143058,0.0002857142857143058,0.0002857142857143058,0.05023316953338326,0.0002857142857143058,0.0002857142857143058,0.0002857142857143058,0.0002857142857143058,0.0002857142857143058,0.014571428571427403,0.0002857142857143058,0.0002857142857143058,0.10106619840606748,0.0002857142857143058,0.0002857142857143058,0.0002857142857143058,0.0002857142857143058,0.0002857142857143058,0.0436719285637975,0.03147110889607016,0.0002857142857143058,0.04544614457962736,0.0002857142857143058,0.17187018827130016,0.0002857142857143058,0.0002857142857143058,0.0002857142857143058,0.0002857142857143058,0.0002857142857143058,0.0002857142857143058,0.0002857142857143058,0.0002857142857143058,0.0002857142857143058,0.06624576934997699,0.0002857142857143058,0.0002857142857143058,0.0002857142857143058,0.015557274778446456,0.0002857142857143058,0.0002857142857143058,0.2351476007567095,0.05198927309002803,0.0002857142857143058,0.0002857142857143058,0.0002857142857143058,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0

53618,2,Never leave home without it . I purchased my first Roadmate in August 2004 . Since then I have taken it to various places in North America . It 's gotten me out of some tight spaces . I 've never gotten lost while using it . I purchased the second one when the voice interface on the first failed . I sent it in for repair . ( The extended warranty had just run out about 2 weeks earlier ) The new RoadMate arrived in two days and has worked fine ever since . The old Roadmate was returned to me repaired in about a week . I gave the first one to my wife and she has used it with success ever since . Pros : Easy to use . Amazing detail . Cons : Sometimes takes a long time to acquire satellites Original mount is useless after about a month . I got aftermarket tripod for each unit and they seem to work fine . Software updates are expensive .,173,1,0.0005882352941177046,0.0005882352941177046,0.03055712936241116,0.030378339322215498,0.0005882352941177046,0.0005882352941177046,0.03000030447896881,0.0005882352941177046,0.02319973402786283,0.0005882352941177046,0.0005882352941177046,0.0005882352941177046,0.0005882352941177046,0.0005882352941177046,0.0005882352941177046,0.0005882352941177046,0.0005882352941177046,0.0005882352941177046,0.0005882352941177046,0.0005882352941177046,0.0005882352941177046,0.0005882352941177046,0.2064498017910947,0.02794519742252098,0.0005882352941177046,0.0005882352941177046,0.0005882352941177046,0.0005882352941177046,0.0005882352941177046,0.0005882352941177046,0.0005882352941177046,0.0005882352941177046,0.0005882352941177046,0.0005882352941177046,0.0005882352941177046,0.0005882352941177046,0.0005882352941177046,0.0005882352941177046,0.14462302272615687,0.0005882352941177046,0.19953781602282253,0.0005882352941177046,0.08466370744963662,0.0005882352941177046,0.0005882352941177046,0.0005882352941177046,0.19911553563160167,0.0005882352941177046,0.0005882352941177046,0.0005882352941177046,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

53630,2,HP 50 G Review Comments The 50 G is the successor to the HP 49G. They both accept only a maximum of 1 GB SecureDigital flash cards since they only have an approximate 1 GB operating system file address space . Only about 0.9 GB of the SecureDigital flash cards ( a little more on the HP 49 G than on the HP 50 G ) are accessible . The manuals only vaguely state that they recognice FAT16 and FAT32 SecureDigital flash cards . The HP 50 G has a black case with a black metallic faceplate . The white and orange shift key labels on the metallic black faceplate have much better contrast and are easier to distinguish than the HP 49 G red ( or tomato ) and turquiose shift key labels on the tan anodized faceplate . The black HP 50 G looks tastefully geared for serious users . They still have no display backlighting or a color display . The HP 50 G keyboard feels a little more compliant than the HP 49 G but it would be nicer if they were as buttery smooth as the original early 1970 's series of the HP hand held calculators,202,1,0.0008333333333333775,0.0008333333333333775,0.0008333333333333775,0.0008333333333333775,0.1164214603834082,0.0008333333333333775,0.0008333333333333775,0.0008333333333333775,0.04442033205975403,0.0008333333333333775,0.0008333333333333775,0.0008333333333333775,0.0008333333333333775,0.0008333333333333775,0.0008333333333333775,0.0008333333333333775,0.04323648011173029,0.0008333333333333775,0.0008333333333333775,0.0008333333333333775,0.0008333333333333775,0.0008333333333333775,0.0008333333333333775,0.10083957476390537,0.0008333333333333775,0.0008333333333333775,0.0008333333333333775,0.0008333333333333775,0.0008333333333333775,0.2956182919750021,0.0008333333333333775,0.0008333333333333775,0.0008333333333333775,0.0008333333333333775,0.0008333333333333775,0.24070239607754085,0.0008333333333333775,0.0008333333333333775,0.0008333333333333775,0.0008333333333333775,0.0008333333333333775,0.0008333333333333775,0.0008333333333333775,0.0008333333333333775,0.07573321723459296,0.04802824739406453,0.0008333333333333775,0.0008333333333333775,0.0008333333333333775,0.0008333333333333775,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0
53641,2,"Amazing clarity and bass Soundwise the Klipsch Promedia Ultra 5.1s were everything that they were supposed to be . The bass is very powerful and can even be overpowering if not adjusted . The sound is crystal clear and with a decent sound card all of the settings can be tweaked until perfection . Setup was a breeze and no instructions are needed although they are provided just in case . Something to note is the speaker wire that comes with the speakers is a little on the small size and thicker wires should be be purchased if you are picky about your sound . The wires themselves are long enough and there should n't be any trouble reaching anywhere assuming you are putting these in a normal sized room . One last thing to know is that there is no optical input for these speakers and only 1/8 "" plugs for hooking up the sound source . If you want optical you 're going to have to go elsewhere . Please note that buying these speakers will not make up for having a mediocre sound card or poor music quality . If you are using most types of on board sound or an ancient soundblaster card it is time to upgrade or else you are just throwing away your money . Same goes for music quality , if you are listening to an mp3 that is below 128kbps the poor sound quality is because of the shoddy encoding , not the speakers . If you ca n't spare the hard drive space for 192kbps its time to get a new hard drive . Overall these speakers are a great deal . While the price tag does seem a bit steep it is well worth the money for anyone that is serious about their music or movies . For those of you who like to game these speakers will treat you good , however in my past experience a good set of headphones is better than a full blown sound system . Lastly for those of you who like to play your music and bass full blast , do n't bother spending the money . These speakers should only be purchased by people who actually care about sound quality . If you are more worried about loudness , do yourself a favor and buy some cheaper speakers , you wo n't even notice the difference",405,1,0.1255597555454991,0.09501692451754695,0.08380704552589589,0.00021505376344088027,0.06167685094202166,0.00021505376344088027,0.011175501700540411,0.00021505376344088027,0.00021505376344088027,0.00021505376344088027,0.14154437755628813,0.00021505376344088027,0.00021505376344088027,0.00021505376344088027,0.011847116616316098,0.00021505376344088027,0.00021505376344088027,0.01953747786506291,0.00021505376344088027,0.00021505376344088027,0.018344051949352534,0.00021505376344088027,0.00021505376344088027,0.00021505376344088027,0.00021505376344088027,0.00021505376344088027,0.00021505376344088027,0.00021505376344088027,0.17351262372035792,0.00021505376344088027,0.00021505376344088027,0.00021505376344088027,0.00021505376344088027,0.00021505376344088027,0.00021505376344088027,0.00021505376344088027,0.00021505376344088027,0.00021505376344088027,0.00021505376344088027,0.12691316717707327,0.00021505376344088027,0.021734176857141466,0.00021505376344088027,0.00021505376344088027,0.00021505376344088027,0.00021505376344088027,0.10137394077959128,0.00021505376344088027,0.00021505376344088027,0.00021505376344088027,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

The only problem I have encountered with any digital camera is that when you think you have enough memory , you run out when you need it most . That is why I upgraded all of my cameras from 256 and 512 meg memory sticks to the Sony 1 gig . Actually I carry a spare 1 gig too where ever I go . Look , when you take video with your digital camera or you use a high file size ( 3 - 6 megapixels ) per picture , which you should always do to get the best possible prints made , your camera will need a ton of storage space . Especially if you are on vacation or encounter a great photo moment or maybe even something you had n't expected like a wildfire , a plane crash , a bank robbery or maybe even a cat in the park having kittens . You can always "" resize "" you photos to a smaller size later when you save then to your computer if you want to save space . Trust me , take large megapixel pics now and you will be amazed at how many shots came out better that you expected . You never know . I have tons of pictures that people ask how did I ever get such good pictures of such amazing things . I have a helicopter crash , police car up a power poll , deer in downtown Oakland , house fire before the Fire Dept got there , tons of wild animals , any many more things I saw while I was driving somewhere or walking in a park . If you want great photos you have to be prepared when the moment arrives!Matching a camera with its name brand memory is also a great idea . No problems ever ! ! The Sony memory sticks I have from 5 to 6 years ago still work great with no problems . They make it fast and easy to transfer data from your camera to your computer . They are tiny wafer thin and extremely light weight and durable . I have first hand knowledge that products with the SONY name on it are first rate and high quality . If you want quality buy SONY",420,1,0.0002564102564102793,0.07897975772433523,0.08387150921886169,0.0002564102564102793,0.1003862933118507,0.0002564102564102793,0.03911461620357655,0.0002564102564102793,0.0002564102564102793,0.0002564102564102793,0.0002564102564102793,0.0002564102564102793,0.1135561189304449,0.0002564102564102793,0.0002564102564102793,0.0002564102564102793,0.0002564102564102793,0.017345330838355804,0.0002564102564102793,0.038891984296934405,0.0002564102564102793,0.0002564102564102793,0.11959427198557668,0.0002564102564102793,0.0002564102564102793,0.0002564102564102793,0.0002564102564102793,0.0002564102564102793,0.016968973649157972,0.046689071774455825,0.0002564102564102793,0.0002564102564102793,0.0002564102564102793,0.0002564102564102793,0.0002564102564102793,0.0002564102564102793,0.0002564102564102793,0.0002564102564102793,0.0002564102564102793,0.12313771019060071,0.05906620552496148,0.01308089261638059,0.04697138499857698,0.0002564102564102793,0.0002564102564102793,0.09337151976157082,0.0002564102564102793,0.0002564102564102793,0.0002564102564102793,0.0002564102564102793,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

53674,2,"Wicked Good Back Pack A sore back and a sore shoulder forced me to search for a better means to carry my laptop . I took a month to research laptop backpacks and finally settled on the Kensington Contour . I did n't want to buy a Kensington . I wanted a backpack making company with a name I knew , like Jansport , or Kelty . I 've been a backpacker and was familiar with their products . I settled on the Kensington because it had the qualities I was seeking : comfort , quality materials and design , water proofing , laptop padding , urban black , rugged exterior , sophisticated appearance , lots of pockets , adjustable lumbar support with back padding and a water bottle pocket . I write and work in media for a living . Mostly I work at home , but once a week I travel to cities . This pack does exactly what I want it to do - have places for everything I need , protect my precious laptop , and look hip . So now it is a few months later . I still like my pack , but twice now the hardware has broken . The first time it was just the zipper - handle on the little outside pocket . It fell off . Kennisington immediately replaced the pack for free . Last week at the airport the tab that holds and adjusts the left shoulder strap-- broke when slung the pack across my back . I have n't contacted them yet",264,1,0.22297714974771773,0.0004878048780488149,0.029306877645684255,0.05682992861818487,0.0004878048780488149,0.028316690065184027,0.0004878048780488149,0.0004878048780488149,0.02614050264505671,0.0004878048780488149,0.0004878048780488149,0.0004878048780488149,0.0004878048780488149,0.0004878048780488149,0.0004878048780488149,0.0004878048780488149,0.08707315267481072,0.03292171473555806,0.0004878048780488149,0.0004878048780488149,0.0004878048780488149,0.0004878048780488149,0.06757633269456112,0.0004878048780488149,0.0259207012143735,0.0004878048780488149,0.028948744995714582,0.0004878048780488149,0.0004878048780488149,0.0004878048780488149,0.0004878048780488149,0.0004878048780488149,0.0004878048780488149,0.0004878048780488149,0.0004878048780488149,0.02558097467395913,0.0004878048780488149,0.0004878048780488149,0.06662633877008756,0.0004878048780488149,0.0004878048780488149,0.0004878048780488149,0.07399945679153923,0.0004878048780488149,0.14772334690577538,0.0629849170900846,0.0004878048780488149,0.0004878048780488149,0.0004878048780488149,0.0004878048780488149,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0

53715,2,My first review of a product ! These speakers were purchased for office use and occasionally for on the road . They are a great look and compact . The sound is decent and should not be confused with higher end speakers . They serve the purpose for which they were intended as far as I am concerned as I purchased them to play my NANO I - pod . I do recommend them .,75,1,0.0012500000000000612,0.0012500000000000612,0.0012500000000000612,0.0012500000000000612,0.056749124353777616,0.0012500000000000612,0.0012500000000000612,0.0012500000000000612,0.06655206474211532,0.0012500000000000612,0.46207877213837806,0.08508878778283742,0.0012500000000000612,0.0012500000000000612,0.0012500000000000612,0.0012500000000000612,0.0012500000000000612,0.0012500000000000612,0.0012500000000000612,0.0012500000000000612,0.0012500000000000612,0.0012500000000000612,0.0012500000000000612,0.0012500000000000612,0.0012500000000000612,0.0012500000000000612,0.0012500000000000612,0.0012500000000000612,0.06375000000000187,0.0012500000000000612,0.0012500000000000612,0.0012500000000000612,0.13013346129085873,0.0012500000000000612,0.0012500000000000612,0.0012500000000000612,0.0012500000000000612,0.0012500000000000612,0.0012500000000000612,0.0012500000000000612,0.0012500000000000612,0.0012500000000000612,0.0012500000000000612,0.0012500000000000612,0.08189778969202852,0.0012500000000000612,0.0012500000000000612,0.0012500000000000612,0.0012500000000000612,0.0012500000000000612,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1

53734,2,"Cheap and clever When we needed speaker systems for a batch of new workstations , price was the main consideration . The price for these units was well below budget . Since our main application for them was for audio - enhanced CAT ( Computer Assisted Training ) , High fidelity and volume were not issues . They worked admirably for the purpose . The use of a USB port for the power supply was a clever twist . One of my aggravating support woes is keeping speaker power adapters matched up with corresponding speakers . I had been buying unpowered ( unamplified ) units with no manual volume control .

53737,2,"Jabra BT150 Review I bought this headset and I must say it 's a great buy . First off it 's lightweight weighing in at about 16 grams . It 's small which definately helps when your wearing it around . At times it 's like you do n't even feel liek your wearing anything . Exactly how a headset should be . I 've place and recieved many calls with it already and having been using the the traditional wired headsets of the past this headset sound better and has no wires . The only problem I have found so far is that it takes some time getting used to the button placement and answering calls with the headset . Not to mention you only hear the standard ringtone rather than your custom ringtones . But that a small price to pay for such a great , inexpensive headset like this one",153,1,0.0006666666666666999,0.0006666666666666999,0.0006666666666666999,0.0006666666666666999,0.07250384291194428,0.0006666666666666999,0.0006666666666666999,0.0006666666666666999,0.0006666666666666999,0.0006666666666666999,0.0006666666666666999,0.0006666666666666999,0.0006666666666666999,0.0006666666666666999,0.0006666666666666999,0.0006666666666666999,0.0694259915171166,0.1431116285927353,0.0006666666666666999,0.0006666666666666999,0.0006666666666666999,0.0006666666666666999,0.04125662783040376,0.0006666666666666999,0.07354967220388041,0.0006666666666666999,0.0006666666666666999,0.0006666666666666999,0.04909701900664784,0.0006666666666666999,0.0006666666666666999,0.0006666666666666999,0.2753120058355202,0.0006666666666666999,0.0006666666666666999,0.0006666666666666999,0.0006666666666666999,0.0006666666666666999,0.0006666666666666999,0.0006666666666666999,0.19230688084194053,0.0006666666666666999,0.0006666666666666999,0.0006666666666666999,0.05610299792647641,0.0006666666666666999,0.0006666666666666999,0.0006666666666666999,0.0006666666666666999,0.0006666666666666999,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0
53741,2,"Great surge protector , especially for transformers I really likethe design on this Protector , and bought 3.It allows you to plug multiple transformers in , and still have room for regular plugs . Slipping plus in is a firm push , but not that tough . I also like the fact that it gives you a warning light if you get up around 12 amps .. Cool , but you have to keep in mind a 15 amp circuit shoulldn't have 12 amps to one plug .. The cord restraint system slides out to hold all the cords , then wedges backin to hold them in place .

53784,2,"Surprised what a difference this makes . Much more pleasant working on laptop . I bought this laptop stand when I found out that my laptop could drive dual screens so I could have different items on the two screens and drag stuff between them . So now I have the center of the screens at the same height , side - by - side . It is really nice to have twice the screen real - estate . I figured that mostly I would put background stuff on the laptop screen ( like email ) and use my big hi - resolution screen for what I was activly working on . But , now that the laptop screen is up at eye level , I tend to use it just as often as the big monitor ! It turns out that my dislike of the laptop screen had more to do with having to look down at it , even though I was not aware of that until I got it raised .",174,1,0.0006896551724138559,0.08735287686158157,0.0006896551724138559,0.0006896551724138559,0.0006896551724138559,0.0006896551724138559,0.0006896551724138559,0.0006896551724138559,0.2509608205577569,0.0006896551724138559,0.0006896551724138559,0.0006896551724138559,0.0006896551724138559,0.0006896551724138559,0.0006896551724138559,0.0006896551724138559,0.0006896551724138559,0.059837529867245796,0.0006896551724138559,0.0006896551724138559,0.0006896551724138559,0.0006896551724138559,0.0006896551724138559,0.0006896551724138559,0.0006896551724138559,0.0006896551724138559,0.0006896551724138559,0.0006896551724138559,0.0006896551724138559,0.17571169283925228,0.0006896551724138559,0.0006896551724138559,0.0006896551724138559,0.0006896551724138559,0.0006896551724138559,0.0006896551724138559,0.0006896551724138559,0.0006896551724138559,0.0006896551724138559,0.0006896551724138559,0.0006896551724138559,0.06861743687110404,0.0006896551724138559,0.0006896551724138559,0.17091057713917435,0.0006896551724138559,0.1569538934500893,0.0006896551724138559,0.0006896551724138559,0.0006896551724138559,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0

53797,2,"Flawed , but still the best case for the iPod 20 GB I researched cases upon receipt of my 20 GB iPod and deemed this the best . This case consists of a thin plastic sleeve inside a separate clear , hard shell . The hard case protects the iPod from scratches and minor falls while still allowing easy access to the controls and inputs . It also does not obscure the screen . An enclosed plastic belt clip attaches to the back of the unit . This case is not compatible with a Bose Sounddock as the user must remove the iPod from the case . Also , Contour Design only enclosed one of the thin plastic sleeves . I spent $ 5 at their website for 5 more sleeves and gave some to friends with the same case .

53799,2,"Works for me I 've had this controller for over a year now , and it still works great and reliably as ever . After many months , the analog sticks occasionally drifted a little , but a quick jiggle and they 'd be back to center . The profiler software is excellent , allowing you to fully map the controller to your keyboard and even mouse . This allows you to play any game with the controller , even ones which do n't naturally support gamepads like Splinter Cell . With the "" shift "" profile function , you can effectively double the number of buttons which I found great for playing a complicated flight sim like X - Wing Alliance , completely keyboard free , using only the gamepad . Only downside : The D - pad is hard to control precisely . It 's difficult to press only Up , Down , Left or Right . You almost always end up pressing a diagonal direction instead . This made the D - pad more or less unusable for games like Street Fighter , but then the analog stick was a perfect alternative anyway",196,1,0.16002281549497732,0.0006060606060606508,0.0006060606060606508,0.0006060606060606508,0.09717155214773196,0.0006060606060606508,0.0006060606060606508,0.0006060606060606508,0.08595862510603801,0.0006060606060606508,0.0006060606060606508,0.0006060606060606508,0.0006060606060606508,0.0006060606060606508,0.0006060606060606508,0.0006060606060606508,0.0006060606060606508,0.0006060606060606508,0.0006060606060606508,0.0006060606060606508,0.0006060606060606508,0.0006060606060606508,0.1247239192028466,0.037714092233181326,0.03152244010077811,0.0006060606060606508,0.0006060606060606508,0.0006060606060606508,0.03885324457970013,0.09676467560388262,0.0006060606060606508,0.0006060606060606508,0.0006060606060606508,0.0006060606060606508,0.0006060606060606508,0.0006060606060606508,0.0006060606060606508,0.0006060606060606508,0.0006060606060606508,0.0006060606060606508,0.0006060606060606508,0.0006060606060606508,0.03110889818345114,0.0006060606060606508,0.08856988989021695,0.0006060606060606508,0.1839534838208304,0.0006060606060606508,0.0006060606060606508,0.0006060606060606508,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0

A nice improvement would be a retractable cord facility so that you do n't have excess cordage lying around your dashboard . Right now I loop the excess around the steering wheel but then again I never change the adjustment on the steering wheel so no problem with the wire getting caught up in the adjusting mechanism . Others may run into this problem . The alternative is a shorter wire but then it would make the power unit useless for some vehicles . A minor hitch but not earthshaking .,157,1,0.0010000000000000681,0.1842009230745268,0.0010000000000000681,0.0010000000000000681,0.0010000000000000681,0.0010000000000000681,0.0010000000000000681,0.0010000000000000681,0.0010000000000000681,0.0010000000000000681,0.0010000000000000681,0.0010000000000000681,0.0010000000000000681,0.0010000000000000681,0.0010000000000000681,0.0010000000000000681,0.0010000000000000681,0.0010000000000000681,0.0010000000000000681,0.14038424976168176,0.0010000000000000681,0.0010000000000000681,0.20100000000001053,0.0010000000000000681,0.0010000000000000681,0.10136491455447798,0.0010000000000000681,0.0010000000000000681,0.0010000000000000681,0.0010000000000000681,0.0010000000000000681,0.0010000000000000681,0.0010000000000000681,0.0010000000000000681,0.050997973353168885,0.0010000000000000681,0.0010000000000000681,0.0010000000000000681,0.0010000000000000681,0.0010000000000000681,0.0010000000000000681,0.10100000000000532,0.17805193925612584,0.0010000000000000681,0.0010000000000000681,0.0010000000000000681,0.0010000000000000681,0.0010000000000000681,0.0010000000000000681,0.0010000000000000681,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1
53805,2,"Happy so far After reading the online reviews of this product vs. the portable product I went with this one . Portability is not much of a need , I plan on being around a power outlet . The sound is in line with a radio / boom box of the same size and it 's about the same weight . I have a lot of trees around my house so I have to extend the antenna several feet out the back door in order to get a good signal . Keep that in mind if you have signal issues with your satellite unit . I have my unit placed next to the back door in the kitchen and I can hear it all over the first floor of my home . So far I 'm happy that I bought it",141,1,0.06654000206485677,0.05915417715974457,0.0007142857142857694,0.0007142857142857694,0.0007142857142857694,0.0007142857142857694,0.0007142857142857694,0.0007142857142857694,0.03001365288452915,0.0007142857142857694,0.0920465308893662,0.0007142857142857694,0.0007142857142857694,0.0007142857142857694,0.0007142857142857694,0.0007142857142857694,0.0007142857142857694,0.07287322526726109,0.0007142857142857694,0.08976897840719597,0.0007142857142857694,0.0007142857142857694,0.12943704933445122,0.0007142857142857694,0.07659656118299377,0.0007142857142857694,0.11392288740537661,0.0007142857142857694,0.038612579782914734,0.0007142857142857694,0.0007142857142857694,0.0007142857142857694,0.16717301134396403,0.0007142857142857694,0.0007142857142857694,0.0007142857142857694,0.0007142857142857694,0.0007142857142857694,0.0007142857142857694,0.0007142857142857694,0.0007142857142857694,0.036718487134486694,0.0007142857142857694,0.0007142857142857694,0.0007142857142857694,0.0007142857142857694,0.0007142857142857694,0.0007142857142857694,0.0007142857142857694,0.0007142857142857694,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

53836,2,"Sony DVD Player Operation of the Sony DVPNSS550 / B single disc DVD player has been straight forward . Picture quality is very good , and the desired basic features have functioned without problems . In other words , in the 2 1/2 months since we have owned this player , quality and reliability have been high . Price too was very reasonable . That means durability is the last quality to consider , which is why I have given the player a 4 rather than a 5 . There is no reason a machine like this should not be problem free for years . But we wo n't know that for years .",114,1,0.0006666666666667366,0.0006666666666667366,0.14849000365794285,0.0006666666666667366,0.03907211467678638,0.0006666666666667366,0.0006666666666667366,0.0006666666666667366,0.0006666666666667366,0.0006666666666667366,0.0006666666666667366,0.0006666666666667366,0.0006666666666667366,0.0006666666666667366,0.0006666666666667366,0.0006666666666667366,0.0006666666666667366,0.10958108068770045,0.0006666666666667366,0.0006666666666667366,0.0006666666666667366,0.0006666666666667366,0.0353173715225859,0.0006666666666667366,0.03580802052255394,0.0006666666666667366,0.0006666666666667366,0.0006666666666667366,0.0006666666666667366,0.03991461468182421,0.0006666666666667366,0.0006666666666667366,0.07794358296965244,0.0006666666666667366,0.0006666666666667366,0.0006666666666667366,0.0006666666666667366,0.0006666666666667366,0.0006666666666667366,0.24897993104505187,0.1313721939434071,0.0006666666666667366,0.05905370664284494,0.0006666666666667366,0.04846737964964717,0.0006666666666667366,0.0006666666666667366,0.0006666666666667366,0.0006666666666667366,0.0006666666666667366,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0
53839,2,"Wow ! As long as I own a pair of these headphones , I will never use bass boost or a graphic equalizer again . They sound PERFECT . I can not fathom a more balanced , natural sound . These babies put you in the recording studio , or in the concert hall ! Bass is crisp , taut , and strong . You can feel it . Yet it is not overbearing or boomy . Midrange is balanced so well that you 'd swear you were standing next to the lead guitarist , and the treble is so crisp and clear that you will rediscover the percussion sections of your favorite tunes . The folding feature is handy . The only things to be aware of are the following : First , you have to break them in . They start sounding better after a few hours of use . Second , they do n't have an inline volume control , which I will dearly miss from my Koss KTXpro1s . Finally , plenty of sound escapes . So do n't crank them too much in the library or at Grandma Edith 's funeral . Other than that , you have no excuse . Put your iPod 's lousy white earbuds in the garbage disposal where they belong , and order these ( or if you do n't want to fork out $ 40 , order the Koss KTX Pro titanium phones - which are almost as good as these , and definitely the best in the sub-$20 price range . )",264,1,0.0006451612903226386,0.0006451612903226386,0.0006451612903226386,0.038241498261832145,0.0006451612903226386,0.0006451612903226386,0.0006451612903226386,0.0006451612903226386,0.12090687886874378,0.0006451612903226386,0.0006451612903226386,0.0006451612903226386,0.0006451612903226386,0.0006451612903226386,0.0006451612903226386,0.0006451612903226386,0.07137122258369599,0.0006451612903226386,0.032903225806452746,0.11099856780879551,0.0006451612903226386,0.0006451612903226386,0.0006451612903226386,0.07144100366925733,0.0006451612903226386,0.0006451612903226386,0.0006451612903226386,0.0006451612903226386,0.23247079100413665,0.0006451612903226386,0.0006451612903226386,0.0006451612903226386,0.0006451612903226386,0.0006451612903226386,0.0006451612903226386,0.034786916249275567,0.0006451612903226386,0.0006451612903226386,0.03833188432895454,0.0006451612903226386,0.05304155084500655,0.0329367424818487,0.0006451612903226386,0.0006451612903226386,0.0006451612903226386,0.08219223482931821,0.05650651552074476,0.0006451612903226386,0.0006451612903226386,0.0006451612903226386,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0

53881,2,"Good Sound Quality , but ... I bought these Ear Headphones primarily to use when running and biking at the club . The sound quality is acceptable , not exceptional . The construction is a little flimsy and the big issue is that the cord is shorter for the left ear than the right . That places all the force on the left side and that one tends to pull out . I have no idea why Sony thought that this was a good design . For the money they could also have included a case rather than a clip for the cord .

53906,2,"Mine works great I got mine to work in about 30 min following S Huffs directions below ( followed exactly ) . There was only one thing not mentioned that I had to do to get it to work . Once you get into the settings on the range extender to enable WEP and put in the key and passphrase , I had to turn WEP back on on my router before saving the settings on the range extender . Basically just put step 6 before you save settings in step 5 , this is what worked for me at any rate . I've had it for about 4 months now and it has worked as advertised . I gave it 4 stars because set up was still kind of a pain . From S Huff : The tips that Anthony Taylor left helped me get it working ... but I still had some issues . I 've added onto his tips from his review below 1-Disable WEP on your Router or AP 2-Hold the auto - configuration button for 30 seconds(if everything goes well both lights on the expander will turn blue ) and unplug while still holding button . Plug back in after 10 - 15 secs . 3-open your Internet explorer browser and type 192.168.1.240 ( default ip of expander ) , a window will pop up . leave the user name blank and put admin as a password ( this is default password ) . 4-make sure that the default gateway and subnet mask settings are identical with your Router or AP , change password on the expander if desired and save settings . ( all settings should be correct due to auto configuration ) 5-Enable WEP on the expander , once again remember use same settings that you will be putting in your router or AP in step 6 -- aka same passphrase ) , save settings again . 5.5 - As soon as you enable WEP on your expander - you will loose your connection to it as it 's now setup for WEP and your router is n't - keep this in mind - drove me nuts . 6-Go to your Router or Ap settings and enable WEP . 7 - UNPLUG your expander for 10 to 15 seconds and plug it back in -- Bang you 're DONE .

53932,2,"HP Photosmart 335 Printer This printer was purchased for my wife 's birthday and arrivedin two to three days . Considering money spent the printerworks quite well . Pictures come out very good overall . AnHP 95 or HP 97 cartridge is used for color photos . It containsthree color inks but no black . Still , photos will easily satisfy the average owner . An HP 100 cartridge can be usedfor black and white photos . Yes , the color cartridge must beexchanged for the black one when converting from color toblack and white and vise versa . Even so , we find the printerfun and very simple to use . Just keep in mind that the priceof ink will soon exceed the price of the printer if usedoften . What we do is use it for special occasions or whenthe grandchildren come over .

53949,2,"Great features My favorite thing about this phone is that the caller ID captures 11 digit numbers ( 1-xxx - xxx - xxxx ) which are then very easy to store into the phone book and call . My old phone only captured 10 digits ( xxx - xxx - xxxx ) which meant I had to reenter everything manually because of course you have to dial a 1 first . This new phone also allows me to toggle between 11 digits and 7 digits on the same number . I put together my phone book just by capturing calls as they came in . Very handy . As far as being a phone , it does everything well and after a couple of months I am still as happy as could be with it",135,1,0.0007407407407407835,0.0007407407407407835,0.0007407407407407835,0.03868949186027286,0.04162958037599231,0.0007407407407407835,0.0007407407407407835,0.0007407407407407835,0.0007407407407407835,0.0007407407407407835,0.0007407407407407835,0.0007407407407407835,0.0007407407407407835,0.0007407407407407835,0.0007407407407407835,0.0007407407407407835,0.0007407407407407835,0.0007407407407407835,0.0007407407407407835,0.0007407407407407835,0.0007407407407407835,0.0007407407407407835,0.0007407407407407835,0.08572595884722363,0.037821376543842884,0.0007407407407407835,0.30902599295929833,0.0007407407407407835,0.0007407407407407835,0.0007407407407407835,0.0007407407407407835,0.0007407407407407835,0.08665895164608216,0.0007407407407407835,0.0007407407407407835,0.0007407407407407835,0.08049420995937726,0.0007407407407407835,0.0007407407407407835,0.11638576612619014,0.0007407407407407835,0.0007407407407407835,0.04020179055306773,0.0007407407407407835,0.0007407407407407835,0.1337372514990214,0.0007407407407407835,0.0007407407407407835,0.0007407407407407835,0.0007407407407407835,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
53955,2,"Best traveling mouse yet I 've never written a review , but I 've relied heavily upon the voluntary opinions of other Amazon buyers , so I felt a really good product like the Anycom Bluetooth mouse deserves an unsolicited review . I know experience and taste vary by individual , but this mouse is awesome from my viewpoint . Pros:- Bluetooth - connects immediately ; provides smooth accurate tracking- Size - very portable ; some may find it too narrow ; I have a hardtime going back to a wider mouse- Battery life - I get at least 2 days out of it before charing and I 'm a fairly heavy user- USB charge attachment - allows you to continue to work while recharging- Product Design / Quality - Nicely engineered ; good quality material- not tinny - it 's built to take abuseCons:- Have n't really found any - It took me awhile to figure out how to connect until I read the manual line by line ( I do n't tend to do that ) then I realized it was pretty straight forward .

53957,2,"like an electronic glove ... I 'm a skeptic . No , I mean I 'm REALLY a skeptic ... especially in today 's marketplace ( because nothing is built like it used to be ) . I do n't buy anything without checking it out first , and even then , I expect that it 's probably going to fail me when I do . Yeah , wonderful view there , huh?Well , needless to say , I was pleasantly ( and quite happily ) surprised when this device did n't fail me out of the box . I 've been using my speedpad for almost a year now , and I have to say that it has been by far more solid , responsive and intuitive than I ever expected it to be . I will not play a PC game without it plugged in now , that 's how well this gamepad has worked for me . Here are the ins and outs:1 ) Solid construction . As others have stated , this device feels very solid and is just generally "" sturdy as hell "" . This , alone , surprised me . Not too many electronic devices are solidly made these days ( not too many at all ! ) ... so I 'm glad to see that this one was . Belkin did an excellent job in this department.2 ) Software . Do yourself a favor , when you get this device home , do n't bother putting in the CD that comes with it . Instead , go directly to Belkin 's website first - thing , download the newer version of the software ( which is near exactly the same as what 's on the CD , but updated ) and install that * before * plugging in your speedpad for the first time . Do that and you 'll have everything updated immediately with little to no trouble at all . I've had no problems with the software for this hardware ( and that 's generally the part I have trouble with the most ) . The applications ( profiler and button editor ) function perfectly , and macros are a snap to program . Kudos to Belkin 's programmers on writing the software suite for this , they did a good job.4 ) Sticky keys . Most people have experienced this .. myself included . Being possibly a byproduct of the solid construction of the product , basically , what happens is the keys stick just a little bit coming out of the box . Though just "" excercising "" the device ( pressing the buttons down quickly and solidly over and over ) for a few seconds after plugging it in each time I went to use it cleared up this issue within the first week of using the gamepad , and I 've never had it happen since . 5 ) Other buttons . * The mouse scroll wheel can be an annoyance , and I do n't use it much at all because it 's hard to scroll up and down with it ( Belkin may just have made that particular button a little * too * solid ) . * The orange button above the d - pad also is n't that easy to press , though if you keep you pinky finger positioned on the side of the keypad for leverage , it 's not impossible to press this button ( in fact , I use it as my default "" map "" button in most of the games I play ) . It 's perfect for those functions you use enough to need a button for but not enough to need an easy spam button . * I have n't experienced any problems hitting the ' space ' button below the d - pad that others have experienced . My thumb taps that button as easily as it taps the space bar on a standard keyboard . My only complaint with it is that I ca n't simply twist my thumb a bit to hit the key , I have to actually lift my thumb off the d - pad to do it - and that 's not much of a complaint at all , really . The d - pad itself is a godsend ! I 'm a true console gamer , having used nothing but d - pads for movement since all the time spent playing my old NES as a kid ( and using a joystick before that with my even older Atari ) . D - pad is all I know , really . In fact , the one thing that 's kept me away from PC gaming all these years is I 've never , ever been able to accustom myself to using arrow keys or WASD for movement ( and probably never will get accustomed to that either ) . For the longest time I was looking for a device that could allow me to keep the sensitivity of mouse aiming ( to keep up with other PC players ) while giving me an actual d - pad for movement ... and that is EXACTLY what this gamepad did for me . As I said at the top of this review , I will never play a PC game without my Nostromo speedpad plugged in . This gamepad has provided the one benefit that other pads have n't and that I really needed - a controller interface that 's actually functional and intuitive enough to use that I forget I 'm using it most of the time , allowing me to immerse myself completely in whatever game I 'm playing ... which is really the point of gaming in the first place , is n't it ? The Nostromo Speedpad gets 5 stars from me . I would recommend it to anyone who 's looking for the type of benefits I 've listed . And , for that matter , I 'm recommending it right now in fact ...",1021,1,0.00013986013986015276,0.07667318351561454,0.00013986013986015276,0.012109843626577549,0.02596622738678657,0.00013986013986015276,0.00013986013986015276,0.00013986013986015276,0.03574817621881036,0.00013986013986015276,0.004766216482028944,0.013805899845756982,0.22795023810984383,0.00013986013986015276,0.00013986013986015276,0.00013986013986015276,0.020629274973426114,0.01068134422740757,0.00013986013986015276,0.00013986013986015276,0.00013986013986015276,0.00013986013986015276,0.05867233655278577,0.00013986013986015276,0.00013986013986015276,0.00013986013986015276,0.02349781696167025,0.00013986013986015276,0.00013986013986015276,0.00013986013986015276,0.00013986013986015276,0.00013986013986015276,0.031568725894508265,0.00013986013986015276,0.00013986013986015276,0.00013986013986015276,0.00013986013986015276,0.00013986013986015276,0.09262659380342977,0.00013986013986015276,0.009694937360699733,0.00013986013986015276,0.00013986013986015276,0.00013986013986015276,0.1541487547197424,0.00013986013986015276,0.19670518556566594,0.00013986013986015276,0.00013986013986015276,0.00013986013986015276,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0

53970,2,"better than most Since there are very few cases that fit iPAQ PDAs , I recommend you get this one . Depending on type of your iPAQ ( 1900 series vs 3000 series ) , you might have varying degrees of comfort trying to shove your PDA into the case . Once you 're done , however , it 's very easy to use and carry . It comes with a belt clip that you may or may not use . The case itself is slim enough to fit snugly in your pocket , unlike so many other cases . The obvious disadvantage is that if you drop it on a hard surface , this case wo n't provide much in a way of side protection ( klutzes be warned ) . The leather feels surprisingly good , almost a lambskin kind of quality . The credit card space is not very useful , but you can shove a couple of business cards in there .

54021,3,"Too flimsy ! Light also not that bright . Being somewhat of an insomniac I read well into the hours of the night and a book light is essential to me . I therefore purchased the itty bitty booklight . If you do use this light it is essential to purchase the power supply for two reasons . Firstly , there is no auto shut - off so if you fall asleep reading your batteries wear down very quickly . Secondly , when using batteries , they start dimming rather quickly making it hard on the eyes and difficult to read resulting in the constant need for new batteries . This light is also extremely fragile . Over a couple of years I went through 7 of these ! I would not recommend this light - for the amount you spend on the never - ending purchasing of batteries or the expensive power supply , and the constant new purchases after it breaks , you might as well splurge and buy a decent book light . I now have the Tri Lite by Capstone Enterprises ( available at Barnes and Nobel - come on and get it in stock Amazon ! ) It is terrific ! It has a clock with an alarm and a timer . You can set it to stay on for any period of time and once it reaches that time the light flashes . At that time you can extend the minutes . If you do n't do so , for example you 're sleeping , it will automatically shut off . It also produces much more light and is much brighter than the Itty Bitty Book Light",283,0,0.00039215686274513163,0.15483103364464842,0.00039215686274513163,0.03950782063663293,0.00039215686274513163,0.00039215686274513163,0.00039215686274513163,0.00039215686274513163,0.2147321780045061,0.00039215686274513163,0.05202981511058979,0.00039215686274513163,0.00039215686274513163,0.00039215686274513163,0.00039215686274513163,0.00039215686274513163,0.00039215686274513163,0.07653667164381696,0.020000000000000746,0.00039215686274513163,0.00039215686274513163,0.00039215686274513163,0.00039215686274513163,0.00039215686274513163,0.00039215686274513163,0.026205028319014972,0.00039215686274513163,0.00039215686274513163,0.00039215686274513163,0.00039215686274513163,0.00039215686274513163,0.00039215686274513163,0.00039215686274513163,0.00039215686274513163,0.00039215686274513163,0.00039215686274513163,0.21466879471298136,0.00039215686274513163,0.00039215686274513163,0.00039215686274513163,0.09631643081677636,0.039743710989762746,0.00039215686274513163,0.00039215686274513163,0.00039215686274513163,0.00039215686274513163,0.05013439847420946,0.00039215686274513163,0.00039215686274513163,0.00039215686274513163,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

54063,3,"Worst Toaster Ever When our wonderful Cuisanart four - slice toaster finally died , we replaced it with this horrible piece of junk , because it seemed most similar to the old one . What a mistake!- Even on the lowest setting , this toaster burns the crust at the bottom.- It is not easy to tell if you have it set for two slices or four . With the old toaster , it was very easy to see.- The push - down slider does not move freely and sometimes has to be pushed down two or three times before it engages.- The old toaster let you select "" defrost "" and "" bagel "" at the same time . The new toaster lets you select one or the other . All in all , a big waste of money and a major disappointment .",145,0,0.0009090909090909618,0.1178075597122977,0.04636369559271618,0.04642651716806448,0.0009090909090909618,0.0009090909090909618,0.0009090909090909618,0.0009090909090909618,0.0009090909090909618,0.0009090909090909618,0.0009090909090909618,0.04636285442207736,0.2674056495714183,0.0009090909090909618,0.042663432564776976,0.0009090909090909618,0.0009090909090909618,0.0009090909090909618,0.0009090909090909618,0.0009090909090909618,0.0009090909090909618,0.0009090909090909618,0.0009090909090909618,0.1309608372263294,0.0009090909090909618,0.04611116216855234,0.0009090909090909618,0.0009090909090909618,0.0009090909090909618,0.0009090909090909618,0.0009090909090909618,0.0009090909090909618,0.0009090909090909618,0.0009090909090909618,0.0009090909090909618,0.0009090909090909618,0.0009090909090909618,0.0009090909090909618,0.0009090909090909618,0.2186255643010379,0.0009090909090909618,0.0009090909090909618,0.0009090909090909618,0.0009090909090909618,0.0009090909090909618,0.0009090909090909618,0.0009090909090909618,0.0009090909090909618,0.0009090909090909618,0.0009090909090909618,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1

I excitedly opened the box . First impression ... The unit was dirty , very heavily scatched and scuffed . Not exactly a good first impression . I then lifted the Roomba out of the box and I was immediately covered with dirt and dust . The bottom of the box was also filled with dirt and dust and hair . I flipped it over and discovered the brushes covered with dirt , dust and someones ( or somethings ! ) hair . I was grossed out , but even worse , the other person in the room ( who suffers from allergies ) started to sneeze violently . I spent the next 20 minutes thoroughly vacuuming the entire room and all other horizontal surfaces I could reach .

The best thing I can say for the Braun is that it does n't have the impossible - to - clean push buttons ( always look for a single switch , a knob , or a touch - pad ) .

( My smoothies were made of yogurt , O.J. , some frozen mango ... nothing extreme.)As far as the crepes go , even with only one "" tooth "" remaining , this baby still can stir eggs , milk , and a little flour ( thank you for small miracles ) . But ... the glass jug is a dribbler . When you pour batter or smoothies or whatever , some of the liquid will always ( I mean always ) dribble off the glass jug 's lip , down the front of the jug , down the front of the control panel , and also into the recessed area where those "" teeth "" meet each other . So ... you have to clean ALL the blender each time you use it ( i.e. , the jug , the control panel , the recessed area in which the jug sets ) not just clean the jug . What a pain in the neck . Once the last tooth breaks , this baby is going in the garbage .",257,0,0.000833333333333392,0.000833333333333392,0.000833333333333392,0.000833333333333392,0.000833333333333392,0.000833333333333392,0.000833333333333392,0.000833333333333392,0.000833333333333392,0.000833333333333392,0.000833333333333392,0.000833333333333392,0.000833333333333392,0.000833333333333392,0.000833333333333392,0.000833333333333392,0.047494964094221964,0.000833333333333392,0.000833333333333392,0.000833333333333392,0.000833333333333392,0.000833333333333392,0.000833333333333392,0.000833333333333392,0.06860114525327729,0.000833333333333392,0.04300656239697088,0.000833333333333392,0.08748851850643045,0.000833333333333392,0.000833333333333392,0.000833333333333392,0.050001524152585256,0.000833333333333392,0.000833333333333392,0.04256602667786655,0.000833333333333392,0.000833333333333392,0.000833333333333392,0.2727708516003716,0.000833333333333392,0.000833333333333392,0.000833333333333392,0.000833333333333392,0.21871326744303307,0.000833333333333392,0.13519047320857389,0.000833333333333392,0.000833333333333392,0.000833333333333392,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0
54086,3,"Looks Great , but ... Tired of exploring every possible way to ruin a pot of rice , I was looking forward to something that would do the job well and consistently . No such luck with this one ! First , it uses a different measuring system for the rice ( "" rice cooker cup"")than it does for the water ( "" regular measuring cup "" ) , so if you need more or less than the few amounts they list it 's back to guesswork again ! Worse though , is that the amount of water they call for is hugely more than is actually needed , so it boils very fast while pumping out all the excess water as steam . For those who might like to take a steam bath while they cook this would be great . One might figure out how to adjust the measuring , but there seems no way to slow the boiling down to lessen the steam output . Since water boils at the same temperature , fast or slow , it makes no sense . Yet another gripe is that it automatically goes into "" warm "" mode when it is finished . May be handy to have the warm option , but if you do n't realize it 's done and its left on "" warm "" for ten minutes the rice turns into a solid slab . It seems very well made , and handsome Bau - Haus design , but unfotrtunately I ca n't use it because of the above problems . Others ' experience may vary . Keep in mind I 'm very good at ruining rice . I just do n't need help doing it!David",290,0,0.39956235910366994,0.0004651162790697991,0.0004651162790697991,0.0004651162790697991,0.07877961913678709,0.0004651162790697991,0.0004651162790697991,0.0004651162790697991,0.047992987327438806,0.0004651162790697991,0.0004651162790697991,0.0004651162790697991,0.0004651162790697991,0.0004651162790697991,0.0004651162790697991,0.0004651162790697991,0.09693443703856092,0.0004651162790697991,0.023720930232558782,0.0815667571583365,0.0004651162790697991,0.0004651162790697991,0.0004651162790697991,0.0004651162790697991,0.0004651162790697991,0.0004651162790697991,0.0004651162790697991,0.0004651162790697991,0.0004651162790697991,0.0004651162790697991,0.0004651162790697991,0.024461693721505858,0.0004651162790697991,0.0004651162790697991,0.0004651162790697991,0.0004651162790697991,0.0004651162790697991,0.0004651162790697991,0.0004651162790697991,0.0004651162790697991,0.0004651162790697991,0.0004651162790697991,0.2274463325602104,0.0004651162790697991,0.0004651162790697991,0.0004651162790697991,0.0004651162790697991,0.0004651162790697991,0.0004651162790697991,0.0004651162790697991,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
54087,3,"Waste of Money I hardly ever write reviews but I felt the need to on this item . I bought the senseo deluxe last night , I wanted the deluxe model so that I could also make tea . The setup was quick and easy and the price was great compared to the competition . Here 's the problem , I brewed a cup of coffee and this was the weakest coffee EVER and I 'm not even a big coffee drinker . To make matters worse each pod only makes 4 oz of coffee . Who drinks only 4 ounces of anything . You would need to use 2 pods just to make 8 oz and then the coffee is still weak . Which is wear the waste of money comes in . The senseo pods are the same price as the home cafe pods but you will go through them twice as fast . I personally ended up returning this machine and getting a tassimo this morning . I originally bought the Senseo because I did nt want to spend Tassimo money but in the end you pay for what you get . Now the tassimo is great . I 've made hot chocolate for my daughter and tea for my son . Everyone likes it .

54122,3,"Do Not Buy This Product ! ! In theory , this is a good machine . It did , in fact , work as advertised for a brief time - then it started to smell . All of the urine , drinks , vomit , whatever nasty stuff you just vaccumed up from your carpet , starts to pool under the holding tank . As it festers there , the exhaust fan takes that wonderful aroma and blows it all over your house . This , to an extent , is simply a nuisance - bad smell and extra clean - up of the machine itself - until it starts leaking all of that crap back into your carpet , making more mess than you started with . The first time this happened , Bissell customer service sent a replacement unit . We started having the same problems with it shortly after we received it . Bissell only wants to send us another ( no doubt defective ) unit - so unless you want to be stuck with a stinky , urine - leaking , mess - maker , do n't buy this product !",195,0,0.0005555555555556026,0.0005555555555556026,0.0005555555555556026,0.0005555555555556026,0.05897933919494371,0.031248291678573705,0.0005555555555556026,0.0005555555555556026,0.0005555555555556026,0.0005555555555556026,0.07362250988621698,0.05611111111111389,0.14338653410635238,0.0005555555555556026,0.028333333333333117,0.0005555555555556026,0.0005555555555556026,0.06961828255180888,0.0005555555555556026,0.03255910619114597,0.0005555555555556026,0.0005555555555556026,0.06781860702144023,0.03183854940744821,0.0005555555555556026,0.0005555555555556026,0.0005555555555556026,0.0005555555555556026,0.0005555555555556026,0.0005555555555556026,0.0005555555555556026,0.0005555555555556026,0.0005555555555556026,0.0005555555555556026,0.0005555555555556026,0.0005555555555556026,0.0005555555555556026,0.0005555555555556026,0.0005555555555556026,0.08990480719743917,0.0005555555555556026,0.0005555555555556026,0.0005555555555556026,0.0005555555555556026,0.2561646123673809,0.0398593603972454,0.0005555555555556026,0.0005555555555556026,0.0005555555555556026,0.0005555555555556026,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0

54129,3,"Cute , but useless This item is metal and looks like an old fashioned ice crusher , but it is so small that it is useless . Its only 9 inches tall , so if you are expecting a nice big heavy duty machine , forget it . I bought it because I missed the ice in the door of my old fridge , but after trying it several times , I sent it back . It is so small that you rap your knuckles on the counter . I do nt think there is a glass made that is small enough to fit in it , so you have to use the little tin cup that comes with it . I takes about three loads of ice to fill the cup , and about 2 cups to fill a glass . You need 4 hands to operate it : 1 to hold the lid , 1to turn the crank,1to keep it from bouncing all over the place , and 1 to hold the little tin cup in place ( it slides out and then the ice lands on the base ) . Then when you finally get a cup fulll of ice , you have to try to get it out of the tin cup and into your glass . I broke the glass the first time i tried it . It hass little rubber feet that fall out and disapear , making it even more wobbly . But as I said in the begging , it IS cute",260,0,0.00047619047619050264,0.3307326980376127,0.00047619047619050264,0.04095767897011091,0.0319572462617499,0.06226056338414262,0.00047619047619050264,0.00047619047619050264,0.00047619047619050264,0.00047619047619050264,0.00047619047619050264,0.00047619047619050264,0.13517788516093587,0.00047619047619050264,0.00047619047619050264,0.00047619047619050264,0.00047619047619050264,0.00047619047619050264,0.024285714285714036,0.1959453255449469,0.00047619047619050264,0.00047619047619050264,0.00047619047619050264,0.05760420401110109,0.053224479347564566,0.00047619047619050264,0.00047619047619050264,0.00047619047619050264,0.00047619047619050264,0.048806585948501395,0.00047619047619050264,0.00047619047619050264,0.00047619047619050264,0.00047619047619050264,0.00047619047619050264,0.00047619047619050264,0.00047619047619050264,0.00047619047619050264,0.00047619047619050264,0.00047619047619050264,0.00047619047619050264,0.00047619047619050264,0.00047619047619050264,0.00047619047619050264,0.00047619047619050264,0.00047619047619050264,0.00047619047619050264,0.00047619047619050264,0.00047619047619050264,0.00047619047619050264,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
54131,3,"A blender I wish I could like This blender is frustrating . It offers good points , but in the end , the flaws outweigh the benefits . First the good : The heavy glass base is stable and easy to clean . The powerful motor hacks through most foods with ease . When the blender is started , the motor begins at a low speed for a second or two before turning on fully . The problems I found led me to toss the blender . If you plan on making blended soups , beware of the explosive force with which this beast turns on . Without a heavy hand on the lid , both the lid and your soup will hit the ceiling . Moderately thick , viscous liquids ( a lemon cream was the latest such one I experienced ) tend to get caught in the scalloped swoops in the jar . This leads to only the center portion of the liquid being actively blended , while the outer edges stagnate and remain clumpy . Deft work with a spatula is required to coax everything into the blending area . The above problems were annoying , caused occasional swearing , but were tolerable . What finally got me shopping for a replacement was worse . After several years of moderate use , the KitchenAid stopped working . The blades and motor are connected via a set of rubber teeth . These reduce operating noise , but over time , weaken . The problem first arose when making smoothies with chunky frozen fruit such as strawberries . A burning rubber smell came from the blender coupled with a strange noise and no action in the container . The rubber drive teeth slipped , and friction quickly heated them up . The result was hot , floppy rubber teeth that bent flat instead of turning the blades . When this happens , it takes 20 minutes or more before the teeth are capable of another round of use . Before long the blender could not even swirl water for more than a few seconds before the teeth slipped",359,0,0.00048780487804882293,0.10932799039578128,0.00048780487804882293,0.00048780487804882293,0.00048780487804882293,0.00048780487804882293,0.00048780487804882293,0.00048780487804882293,0.00048780487804882293,0.00048780487804882293,0.00048780487804882293,0.00048780487804882293,0.00048780487804882293,0.00048780487804882293,0.00048780487804882293,0.00048780487804882293,0.11970570511243468,0.00048780487804882293,0.049268292682929385,0.00048780487804882293,0.00048780487804882293,0.00048780487804882293,0.07318817083311033,0.00048780487804882293,0.00048780487804882293,0.016118000997636692,0.00048780487804882293,0.00048780487804882293,0.00048780487804882293,0.00048780487804882293,0.00048780487804882293,0.00048780487804882293,0.17904211215394597,0.00048780487804882293,0.00048780487804882293,0.00048780487804882293,0.00048780487804882293,0.00048780487804882293,0.00048780487804882293,0.20254350370034682,0.048007983062912304,0.024878048946452087,0.15840799699249736,0.00048780487804882293,0.00048780487804882293,0.00048780487804882293,0.00048780487804882293,0.00048780487804882293,0.00048780487804882293,0.00048780487804882293,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

54155,3,"Another victim of exploding pyrex Well I m the newest victim of exploding pyrex . Last night I was cooking some salmon in my 3-quart pyrex that I 've had for 3 years and used many times before . It was in my oven at 400 for only 25 minutes . I pulled it out and set it on the counter . Well I leaned in to check the salmon and as I pulled away the glass exploded ! Not just broke but a full on explosion of glass flying everywhere . Thankfully I pulled away when I did because if I had pulled away 2 seconds later I would have had a face full of Pyrex shrapnel . I came away with only a few small cuts on my stomach ... and from what I 've heard I was lucky . Even though my boyfriend and I swept and vacumed our kitchen last night there was so much glass that in the morning light I could still see little pieces of glass all over the kitchen . I m not taking any chances , I m throwing out my other Pyrex dishes and switching to all aluminum trays . Please DO NOT USE PYREX ! It is not worth the risk ! You may have a few years of good use , but is it worth risking your safety or that of your children?Edit- I would just like to comment that I was using the dish within the guidelines . The oven was 400 and the dish was only in there for 25 minutes . The kitchen was rather warm and the surface I set it on was not hot but definately not cool ... so there was no drastic temperature change . There were no scratches or cuts any where on the tray so I do not feel that the explosion was in anyway my fault . This explosion was purely the result of a poorly manufactured item",330,0,0.0004255319148936766,0.16806754593699955,0.0004255319148936766,0.0004255319148936766,0.0004255319148936766,0.0004255319148936766,0.02261020685598375,0.0004255319148936766,0.0004255319148936766,0.0004255319148936766,0.0004255319148936766,0.0004255319148936766,0.0004255319148936766,0.0004255319148936766,0.0004255319148936766,0.0004255319148936766,0.13507046743417478,0.0004255319148936766,0.06425531914894435,0.10469520438387933,0.0004255319148936766,0.0004255319148936766,0.0004255319148936766,0.0004255319148936766,0.0004255319148936766,0.10994139779832557,0.02350303942975395,0.0004255319148936766,0.0004255319148936766,0.0004255319148936766,0.0004255319148936766,0.0004255319148936766,0.0004255319148936766,0.0004255319148936766,0.03403358842815616,0.0004255319148936766,0.0004255319148936766,0.0004255319148936766,0.0004255319148936766,0.0004255319148936766,0.19326675200314591,0.0004255319148936766,0.021757650256036497,0.0004255319148936766,0.0004255319148936766,0.0004255319148936766,0.10620308364374674,0.0004255319148936766,0.0004255319148936766,0.0004255319148936766,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
54157,3,"Great coffee but too easy to break I was given this coffee maker for a birthday gift a couple of years ago and after I figured out how to make it work , loved it . After a while the latch on the top broke off and I had to hold the top down while it was grinding the coffee . That made the timer on it useless unless you propped something against it to hold the top down . It was a little inconvenient but I got use to it . Then the metal filter broke and I decided to get a new one . Luckily I put the old one in the garage for "" spare parts "" because not long after I started using the new one the side tab broke off and I had to grab a replacement off the old one .

I followed instructions and cleaned it throughly and put my recipe misture and miniture sausages in it to slowly heat and to use as an appetizer . I put the the heat setting on warm as I was not in a hurry and I left the room for about 5 minutes . When I came back there was mixture all over my cabinets , counters , etc . and what was left was boiling and sputtering like mad .

54183,3,"Read all reviews before you buy To be fair , the design is great looking , size is ideal , and very functional . However , beware of quality and packaging . Whoever packaged this in Thailand did not take care , it has nicks and scratches everywhere .. not to mention the dings in corners . Paint in all the panels is inconsistent .. therefore , you can see different colorations throughout different panels . It is somewhat redish in stain tone , could be darker to be a true dark walnut . Manufacturing flaws such as missing drill holes , which makes it tough when assembling ... got screws , just missing screw holes . I only recommend to those with a nack of wood handyman , not for the average person . Recommend you need the following tools : Drill with phillips screw heads and drill bits(just in case ) , small bottle of dark wood stain(to touch up painting the scratches ) , and some patience . To continue , beware when placing this table on a true flat surface , it may have uneven stance ... ok on carpeting . And beware if displaying in bright lit areas ... people may see the different paint tones , and difference between the two table .

54185,3,"Broke after limited use My Screwpull Lever model broke after opening roughly 40 bottles over 1+year . Locked up and when I pulled a little harder it stripped a gear ( the notches into which the gear meshes are only plastic . ) I suspect the lockup during the twist - cork - in -then - lift - up cycle was due to worn part within the screw housing . In any event , it 's unacceptable for something this expensive to fail withsuch limited use . At the very least , the gear mechanism should be stainless steel vice metal - plastic to provide better wear . Plus , we just talking about a stupid corkscrew . How hard /costly would it be to build something decent vice a piece of overpriced yuppy crap ? ?",137,0,0.0013333333333334359,0.0013333333333334359,0.0013333333333334359,0.06895418553135699,0.0013333333333334359,0.0013333333333334359,0.0013333333333334359,0.0013333333333334359,0.0013333333333334359,0.0013333333333334359,0.0013333333333334359,0.0013333333333334359,0.10480759401721655,0.0013333333333334359,0.06647210642887594,0.0013333333333334359,0.0013333333333334359,0.0013333333333334359,0.0013333333333334359,0.0013333333333334359,0.0013333333333334359,0.13140137121333165,0.0013333333333334359,0.06937844586692657,0.0013333333333334359,0.0013333333333334359,0.0013333333333334359,0.0013333333333334359,0.0013333333333334359,0.0013333333333334359,0.0013333333333334359,0.0013333333333334359,0.0013333333333334359,0.0013333333333334359,0.0013333333333334359,0.0013333333333334359,0.0013333333333334359,0.0013333333333334359,0.0013333333333334359,0.15437173237827678,0.0013333333333334359,0.0013333333333334359,0.0013333333333334359,0.0013333333333334359,0.0013333333333334359,0.0013333333333334359,0.3472812312306778,0.0013333333333334359,0.0013333333333334359,0.0013333333333334359,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

54198,3,"Leaks coffee while brewing 8 out of 10 times As another reviewer experienced , our Krups also leaks coffee all over the counter and subsequently the floor quite often , which is apparently related to having to have the carafe situated in just exactly the right place within a half a millimeter , and which place I have not yet discovered except occasionally by chance . Carafe positioning appears to be the problem , because it does n't leak every time . Maybe my unit is defective , because other reviewers do n't mention this , and believe me , you would notice this if it were occurring with yours . The opening to pour in water is relatively small , but I do n't have a huge problem with it . Be aware there is no automatic shut off . It makes a fine cup of coffee for this non - coffee - gourmet , and I do n't have a problem with spilling when I pour from the carafe into a cup . But the leaking is forcing me to find another machine . I wish I could find a reasonably - priced , non - leaking 12-cup machine with removable water reservoir , no - drip carafe , programmable , auto shut - off , easy - to - find replacement carafe and removable filter basket but alas , even on amazon.com , that machine does not appear to exist .

54227,3,"High price but cheap parts The Littermaid Mega is absolutely one of the worst purchases I have ever made . In less than two months time , the unsubstantial motor has burned out completely . Litter Maid claims that the boxes should need to be emptied every five days for one cat . Well , I have two cats and had to empty the box two times daily . The Litter Maid is good for controlling odors when it works , but it constantly jammed and then shut down ( and I used a recommended brand of premium cat litter ) . After a few weeks of this load , the tiny ( and very loud ) motor simply gave up . I 'm waiting to hear from Litter Maid regarding warranty repair / replacement , but I suspect I 'll end up returning to a traditional $ 5.00 litter tray .

54248,3,"Poorly designed lid This is a gorgeous ice bucket . It is large and stylish . However , I can not recommend it because of the lid . The lid is attached to the bucket and does not come completely off . Instead , it pivots and swings up . The problem with this is that you can not fill the bucket all the way up with ice because you have to leave a good amount of room at the top for the lid to swing . And , because the lid is not removable , it gets in the way especially if you want to use this bucket as a champagne / wine cooler . Poor design flaw . I want an ice bucket that I can remove the lid and put it aside if I do n't need to use it rather than having it sticking up and in the way . You 'll notice in OXO 's main picture of this bucket on this site it is shown without the lid sticking up . Why ? Because it makes for a cleaner look not having the lid in the way . Hey OXO , that 's the same look I wanted this bucket to have sitting on my bar ! Would it have killed OXO to put a knob / handle on the lid and let the customer decide if they want the lid on or off ? I swear sometimes I think manufacturers never bother actually testing out the things they design . If they had , surely they would have noticed how bad their lid idea was . Or they could have looked at every other ice bucket on the market to see that theirs is the only one in which the lid does n't come off . That should have been a clue to them that there are obvious merits to having a removable lid . This bucket has a clear plastic lid . I do n't understand why it 's plastic at all . First of all , it 's an ice bucket ! I think everyone knows ice is inside without needing to peek through the lid . Secondly , a metal lid will keep the temperature inside colder longer than than a plastic lid . That is why the bucket is made of metal , not plastic . Metal is a better conductor of heat and cold . I wish I had noticed the lid before I purchased it . I did n't pay close enough attention . I suppose I assumed it was a normal lid that came off like all the others . Thankfully I got the bucket from my local Bed Bath and Beyond making its return very easy . I am sorry I have to return it because this really is a nice looking bucket . However , I do n't intend to spend $ 40 on an ice bucket just to sit there , look pretty and receive compliments -- that 's my job as hostess :-) . I want an ice bucket that is functional too . Oh , well ... my search for the perfect ice bucket continues .",535,0,0.3305897379193382,0.13890092226612097,0.030554531634698106,0.00024691358024693516,0.00024691358024693516,0.00024691358024693516,0.00024691358024693516,0.00024691358024693516,0.03993539809769609,0.00024691358024693516,0.029607466947085166,0.00024691358024693516,0.0901041512527537,0.00024691358024693516,0.01259259259259106,0.00024691358024693516,0.10341311939232722,0.00024691358024693516,0.00024691358024693516,0.00024691358024693516,0.00024691358024693516,0.00024691358024693516,0.00024691358024693516,0.00024691358024693516,0.00024691358024693516,0.00024691358024693516,0.00024691358024693516,0.00024691358024693516,0.00024691358024693516,0.0335245825543682,0.00024691358024693516,0.00024691358024693516,0.018681054393723695,0.00024691358024693516,0.00024691358024693516,0.00024691358024693516,0.00024691358024693516,0.00024691358024693516,0.00024691358024693516,0.16246681331966736,0.00024691358024693516,0.00024691358024693516,0.00024691358024693516,0.00024691358024693516,0.00024691358024693516,0.00024691358024693516,0.00024691358024693516,0.00024691358024693516,0.00024691358024693516,0.00024691358024693516,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Yes , deLonghi makes a great product . No , this is not one of them .

I bought mine from Costco , and sometimes the manufacturers do something different for Costco product runs . I hope that is not the problem , but that is all I can think of that would be causing such a disparity of reviews . So ... who else bought this unit from Costco ?

And just for the record , I did not use lemon detergent , and I only allowed the set to stay in the dishwasher a short while after the cycle completed .

54313,3,"Tried it , hated it , returned it I needed a compact cleaner to tidy up after my delightful cat decided to soil my couch . I had read other reviews of the Bissell Little Green Machine that were unfavourable , so headed off to the store to find something else . . . . the Atlantis Express looked interesting , and I had n't seen it before . Suffice to say , it did get the cat stains out of the couch , but not after revealing itself as a really poorly designed product.- The machine is LOUD , very loud- The cleaning ' head ' on the end of the hose has a ' flip - up ' cover to make it easier to clean where it sucks in lint and stuff into the machine . That is a great idea , but there is no gasket to make the joints true and tight . . .. so while it may have 2 times the power of other machines based on sheer power of the motor , it looses some of this power when you actually use it to try and suck water and cleaning solution back up.- The option to spray water and solution or just clean water is part of what appealed to me about this machine . However to accomplish this , the cleaning head has 2 seperate spayers on the underside . Neither are centered , the one on the left operates when you have the slider set to solution and the one to the right operates when you have slider set to rinse . As they are not centered , they overspray quite a bit past the edge of the cleaning tool . Mine sprayed a wide swath of rinse water about 3 inches past the edge of the cleaning head . To top it off , when you release the trigger , the cleaning head continues to drip water for a few moments , meaning that you have to go VERY slowly or risk dripping everywhere . While it functioned well enough to clean my couch , it was a brutal and terrible experience . When I bought it I figured it could be used too on my car interior . . . . but the frustration of cleaning a small patch on my couch quickly quelled that thougt . I returned the Atlantis Express to the store and went out and bought a Hoover Steam Vac Jr. -- which I should have done right from the start--- the hoover runs circles around this machine",433,0,0.1911296409139077,0.00028571428571431555,0.00028571428571431555,0.00028571428571431555,0.12040038814956383,0.00028571428571431555,0.00028571428571431555,0.00028571428571431555,0.00028571428571431555,0.00028571428571431555,0.04229978734508589,0.00028571428571431555,0.12102225866020681,0.00028571428571431555,0.00028571428571431555,0.00028571428571431555,0.00028571428571431555,0.03550437796559835,0.00028571428571431555,0.019108678665980237,0.00028571428571431555,0.00028571428571431555,0.00028571428571431555,0.00028571428571431555,0.014865744020357946,0.03445695296283737,0.00028571428571431555,0.00028571428571431555,0.00028571428571431555,0.00028571428571431555,0.00028571428571431555,0.00028571428571431555,0.00028571428571431555,0.00028571428571431555,0.00028571428571431555,0.00028571428571431555,0.00028571428571431555,0.00028571428571431555,0.00028571428571431555,0.08601798233454046,0.00028571428571431555,0.04360952906479515,0.13329426017916474,0.04287780147072021,0.10484116969581186,0.00028571428571431555,0.00028571428571431555,0.00028571428571431555,0.00028571428571431555,0.00028571428571431555,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0

54365,3,"Died after two loaf Bought it two months ago , used it only twice and suddenly it stopped working within a week . Called manufacturer , got return label , sent in for replacement , but three weeks passed and I still have not received anything . So I called them on Nov 17 , 2006 , and was told they do n't have this model in stock .

54400,3,"Bad thermostat and worse customer service We also bought the FCP12 after years of hearing from satisfied Farberware users . Unfortunately it only worked about three months until it also made lukewarm , tea - like coffee . I removed the bottom and wiggled the wires and it worked great for another month or so . After a few times of this monkey business , I contacted Farberware and was told I had voided my warranty by removing a single nut from the base . The best they could offer was a refurbished unit at half price . Shipping would be on me both directions as well , I told them I would not pay any price for another one of their products , based on our experience and their lack of any desire to acknowledge the widespread problem or help to fix it . I am going to try replacing the thermostat , as I like perked coffee , but I am not convinced it will last any longer , time will tell",174,0,0.21129155023117496,0.0005263157894737355,0.0005263157894737355,0.0005263157894737355,0.036897495458758395,0.02722008215456578,0.0005263157894737355,0.0005263157894737355,0.0005263157894737355,0.0005263157894737355,0.0005263157894737355,0.0005263157894737355,0.0005263157894737355,0.0005263157894737355,0.05315789473668681,0.0005263157894737355,0.08814652046181147,0.0005263157894737355,0.0005263157894737355,0.0005263157894737355,0.0005263157894737355,0.0005263157894737355,0.14974182813844442,0.0005263157894737355,0.0005263157894737355,0.0005263157894737355,0.0005263157894737355,0.0005263157894737355,0.0005263157894737355,0.0005263157894737355,0.0005263157894737355,0.0005263157894737355,0.0005263157894737355,0.0005263157894737355,0.0005263157894737355,0.0005263157894737355,0.0005263157894737355,0.0005263157894737355,0.0005263157894737355,0.0005263157894737355,0.1397209179476398,0.0005263157894737355,0.10394355081097029,0.0005263157894737355,0.0005263157894737355,0.1683012126915248,0.0005263157894737355,0.0005263157894737355,0.0005263157894737355,0.0005263157894737355,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
54406,3,This is n't silicone ! The cutting boards are not silicone but have a thin layer of silicone sprayed over one side of another plastic that is not heat resistant . I placed a hot pan on one and it melted onto the bottom of the pan which took a great deal of effort to clean the melted plastic off so the pan could be used again . I prefer a thick cutting board so I bought these thinking that they were heat resistant so I would n't purchase them again,91,0,0.0011764705882353391,0.0011764705882353391,0.0011764705882353391,0.14768667314554057,0.11870770286965875,0.0599988466565963,0.0011764705882353391,0.0011764705882353391,0.0011764705882353391,0.0011764705882353391,0.0011764705882353391,0.0011764705882353391,0.0011764705882353391,0.0011764705882353391,0.0011764705882353391,0.0011764705882353391,0.0011764705882353391,0.0011764705882353391,0.0011764705882353391,0.0011764705882353391,0.0011764705882353391,0.0011764705882353391,0.0011764705882353391,0.0011764705882353391,0.0011764705882353391,0.0011764705882353391,0.0011764705882353391,0.0011764705882353391,0.0011764705882353391,0.11932923171203332,0.0011764705882353391,0.0011764705882353391,0.0011764705882353391,0.0011764705882353391,0.0011764705882353391,0.0011764705882353391,0.0011764705882353391,0.0011764705882353391,0.0011764705882353391,0.17775470529280935,0.0011764705882353391,0.0011764705882353391,0.07488898586285501,0.0011764705882353391,0.0011764705882353391,0.0011764705882353391,0.2510456191663872,0.0011764705882353391,0.0011764705882353391,0.0011764705882353391,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1
54411,3,"save your money I was so excited to buy these sheets as my husband and I have 600 thread count sheets that we love . These , I DO NOT love so much . This is why:1 . They are increadibly stiff . I washed them 5 times before my first use and even tried vinegar and salt washes to soften them- it did not work . They are , however , softening as we sleep on them.2 . They are so wrinkley!!3 . They barley fit the bed . The description says that is fits extra deep mattresses but it is a STRUGGLE to get them on my bed . I just read consumer reports and they recommend that you buy between 400 - 600 thread count , they contend more than that is unnecessary for a soft , nice sheet . My 600 thread count sheets are much more soft and have very few wrinkles .

54421,3,"The thermometer is only as good as the probe . I purchased this product 4 years ago and have replaced the probe three times for about $ 7 each . The latest probe just malfunctioned . I really loved it at first ... perfectly roasted chickens , loin roasts , and turkeys . Oddly enough , the thermometer works great but the probe itself is n't designed to handle much time in the oven . If you like to roast your chickens in a hot 400 degree oven , the probe will eventually stop working or will become completely unreliable . Even at lower temperatures , the heat finally takes its ' toll ... it just takes longer for it to happen . One would think that something designed to be left in the oven would be able to take the heat . I will buy yet another probe because when this thing is working , it is great .

54458,3,Hamilton Beach 40616 Perculator Does n't Last My wife and I purchased the 40616 Hamilton Beach Perculator at K - Mart . After only 8 months of service the perculator would not keep the coffee hot -- only luke warm . K - Mart refused to do anything about the problem because they only warranty the coffee pot for 90 days . This should give you an idea of what K - Mart thinks of the quality of the Hamilton Beach 40616 perculator . When I called Hamilton Beach customer no - service I was told to send in the cord from the coffee pot and a check for $ 9.95 and they would replace their defective equipment . The $ 9.95is 25 % of the original price of the perculator so I will decline their offer . If their perculator only last for 8 months I do n't even want to pay the $ 9.95 to get a new one . I feel that it should have been replaced for free ! In their warranty booklet they tell you that the 40616 perculator has a limited 2-year warranty but that is only if you are willing to pay $ 9.95 to ship their defective equipment back to them . Because of this experience with the Hamilton Beach 40616 coffee perculator I will never purchase any Hamilton Beach equipment in the future . I will also not purchase anything else from K - Mart,244,0,0.22843844338235578,0.00058823529411769,0.11463553777999098,0.056325250554878505,0.00058823529411769,0.05950342529152122,0.00058823529411769,0.00058823529411769,0.00058823529411769,0.00058823529411769,0.00058823529411769,0.00058823529411769,0.00058823529411769,0.00058823529411769,0.029999999999999583,0.00058823529411769,0.09866453516296962,0.00058823529411769,0.00058823529411769,0.00058823529411769,0.00058823529411769,0.00058823529411769,0.03891737109297868,0.03748043191979334,0.031011074208167767,0.00058823529411769,0.00058823529411769,0.00058823529411769,0.00058823529411769,0.00058823529411769,0.00058823529411769,0.00058823529411769,0.00058823529411769,0.00058823529411769,0.00058823529411769,0.00058823529411769,0.00058823529411769,0.00058823529411769,0.04609108334222583,0.00058823529411769,0.05174487294777058,0.00058823529411769,0.1365940899249246,0.00058823529411769,0.00058823529411769,0.048829178510068766,0.00058823529411769,0.00058823529411769,0.00058823529411769,0.00058823529411769,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

54503,3,"Faulty electronics The salesclerk told us that because of previous model recalls , that the new KitchenAid was sure to be a huge improvement , especially with it 's price tag . We 've tried 2 models and both had problems with error messages . The manual 's suggestions do nothing to eliminate this . Also , we 've had the same trouble with coffee spewing out . For the price tag , this is a seriously disappointing coffee maker . We finally took it back and are on the look out for a better quality model ( NOT KitchenAid ) . Oddly enough , our other KitchenAid appliances ( range and fridge ) have also had electronic problems .

I started looking for places to store it so that it would n't wake me up at night or disturb me with it 's annoying hum first thing in the morning . But I did n't have to worry , but the next morning the batteries were dead . I replaced them and within 24 hours they were all dead again ! There is no place to plug it in so you 're stuck with using batteries . I 'm going to try buying rechargables but I do n't know how long I 'm going to want to keep this replacement going!!P.S. I found it interesting that after I post my negative review three 5 star reviews appear from people who have no review history and NONE of them address the battery issue .

54551,3,"Black Goo and Funny Smell The design is ok . Nothing fancy , nothing different , it looks just like any other teakettle . It works fine . The handle does n't get hot , and the whistle is n't too loud . I gave it one star because of the black goo that came inside . I washed it before using it , and after the water was done boiling , I saw little black particles floating in the water and the water smelled weird . The smell may have been caused by that black stuff . I washed the pot again and saw more black stuff coming out . I took one piece and noticed it was gooey . I checked if there was something that had melted when I boiled the water , but I saw the kettle was intact . I boiled more water and again I saw the black goo floating in the water . I have boiled water 7 times and have washed the pot 4 times , and there is still goo floating in the water , they are almost unnoticeable , like very tiny dots , but they are there . At least the funny smell is gone . I do n't know what that black goo is or what 's causing it or where it 's coming from . I 'm afraid it may contain dangerous metals or chemicals that can be harmful . If I keep seeing black goo , I 'm sending it back . I think I 've learned my lesson . When it comes to buying cookware , it 's better to buy good quality . It 's not worth jeopardizing your health to save a few bucks . Update : After washing it two more times and boiling water one more time I got rid of the goo .

54585,3,"The Chemical Smell is Real After reading the reviews here saying that the chemical smell mentioned by others was not a problem for them , I went ahead and ordered this rice cooker . After I received the cooker , I was a little disappointed to find that it was made in china , rather than japan , and that there were some very noticeable imperfections in the fit and finish . I made sure to remove the shipping paper under the pot , and wash the pot and lid thoroughly , but upon trying it out I was disappointed to find that my cooker did in fact emit an acrid chemical smell that filled my apartment . It was the kind of smell that you more feel in your nose than actually smell . The smell also flavored the rice , which was most noticeable after letting it cool and airing out the apartment . Aside from this problem , though , the rice , which was standard japanese style white short grain , came out perfectly . I returned this cooker and ordered the Panasonic SR - NA18 , which should arrive tomorrow . I have compared a few rice cookers at my local asian store , and this Panasonic model seems better built than the newer ( I believe ) Panasonic SR - LA18 , plus I believe it is made in Japan ( I 'll have to check when mine arrives ) . I also highly recommend the Zojirushi 10-cup "" Neuro Fuzzy "" model ( NS - JCC18 / NS - ZCC18 ) .

54617,3,"Spout that spills and leaks .... for shame ! Who had the bright idea with putting the spout so low that this thing will boil thru so easily ? since it does n't make any noise that it is boiling , you know when the water start to burst thru the spout area and it is not a good thing . And what is up with the leaky spout in the weld area anyways ? Welding is a skill that if done right , it would NOT leak ! The handle will get hot so wear your glove . On the plus side , the stainless steel looks very nice which is why i bought it in the first place . I use to have a cheap tea pot that cost half the price of this one and it was more reliable ( lasted 2 years ) so that just goes to show that just because it cost more , it do n't mean it would last longer . Mine start to leak after 4 months . I am going to buy that cheap one again if they still makes it . Overall , i can not recommend this tea pot due to the spout flaw .",207,0,0.349653468086682,0.0005263157894737111,0.0005263157894737111,0.0005263157894737111,0.0005263157894737111,0.0005263157894737111,0.0005263157894737111,0.0005263157894737111,0.0005263157894737111,0.0005263157894737111,0.0005263157894737111,0.025383856768451587,0.0005263157894737111,0.0005263157894737111,0.02684210523610029,0.0005263157894737111,0.1011223536289282,0.06196087264452796,0.0005263157894737111,0.0005263157894737111,0.0005263157894737111,0.0005263157894737111,0.0005263157894737111,0.0005263157894737111,0.0005263157894737111,0.0005263157894737111,0.0005263157894737111,0.0005263157894737111,0.0005263157894737111,0.0005263157894737111,0.0005263157894737111,0.0005263157894737111,0.21708204620316263,0.0005263157894737111,0.0005263157894737111,0.0005263157894737111,0.0005263157894737111,0.0005263157894737111,0.0005263157894737111,0.0005263157894737111,0.04737140286478077,0.0005263157894737111,0.11987596178647125,0.0005263157894737111,0.0005263157894737111,0.0005263157894737111,0.029128985412473104,0.0005263157894737111,0.0005263157894737111,0.0005263157894737111,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

54658,3,"Refurbished Product is Garbage I can not recommend purchase of the refurbished Roomba Discovery 4210 . While I think the product did a good job on BARE floors ( not carpet ) , now after only 4 months of light use ( we only used in the kitchen / den area of our home ) , the unit is trashed . The refurb warranty is only 90 days and that 's apparently all the machine is good for . I purchased a new APS fast charger in an attempt to rule that problem out , but it did nothing . This seems to be typical of this vacuum since the Roomba rep I talked to told me that if the charger failed the Roomba was "" probably trashed "" . She was right .

54681,3,"Wrong description on site ! Very , very , disappointed and irritated . HUMBUG , I ordered this rice cooker and I just received it today . I really wish , I had read some of the reviews above . The description on this site clearly states that the rice cooker stays warm for 5 hours ! The manual clearly states it does NOT . I bought it because of the keep warm for 5 hours promise . I can get a CHEAP , basic cook and shut off at Wal - Mart for $ 12 here in Georgia . I 'll be sending it back tomorrow , and I 'm very upset that I have to take the time to do it , HUMBUG!~ I like Amazon .com , but I 'm really mad about this .

54693,3,"Function Fails to Follow Form Like most reviewers , I found these glasses to be elegantly modern and sleekly minimalist . Like a number of other reviewers , I found that one of my glasses leaked . Unlike one other reviewer , I was unable to eliminate the water between the glass ' walls in the microwave , and when I tried to do so the glass became very hot because of the steam produced . To my mind , elegance of form can never compensate for a failure of functional design . 5 stars for form , 1 star for function : 2 stars total . Addendum : I liked the form of these glasses so much that I bought two more at my local coffee house , knowing that if either leaked I could easily return it . Neither did , and they 're a pleasure to use .

The timer quit working and the band rivets around the jar are rusty . The only things I like about it are that it is easy to clean and the jar is nice and big .

54713,3,Poor design After using this product twice I was extremly disapointed . The drip tray does not catch all the dripping from frying bacon . The grease ends up all over the counter and melting the base unit that the drip tray fits in . You would think Wolfgang Puck would try this product under all conditions to make sure it is enginered corectly . My counters are level so this is not an issue . I am a dissatisfied customer .,82,0,0.0014285714285715027,0.0014285714285715027,0.07395983776509926,0.0014285714285715027,0.0014285714285715027,0.0014285714285715027,0.0014285714285715027,0.0014285714285715027,0.07362701756864712,0.0014285714285715027,0.14496546224541557,0.0014285714285715027,0.3090155642324618,0.0014285714285715027,0.07285714285714406,0.0014285714285715027,0.0014285714285715027,0.0014285714285715027,0.0014285714285715027,0.0014285714285715027,0.0014285714285715027,0.0014285714285715027,0.0907304986078298,0.0014285714285715027,0.0014285714285715027,0.0014285714285715027,0.0014285714285715027,0.0014285714285715027,0.0014285714285715027,0.0014285714285715027,0.0014285714285715027,0.0014285714285715027,0.0014285714285715027,0.0014285714285715027,0.0014285714285715027,0.0014285714285715027,0.0014285714285715027,0.0014285714285715027,0.11345325195810814,0.0014285714285715027,0.0014285714285715027,0.0014285714285715027,0.0014285714285715027,0.0014285714285715027,0.0014285714285715027,0.0014285714285715027,0.061391224765291276,0.0014285714285715027,0.0014285714285715027,0.0014285714285715027,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

54723,3,"More problems than pluses I bought one and the plate that diffused the air was off center so it baked unevenly . I called and was told it was a defect and would do a warranty exchange . I was under the impression they would send it out but when I called , I was told I was supposed to send in $ 14.95 for shipping or I could give them a charge card and they would charge it again to ship out a new one and credit when I returned it . The new unit I received has had problems with the digital timer displaying the timer but rather than to have a short so rat her than do the return thing again I just used a manual timer . It baked a bit more evenly and was fast but still needed to rotate pans . I just recently had a power spike that took out all electronics plugged in , including the oven but I doubt I will reorder this product .

54757,3,"Auto - ShutOff is incompatible with sewing and quilting The Professional label on this product is a big misnomer . Ask frequent sewers and quilters what they hated the most about the last iron they replaced and they will almost invariably refer to leaking and the auto - shutoff feature if present . Typically , they press seams as a batch and go back to sewing ... only to return to a iron that has shut off and requires a reheating cycle . The auto - shutoff on this model makes it poorly suited for the sewing room where the ' professional ' label should apply . This ( and other ) Rowenta iron produces good steam and can burst steam to a certain extent . However , usually between 6 months and 1.5 yrs , Rowentas begin to drip . The valve design just does n't hold up to water hardness that long . Failure number two . For garment sewers and quilters , a professional system with a separate water boiler ( tank ) works far better : * wo n't shut off on you * since the iron does n't make the steam ( the boiler does ) , the sole does n't have the ' hot spot ' where household irons drip the water to make steam , which tends to scorch fabrics * true professional models have a thicker sole which will maintain a more even temperature ( still without the hot spot)I teach sewing classes ( garment , home dec , totes , etc . ) and have completely walked away from household iron designs like this one . You will not see this type of iron in a commercial workshop . Noone there would have the time to wait for the iron to get hot again every time you 've been away from it . This iron is a better than average housesold model , designed for ' ironing ' your laundry and not for pressing in a sewing room . For general ironing duty ( like laundry ) , check out the T - Fal 1759 Ultraglide Diffusion Iron for about half the price . My t - fal irons ( i 've had 2 ) have outlasted my Rowenta iron , with just as good a performance and with the advantage of the ultraglide sole , a ceramic - like sole coating that does not scratch , even over metal zippers ( the stainless steal sole on the rowenta WILL scratch over metal zipper)Rating this ( and similar ) Rowenta as a conventional household iron : Performance 5Durability 3 ( before it begins dripping)As a sewing room iron : 2Overall Rating : 2 ( because they label the product as professional , where it fails to the task)P.S. : for any household iron , be sure to empty the water tank after use to prolong the life of your iron .

54828,3,"Exquisite product -as long as you do n't intend to use it . This stunning slice of kitchen couture is undoubtedly a tactile and aesthetic dream - built with quality materials like real metal ( not silvery plastic ) , and sporting a sophisticated , drop - dead gorgeous retro appeal . It looks equally as impressive in the hippest New York loft kitchens as it does on the shelves of Williams - Sonoma . However , as is the case when function follows form , this is a horrible blender . Do n't get me wrong - I 'm more than willing to forgive a modicum of piss - poor functionality if the design is attractive enough to render the former irrelevant . But quite frankly , this blender is beyond bad . Most unfortunate is the blender 's propensity to splash everywhere - even when the user deliberately reinforces the lid onto the jar by hand . It seems to make little difference how much or what type of liquid one is mixing ; it inevitably overflows with explosive fervor . I suspect that the unit 's quasi - industrial motor may be a contributing factor ; it only supports two speeds : off , and jet - cyclonic . While I admit that the minimalist toggle switch is profoundly chic in its own right , the consequences of omitting ramp - up speeds are overbearing , consistently messy , predictably inconvenient , and potentially dangerous ( as liquid tends to flow liberally into the motor housing ) . The irregular cloverleaf shaped jar also seems to play a role in splattering liquids upward ; and the blender 's poorly - sealed lid does little to stop it from overflowing in dramatic fashion . In fact , this blender splashes so profusely that it 's nearly unusable . It 's too bad , because superficially , this blender really is quite the objet d'art . But when it comes to meeting the minimum requirements for acceptable performance , it has a long way to go - even in comparison to a $ 29 Oster . If I had to summarize this blender as accurately , succinctly , and fairly as possible , I 'd distill it down to one word - "" regrettable .

54845,3,"Bought this and hate it ! Just purchased this blender and am returning it immediately . It has a number of terrible features : it 's very difficult to remove the cover if you have carpal tunnel , arthritis , or weak hands . To change speeds you turn a dial ( as opposed to the buttons on most others ) , which makes for rough transitions . Moreover , the dial feels very flimsy and I doubt this machine will last . I purchased this model because I thought its premium price would mean a premium product , but from the plastic gears to the flimsy dial , to the impossible - to - open cover , I hate it .

54855,3,Not a good foam pump . The soap shoots straight out of the pump and can go about three feet . ( Children would love this feature . ) You have to hold your hand awkwardly in front of the spout to keep the soap in your hand or pick up the pump and pump it directly into your palm . Also the pump sticks and has to be pulled up manually .

54953,3,"Be cautious when purchasing I had received this set for my Birthday from a friend . When we unpacked the set we noticed the 8 Quart pot was scratched on the interior . This made the non - stick aspect of the pot worthless . I gave the pots back to my friend and he returned them to Amazon and had a new set sent out . When we received the new set the 8 quart pot again had scratches inside the pot . I thought I would contact Calphalon to inquire about the damage and see what they had to say . I called the Calphalon customer service number but was on hold for so long I gave up . In retrospect I would spend the extra money and stay away from the non - stick surfaces with teflon coating which are prone to scratch easily . If you get the Calphalon One Infused - Anodized pans which you will never have to replace let alone deal with the lack of customer service . Remember the old saying "" you get what you pay for . "" I do n't think these non - stick pans will look very good after a years worth of use .

54966,3,"Cooks Only Meats Well ; Cleaning is a real Bear I bought this with a lot of expectations hoping to cook indoor healthy grilled meats during winter . As soon as I saw the pan I was a little disappointed with the ridges . They are deep ( which is good ) but very thin and not thick as it appears in the product photos . So your meats will be less brown . After rubbing it with a litlle oil before cooking I set out to make my first set of turkey burgers . Now the way I make my burgers is by adding some chopped onions , garlic , and green chillies to the ground meat . That is where the pan gave problems . The meat cooked ok but the small pieces of chopped onions , garlic , and chillies that fell out of the patties got burnt very fast and stuck to the pan making it difficult to clean . I spent about 20 mins cleaning each time . For cooking meat that is seasoned only this pan may be ok . For me it is sitting in the closet after two tries . I did not return it because the shipping costs would have made returning it too expensive in itself . Update ( 12/18/2004 ) I bought a Hamilton Beach 31603 Electric grill for around $ 20 which is tremendous . It is non - stick , dish - washer compatible and cooks great .",251,0,0.0005000000000000337,0.1820793450616597,0.0005000000000000337,0.0005000000000000337,0.0005000000000000337,0.0005000000000000337,0.0005000000000000337,0.0005000000000000337,0.0005000000000000337,0.0005000000000000337,0.03259390266016133,0.0005000000000000337,0.0005000000000000337,0.0005000000000000337,0.0005000000000000337,0.0005000000000000337,0.0005000000000000337,0.11295859629327211,0.05050000000000202,0.0005000000000000337,0.0005000000000000337,0.0005000000000000337,0.0005000000000000337,0.0005000000000000337,0.0005000000000000337,0.054503797680991124,0.0005000000000000337,0.0005000000000000337,0.0005000000000000337,0.0005000000000000337,0.0005000000000000337,0.0005000000000000337,0.0005000000000000337,0.0005000000000000337,0.0005000000000000337,0.0005000000000000337,0.0005000000000000337,0.0005000000000000337,0.05657237501690675,0.09274736107894524,0.0005000000000000337,0.0005000000000000337,0.05038458794661233,0.0005000000000000337,0.199969684440365,0.0005000000000000337,0.147690349821083,0.0005000000000000337,0.0005000000000000337,0.0005000000000000337,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0

As a blender alone : It was not the most effective blender I have ever seen but neither was it the worst . It was truly mediocre through and through . As a smoothie maker : the mechanism used for the pour spout did n't allow any chunks to pass through , and it never quite seemed to blend well enough to break up those chunks .

55050,3,"Perfect and evenly toasted ! I have owned a lot of crappy toasters and actually have n't gotten another for the past 6 years . I 've resorted to pan toasting in order to avoid another bad purchase . Finally got tired of so much effort for toast and broke down and got this toaster . It 's so easy to use and it even defrosts frozen bread and can warm up an already toasted slice without retoasting . Worked amazingly well to heat a cold slice of pizza but I 'm sure Braun is cringing if they read this ! I love the little pull out tray , you do n't have to pick up the whole darn thing and hold it over the sink and beat it to death ! The toast comes out very even and perfectly toasted every time . Slots are wide too so a bagel is no problem . It is fast too , so you wo n't miss it not being a 4 slice toaster . I think you will be pleased with this great toaster , I am",186,1,0.0006250000000000473,0.0006250000000000473,0.0006250000000000473,0.0006250000000000473,0.049583902463643595,0.0006250000000000473,0.0006250000000000473,0.0006250000000000473,0.0006250000000000473,0.0006250000000000473,0.0006250000000000473,0.0006250000000000473,0.3795726965520554,0.0006250000000000473,0.0006250000000000473,0.0006250000000000473,0.0006250000000000473,0.0006250000000000473,0.0006250000000000473,0.0006250000000000473,0.0006250000000000473,0.0006250000000000473,0.09477019514361022,0.0006250000000000473,0.0006250000000000473,0.041686876350304505,0.0006250000000000473,0.0006250000000000473,0.0006250000000000473,0.03226776065536234,0.0006250000000000473,0.0006250000000000473,0.0006250000000000473,0.0006250000000000473,0.0006250000000000473,0.0006250000000000473,0.0006250000000000473,0.0006250000000000473,0.0006250000000000473,0.0006250000000000473,0.11721195741478856,0.0006250000000000473,0.048963150017788865,0.0006250000000000473,0.0006250000000000473,0.05264925736473832,0.15766920403770637,0.0006250000000000473,0.0006250000000000473,0.0006250000000000473,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0
55051,3,"An elegantly designed LONG and WIDE toaster The Braun HT500 is one of the best designed toasters I have ever used . What I really like .... 1 . A single long and wide slot , allowing you to toast large or unusually shaped pieces of bread . I have used it to toast very thick pieces of bread , long hoagee rolls , and those huge hamberger buns that wo n't fit in a standard toaster slot.2 . Very clean , modern appearance . Looks great sitting on the kitchen counter , whereas many of the other toaster models today look like ugly chrome spaceships from the 1950 's . Personally , I 'm not into that kind of retro look.3 . An led light that is clearly visible when the toaster is "" on "" , allowing you to quickly see the status of your toast from the other side of the room.4 . When the toast is done , it pops - up only part way . This helps keep your toast warm prior to you extracting it . You then pull the lever up a notch higher and it raises the toast up very high , making it easy to pull - out even very small pieces of bread.5 . It toasts evenly . Of course , you would expect this . But you 'd be surprised how some very expensive toasters I 've used in the past were often poor in this area . Of all those items , the first one is by far the most important . Strangely however , few manufacturers today make a long and wide toaster any longer . Braun is one of the few that does . That fact combined with the great design is reason for me to give it a hearty recommendation",305,1,0.11236556170632722,0.2586826471667227,0.04044879571803798,0.00040000000000003656,0.042070491007783595,0.00040000000000003656,0.00040000000000003656,0.0978904330441094,0.07647749711767415,0.00040000000000003656,0.00040000000000003656,0.00040000000000003656,0.00040000000000003656,0.00040000000000003656,0.00040000000000003656,0.00040000000000003656,0.00040000000000003656,0.00040000000000003656,0.00040000000000003656,0.028071090614571095,0.00040000000000003656,0.00040000000000003656,0.00040000000000003656,0.00040000000000003656,0.00040000000000003656,0.00040000000000003656,0.00040000000000003656,0.00040000000000003656,0.00040000000000003656,0.00040000000000003656,0.00040000000000003656,0.00040000000000003656,0.051360785155851026,0.00040000000000003656,0.00040000000000003656,0.00040000000000003656,0.00040000000000003656,0.00040000000000003656,0.00040000000000003656,0.07042062561330682,0.20621207285561455,0.00040000000000003656,0.00040000000000003656,0.00040000000000003656,0.00040000000000003656,0.00040000000000003656,0.00040000000000003656,0.00040000000000003656,0.00040000000000003656,0.00040000000000003656,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
55053,3,"A Step Above the Rest I have only used this blender once , but already I love it . I will update my review if anything changes . No more cheapo blenders for me ! I have tried Oster ( really bad ) , and Black and Decker from Walmart ( a tad better , but it did n't work on frozen fruit and ice).First , with the Waring , I made a frozen Island Oasis mix using ice , and the consistency was amazing . Second , since I 'm single , I absolutely love the small size ( I think it 's like 24 oz or so).Third , it 's not really that loud . I mean no louder than any other blender I 've used . Fourth , there are no cheap plastic parts ! Yay ! Only high quality parts . The jar is stainless steel . If the two top pieces are plastic or polycarbanate ( ? ) , they are of very high quality . Fifth , the blades are built into the stainless steel container , and it 's a snap to clean . Just add a cup of water , a few drops of cleaning liquid , run the blender for 30 seconds or so , rinse , dry and you 're done ! Cuts my cleaning time down considerably . Moreover , there 's no unscrewing and cheap plastic round things that always tear . There is absolutely no way that you would have problems with a leaking jar . Last , I did n't have any problems with a burning smell . I am sticking with Waring products .

55056,3,"Great pan for a couple of people I love this pan . As for cooking : This pan does a great job on steaks , burgers , chicken , whatever . Leaves really nice grill marks . The only thing you will need to do is have a cover or splatter shield for it . I use a 16 "" round cover from a much bigger pan just to avoid some of the little drops of grease spattering out on my range . This seems to work just find for me . As for Cleaning : I let it cool a little after cooking and pour some water ( no soap ! ) into the bottom of the pan while it is just hot enough for the water to boil a little , and using a wooden spatula ( only use wood in this pan ) , I scrape all the fond away ( burnt tasty bits stuck to the pan ) and pour into the sink . I repeat this once or twice and put the pan back on the heat and wipe it down with a paper towel . I then use some supermarket brand canola oil spray and lightly coat the inside while the pan is still warm . Takes about 2 minutes to do this . I store this pan in my oven since it tends to have a light coat of oil on it all the time . This pan is so well worth the hand cleaning to have especially since I live in an apartment and do n't have access to a grill",269,1,0.00035087719298248214,0.21518676791599162,0.00035087719298248214,0.00035087719298248214,0.06268852294191926,0.00035087719298248214,0.018057679715934003,0.00035087719298248214,0.01781958504459234,0.00035087719298248214,0.05055438289607411,0.00035087719298248214,0.00035087719298248214,0.00035087719298248214,0.00035087719298248214,0.00035087719298248214,0.07598064703186114,0.00035087719298248214,0.01789473684210562,0.00035087719298248214,0.00035087719298248214,0.00035087719298248214,0.00035087719298248214,0.00035087719298248214,0.00035087719298248214,0.021461830515077978,0.00035087719298248214,0.00035087719298248214,0.01887935961131832,0.018388254846054407,0.00035087719298248214,0.00035087719298248214,0.00035087719298248214,0.00035087719298248214,0.00035087719298248214,0.00035087719298248214,0.00035087719298248214,0.00035087719298248214,0.00035087719298248214,0.05784908216725887,0.00035087719298248214,0.00035087719298248214,0.06525400788090405,0.00035087719298248214,0.00035087719298248214,0.00035087719298248214,0.34700268645055643,0.00035087719298248214,0.00035087719298248214,0.00035087719298248214,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

I have had mine going on 5 years now , not a problem with it . great value , good gift for cooks for one or two , who do not need a huge unit to chop stuff .",105,1,0.0008000000000000326,0.0008000000000000326,0.0008000000000000326,0.0008000000000000326,0.09525836814988103,0.04097840501999979,0.0008000000000000326,0.0008000000000000326,0.0008000000000000326,0.0008000000000000326,0.07367876389730255,0.0008000000000000326,0.0008000000000000326,0.0008000000000000326,0.0008000000000000326,0.0008000000000000326,0.15000647637773798,0.0008000000000000326,0.0008000000000000326,0.0008000000000000326,0.0008000000000000326,0.0008000000000000326,0.1876241442997158,0.0008000000000000326,0.0008000000000000326,0.0008000000000000326,0.0008000000000000326,0.0008000000000000326,0.0008000000000000326,0.0008000000000000326,0.0008000000000000326,0.0008000000000000326,0.0008000000000000326,0.0008000000000000326,0.1637172198949773,0.0008000000000000326,0.0008000000000000326,0.0008000000000000326,0.0008000000000000326,0.0008000000000000326,0.042252211871745396,0.07772611992827651,0.0008000000000000326,0.0008000000000000326,0.1359582905603624,0.0008000000000000326,0.0008000000000000326,0.0008000000000000326,0.0008000000000000326,0.0008000000000000326,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0
55067,3,Kicks butt at picking up dog fur .. Heads and tails above my 8 year old Hoover wind - tunnel bagged unit . Never did understand the 8 bucks for 3 bags . Hoover should have given the vacuum away due to always having to replace bags every week ( adds up to big bucks quickly).The Dyson kicks butt ... Three times the dirt is picked up every week when compared to Hoover bag replacement size of dirt removed . Wish the Dyson had self propelled system ... The house keeper would n't be so tired after 3 hours ; o ) Handy hose and a really well thought out system . Hands down the best unit I 've ever owned . Time will tell if it holds up like the hoover unit did . Wo n't miss the belt replacements ( 2 ) or the bag cost on the Hoover . Would I buy another ? If it holds up like my Hoover did ... You bet ...

I managed to get most of it off , but a thin layer remains . I figure that "" Goof - Off "" or some other solvent would get rid of it , but I do n't want to put poison on something that 'll be holding my food .

55199,3,"A great set at an even greater price I 've used this set for several years now and have been very pleased with the overall cutting ability of these knives . Even though I also own Global and Shun kitchen knives , I find myself being drawn to the Insignia knives when I am in a hurry or in the middle of a large project . Although both the Global and the Shun have sharper edges , their price difference does n't equate directly to the increased level of sharpness that you get . That is to say , yes Global and Shun knives are sharper , but they are not three to four hundred percent sharper all though their price difference certainly would suggest that . Using my Insignia knives , I am able to quickly dice , cut , and slice through onions , carrots , chicken , roasts , etc . That said , there are several cavets that need to be stated . First , do n't wash these knives in a dishwasher . It has nothing to do with the quality of the steel . I would n't wash my Ken Onion Shun Chef 's knife in the dishwasher and that one knife costs as much as two whole sets of the Insignia . Second , these knives need to be honed regularly . A few strokes after every use makes a real difference . Third , after owning the knives for almost two years , I sharpened each of the knives on oil stones . These knives , like all knives will need to be resharpened from time to time . The good news is that they resharpened quite nicely , a tribute to their quality . Since resharpening , they have continued to hold their edges . Last , the balance of these knives is more than adequate . I also own the matching sanduko and have found it to be the best of the series . All though I am a bit of a knife snob , and although I would love to purchase a block set of either the Shun or the Globals , I ca n't justify it given that the Insignia 's cut so well . My wife would really give me no end of grief if I threw out a perfectly good set of knives . And a good set of knives these are",406,1,0.2259109898627978,0.244770339625172,0.07005260147006451,0.00035714285714288446,0.026219956209199508,0.00035714285714288446,0.00035714285714288446,0.00035714285714288446,0.00035714285714288446,0.00035714285714288446,0.00035714285714288446,0.00035714285714288446,0.00035714285714288446,0.00035714285714288446,0.00035714285714288446,0.00035714285714288446,0.00035714285714288446,0.00035714285714288446,0.00035714285714288446,0.020262909398222513,0.00035714285714288446,0.00035714285714288446,0.00035714285714288446,0.021143528667773522,0.00035714285714288446,0.13601135598111594,0.00035714285714288446,0.00035714285714288446,0.00035714285714288446,0.00035714285714288446,0.00035714285714288446,0.00035714285714288446,0.00035714285714288446,0.00035714285714288446,0.00035714285714288446,0.00035714285714288446,0.00035714285714288446,0.00035714285714288446,0.00035714285714288446,0.00035714285714288446,0.15419145926750305,0.00035714285714288446,0.022878562738234572,0.00035714285714288446,0.00035714285714288446,0.00035714285714288446,0.06427258249420119,0.00035714285714288446,0.00035714285714288446,0.00035714285714288446,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

55226,3,"My own tea butler ! This machine is really a great invention - especially for those of us who have a tendency to spend on good tea and then screw up some part of the process that falls between the brewing and the first sip ( for example , infusing the tea for too long ) . I think my tea will have more of a fighting chance with this new machine . The design is great - quite classy , and I think it will be great for entertaining ( loved the way the tray that holds the machine could suddenly be converted into a serving tray for the well - designed tea pot and cups ) . Here is how it worked for me : You pour your loose tea in the infuser basket , fill the tank with water , select the strength of your beverage and turn it on . There 's even a chance to choose which kind of tea you are brewing for optimal results ( for example oolong or green ) . This nifty little machine will do the rest . It will even pour the tea in the tea pot ! I 'm finally enjoying my fine tea without the stress .

55228,3,"nearly perfect This tea pot , like their French - Press coffee pot , is made of ` magic glass ' - it does n't seem to break . I 'm hard on things and usually need heavy - duty models just for every day survival . I 've had this tea pot for - maybe 8 years - unheard of for things around me . The glass just does n't seem to break . Others have spoken about how you use it to make tea - a brilliant idea . But here 's the other cool thing : when you get a ` presentation ' tea like say a ` peony ' tea that opens into a flower or say , a sea - shell tea like peets.com sells that opens up into an oyster looking shell with a string of jasmine flowers as ` pearls ' floating above it - you can SEE the magic unfold and enjoy the beauty and art of the tea unfolding if you leave the infuser out and just let the folded tea do what ever it does . The ONLY down side is that the cap wo n't fit on the tea pot if you take the infuser out . But I have never found that to be a problem . The tea MAY cool a bit faster - but not so much so that it bothers me . The fact that it is glass and has outlasted so many hand thrown ceramic tea pots I 've had speaks to it 's wonder and durability . Like I said , this is made of magic glass .",275,1,0.25090709746264994,0.16353953456253803,0.0004545454545454886,0.0004545454545454886,0.0004545454545454886,0.0004545454545454886,0.04928373205951078,0.0004545454545454886,0.0004545454545454886,0.0004545454545454886,0.0004545454545454886,0.0004545454545454886,0.4173298974533025,0.0004545454545454886,0.0004545454545454886,0.0004545454545454886,0.0004545454545454886,0.0004545454545454886,0.0004545454545454886,0.0004545454545454886,0.0004545454545454886,0.0004545454545454886,0.0004545454545454886,0.01878081900604914,0.0004545454545454886,0.0004545454545454886,0.0004545454545454886,0.0004545454545454886,0.0004545454545454886,0.0004545454545454886,0.0004545454545454886,0.0004545454545454886,0.0004545454545454886,0.0004545454545454886,0.0004545454545454886,0.0004545454545454886,0.0004545454545454886,0.0004545454545454886,0.0004545454545454886,0.0004545454545454886,0.05090301506110051,0.0004545454545454886,0.0004545454545454886,0.0004545454545454886,0.0004545454545454886,0.0004545454545454886,0.029710449849393125,0.0004545454545454886,0.0004545454545454886,0.0004545454545454886,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

You can give this measuring cup set and hold your head up , knowing you gave something that wo n't be sneered at or find its way to the return pile by the blushing bride . Everyone needs these cups to do cooking , from the large size for soup and broth to the small size for baking . And I will confess , I 've used the medium sized one as an emergency gravy boat . So it does n't look quite as nice as a cut glass gravy server -- it works JUST fine .

The one thing that is a negative is the legs do not fold down completely for storage but everything else folds down(table top and the small bar.other than the legs not folding this is a five star,101,1,0.0012500000000001032,0.14335353240778845,0.0012500000000001032,0.0012500000000001032,0.0012500000000001032,0.0012500000000001032,0.0012500000000001032,0.0012500000000001032,0.0012500000000001032,0.0012500000000001032,0.0012500000000001032,0.0012500000000001032,0.0012500000000001032,0.0012500000000001032,0.0012500000000001032,0.0012500000000001032,0.0012500000000001032,0.0012500000000001032,0.12620748872840817,0.0637500000000032,0.0012500000000001032,0.0012500000000001032,0.0012500000000001032,0.0012500000000001032,0.17903862768532833,0.0012500000000001032,0.1310543578149531,0.0012500000000001032,0.0012500000000001032,0.0012500000000001032,0.0012500000000001032,0.0012500000000001032,0.30159599336351434,0.0012500000000001032,0.0012500000000001032,0.0012500000000001032,0.0012500000000001032,0.0012500000000001032,0.0012500000000001032,0.0012500000000001032,0.0012500000000001032,0.0012500000000001032,0.0012500000000001032,0.0012500000000001032,0.0012500000000001032,0.0012500000000001032,0.0012500000000001032,0.0012500000000001032,0.0012500000000001032,0.0012500000000001032,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1

55282,3,"Good Enough - and then some Purchased these to go with a 7 inch Henckels International santoku that I 've been using for years , and the phrase that comes to mind to describe all Fine Edge cutlery is "" good enough . "" No , it is n't restaurant quality , and yes , if you put these through the dishwasher they 'll tarnish and probably even start to rust ( any metal designated as "" stainless "" is rust resistant rather than rust proof , and reviewers of other Henckels products complaining about rust and tarnish probably are n't treating their knives very well ) . As a graduate student on a budget who enjoys cooking , but does n't always have the time for it , these knives are an ideal compromise between price and quality . Be aware that they will occasionally require sharpening - I 've had the santoku for almost three years and run it through a commercially available ceramic disk sharpener every few months and it still cuts very nicely - and should probably be hand - washed for longest life . With that little bit of maintenance , however , this three piece set can meet nearly all of your cooking needs ( it meets all of mine , but then I do n't often dress poultry , filet my own fish , or do much that would require a cleaver or really subtle boning knife ) for quite a nice price",250,1,0.1464410452622656,0.18112545462256352,0.06855007293099226,0.0005000000000000368,0.0005000000000000368,0.0005000000000000368,0.0005000000000000368,0.0005000000000000368,0.0005000000000000368,0.0005000000000000368,0.0005000000000000368,0.0005000000000000368,0.0005000000000000368,0.0005000000000000368,0.02473136307657912,0.0005000000000000368,0.07921902240387028,0.0005000000000000368,0.0005000000000000368,0.0005000000000000368,0.0005000000000000368,0.0005000000000000368,0.07641128566235025,0.0005000000000000368,0.0005000000000000368,0.031782511888238864,0.0005000000000000368,0.0005000000000000368,0.0005000000000000368,0.0005000000000000368,0.0005000000000000368,0.0005000000000000368,0.0005000000000000368,0.0005000000000000368,0.0005000000000000368,0.0005000000000000368,0.0005000000000000368,0.0005000000000000368,0.03949090143794122,0.0005000000000000368,0.2837487892404057,0.0005000000000000368,0.048499553474791554,0.0005000000000000368,0.0005000000000000368,0.0005000000000000368,0.0005000000000000368,0.0005000000000000368,0.0005000000000000368,0.0005000000000000368,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
55283,3,"Totally Worth It ! After reading all the reviews and hearing about this on the radio , I went ahead and shelled out $ 100 for this . I had really high expectation , having never spent so much for a heater before . I have happy to say that I am completely satisfied . This heater does n't overwhelm and dry out the room with too much heat . Instead it circulates the heat over time ( you should probably give it a good half hour to properly heat the whole room ) evenly heating the whole room and leaving absolutely no cold spots . After spending some time in my room , I had completely forgotten how cold it was outside . Other bonuses are that it is very easy to operate and has a thermostat so you can set it to the exact termerature that you want your room to be . My only minor complaint is that for its price , it should have included a remote control .

55289,3,"THE cookware for serious home cooks My fiance and I registered for this set and we were thrilled when my parents got it for us . I have been an avid home cook for over 10 years and have never had a complete set of cookware . This is exactly what the Dr. ordered ! Here 's why:1 ) Heavy , sturdy construction . These things can take a beating . They heat evenly and hold heat very well.2 ) You can use metal utensils with them . I hate plastic spatulas ! We all know that we are n't supposed to use metal with non - stick pans but we all do and then after a while our pan is a useless , peeling shadow of its former self . Well this is n't the case with Calphalon 1 ! Scrape away with any device you have at your disposal with no fear . 3 ) They "" stick "" and sear as well as cast iron cookware ( it 's a good thing ) . This is the best feature for me . Coated non - stick cookware has its place but if you like to pan sear and get those tasty browned bits for sauces you used to have to use a pan that 's not non - stick such as stainless steel or cast iron . They "" stick "" for a reason . You need that contact with the cooking surface to get that great browning . Now there 's the Calphalon 1 which sears as well as cast iron pans but cleans up like a non - stick pan . It 's a no - brainer ! 4 ) They look cool , have great handles , they 're oven - safe , and they come with a lifetime warranty . These are not cheap . If your primary goal in cookware is super easy cleanup then do n't buy this expensive set . It will dissapoint you . But , if you want the advantages of traditional cookware combined with easier cleanup in a durable , functional set , and are willing to shell out the $ $ $ for a top - of - the - line product then this is for you . Serious cooks who need the correct tools will love this cookware",393,1,0.0002898550724637963,0.1394674202821871,0.0002898550724637963,0.018211508359017976,0.0245257170499902,0.0002898550724637963,0.015108321671342342,0.02006345861302772,0.0002898550724637963,0.0002898550724637963,0.019276105740478923,0.0002898550724637963,0.0002898550724637963,0.0002898550724637963,0.0002898550724637963,0.0002898550724637963,0.0002898550724637963,0.020483547503820188,0.0002898550724637963,0.0002898550724637963,0.0002898550724637963,0.0002898550724637963,0.0002898550724637963,0.0002898550724637963,0.0002898550724637963,0.07490519521390332,0.12180175133596059,0.0002898550724637963,0.0002898550724637963,0.0738070286314757,0.0002898550724637963,0.0002898550724637963,0.0002898550724637963,0.0002898550724637963,0.0002898550724637963,0.0002898550724637963,0.0002898550724637963,0.0002898550724637963,0.0002898550724637963,0.045242733570027255,0.02354761157831709,0.0002898550724637963,0.0002898550724637963,0.0002898550724637963,0.23352741494718313,0.0002898550724637963,0.1595974028945721,0.0002898550724637963,0.0002898550724637963,0.0002898550724637963,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0

When I do , some folks look at me like I 'm nuts while others instantly begin grinning and nodding their heads . ( Kindred spirits!)Here 's the deal . I hate bending over . I hate getting my hands dirty with a dustpan . I do n't mind sweeping a room , but for some reason that extra stepof scooping up the pile of dirt and dumping it into the trash can drives me crazy .

I love it!I do n't have to empty the canister very often , maybe once a month at most . The only drawback is that it 's pretty loud and my family gets mad at me ifI do n't warn them that I 'm about to kick it on . But as long as I say "" Sweep - Eze alert ! "" , they 're happy .

55352,3,"My favorite salad spinner This is my favorite salad spinner , and I 've tried several over the last couple years . It dries my lettuce very well , and has some useful features that I have n't seen in other spinners . Like the old Zyliss spinner , you pull on a handle to spin the basket . But with this one the more you pull , the faster it spins , kind of like revving up a top or something . It spins much faster than those ' crank ' spinners or the ' push down ' type -and faster spinning means more water off your veggies . As for the new features , here are my top five : 1 ) The lid is clear , so you can see the veggies spinning around in there and make sure you 're not overfilling the spinner , the lettuce is nt bunching up in one corner , etc . OK , it 's also just mesmerizing to watch your food spin round and round . Kind of like watching your clothes roll around in the dryer.2 ) There is a brake ! So after you 've whipped your veggies into a frenzy , you can slam them to a stop -which also helps get more water off . This works better on the small sized spinner , since there is less weight to stop , but even on the big spinner it works very well . I have seen a brake on another spinner , but this one works much better.3 ) The cord pulls itself back in -and gently : I disliked how the old ' string ' spinners would yank on your arm , and if you did n't respond just right the string would n't pull in at all : it ends up just sitting there in a pile . You 'd have to take the lid off and wind it up yourself ! This new design winds the cord up every time.4 ) The basket is smooth on the inside -that 's something I defintely have not seen before . It 's a subtle feature , but very helpful : it helps make sure little bits of your lettuce do nt get stuck in the basket when you 're cleaning it out.5 ) You can stack things on top of it , both in the fridge and in the cupboard , because the top is mostly flat . The handle even sits in its own little pocket in the lid so that it 's not in the way . In my house fridge space is valuable and I appreciate being able to stack this spinner like I do with my tupperware . So , overall I am impressed with this spinner ( so impressed that I 've also given it as a gift ! ) .

55397,3,"I love this pan I Love this pan and Size . I was n't going to buy this pan at first , cause it was the "" Simply "" , But I 'm not sorry at all ... I have alot of Calphalon Commercial ( at least 20 ) , and yes it 's thicker , But I think this cooks very well . Being that this is abit lighter , I find when its filled up , its heavy enough for me , and easyier to handle . The price is also alot less then the Calphalon Commercial . Since you most likely would not use this pan everyday , I would think you would not need a lifetime warentee like the Commercial gives you , if you use it the right way . I have sauted hamburger meat , onions , peppers ect . emptyed the fat off , added sauses , and continued cooking everything together , then puting this into the oven to finish it off .. Never a problem . I have used this for making Large Egg Omelets , the cheese has never stuck . Use it for fryed potatoes with low fat cheese , and I do n't need to use alot of oil , The nonstick works fine . I have used this for sauteing Pasta with sauses .. This is a large size , so you can put alot into this and have left overs . You can make pancakes , frenched toast , I would think anything you want .. I guess what I 'm saying is , you can use this size for anything . I do have the Calphalon Commercial double gridle , but if you do n't have room for all the peices that I have , this can cover alot . I have found this to cook even , and you do n't need to turn your stove on high . This lid seems to fit fine , and its a bit domed . I do n't have a problem with it . The sides are stright up , and seems high enough . Lots of flat space in the bottom . Mine is also made in Ohio , not Japan , but you never know with some peices of Calphalon lately ! ! This washes very easy . Never put any Calphalon into the dishwasher , altho this lid you could put into the dishwasher ( I do n't tho ) I would buy this again ... I only paid $ 42.00 for this , so I did buy two of them , one for a gift . I do n't understand Amazon 's priceing , as sometimes the Calphalon Commercial can be less money!!So I would say , take the time and check out your other options , as the Calphalon Commercial has more layers of nonstick and is a higher quality , but do n't let that scare you off from buying this one",501,1,0.19588260422887638,0.18467222988740015,0.031281970003226994,0.0002739726027397497,0.030564542713945334,0.0002739726027397497,0.0002739726027397497,0.0002739726027397497,0.0002739726027397497,0.0002739726027397497,0.01562829870537163,0.0002739726027397497,0.0002739726027397497,0.0002739726027397497,0.013972602739725042,0.0002739726027397497,0.038941902617309905,0.09402667522956136,0.01397260273972539,0.0002739726027397497,0.0002739726027397497,0.0002739726027397497,0.034780022609188055,0.0002739726027397497,0.0002739726027397497,0.04364210167026637,0.0002739726027397497,0.0002739726027397497,0.0002739726027397497,0.0002739726027397497,0.0002739726027397497,0.0002739726027397497,0.03130746409584695,0.0002739726027397497,0.0002739726027397497,0.0002739726027397497,0.0002739726027397497,0.0002739726027397497,0.04501238952586063,0.03937231752003811,0.0002739726027397497,0.0002739726027397497,0.0002739726027397497,0.0002739726027397497,0.0002739726027397497,0.0002739726027397497,0.1773532346177666,0.0002739726027397497,0.0002739726027397497,0.0002739726027397497,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

55426,3,"Nice Set , BUT .... I had bought the larger set in BLUE and ordered these pans in BLUE as well . Thinking that they would match the pieces I already owned , I was quite disappointed when I received BLACK instead of the BLUE I ordered . I returned them and Amazon replaced them with another set of BLACK pans . I decided to keep them but am quite upset , with my only alternative being to return them for credit . Keep in mind that these are NOT the heavy Stainless Steel , but the lighter weight ALUMINUM . You will NOT be able to mistreatthese pans by turning the flame up on full . To do so will causethe pans to warp . The advantage to these pans is that they are LIGHTWEIGHT and easyto handle . I definitely recommend them . As with all TEFLON coated pans , be sure to use the PLASTICutensils and NEVER use any metal spoons or turners or you willruin the Teflon surface . With a little care these will last foryears!TIP : If you 're having trouble with the bottom of your pots andpans getting a scorched or burnt look , it 's from GREASE . Whenyou wash your pans , make sure all the grease is cleaned off ofthe outside bottom of the pans",225,1,0.139873412791391,0.21890175174727186,0.0006060606060606546,0.0006060606060606546,0.0006060606060606546,0.0006060606060606546,0.0006060606060606546,0.0006060606060606546,0.0006060606060606546,0.0006060606060606546,0.0006060606060606546,0.06399528108653675,0.1015164354989929,0.0006060606060606546,0.0006060606060606546,0.0006060606060606546,0.03805086601335766,0.1597730892570455,0.0006060606060606546,0.0006060606060606546,0.0006060606060606546,0.0006060606060606546,0.0006060606060606546,0.0006060606060606546,0.0006060606060606546,0.09450100507881826,0.0006060606060606546,0.0006060606060606546,0.0006060606060606546,0.0006060606060606546,0.0006060606060606546,0.0006060606060606546,0.0006060606060606546,0.0006060606060606546,0.0006060606060606546,0.0785183325763269,0.0006060606060606546,0.0006060606060606546,0.0006060606060606546,0.0006060606060606546,0.0006060606060606546,0.0006060606060606546,0.0006060606060606546,0.0006060606060606546,0.0006060606060606546,0.0006060606060606546,0.0800213411017723,0.0006060606060606546,0.0006060606060606546,0.0006060606060606546,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
55454,3,"My Guilty Pleasure ! I am so in love with my new machine . Many thanks to all the reviewers who made my long search for the perfect espresso machine become a reality . I received my machine really quickly and that 's saying something for someone who loves immediate gratification . Speaking of gratification , I could not be happier with my choice of an automatic espresso machine . All the reviews are true . It 's perfect , once you read the instructions or perhaps do as I did , get a walk - thru from the wonderful folks at DeLonghi customer support , you will be up and running in no time . You can see that the machine is solidly constructed and with proper care ( read the instructions ) will last a very long time . The espressos I 've made so far are supreme , even my 14 year old loved a weak one I made for him ; and it 's so easy after set - up to use . It could not be any simpler . Who would not love this machine ? There was one website that was charging $ 1200 for the same machine . I could not believe my eyes . The only review that troubled me was the one who said the frother was somehow not adequate due to it not swinging far enough away from the machine . I really could not see what he was talking about . It has plenty of room for any size cup but you have to remember if you are into the foam ( it makes very creamy foam ) it will increase the volume 2 - 3 times so you need a large enough container to froth the milk . But there was no awkwardness or problem at all with using the frother . They had me worried when I read that but the frother does its thing with total ease . Even a caveman could do it . You stick it in the milk and turn the switch and , voila ! , it 's frothed and container size is only an issue if you are trying to froth in something too small and ca n't accomodate the foam it creates .

55460,3,"My favorite mixing bowl This is a very comfortable bowl to use . Made of sturdy plastic , it is much lighter than glass mixing bowls , which makes it convenient and easy to use . The handle is very ergonomic and comfortable to grip ( really good when pouring batter into a pan , for instance ) , and the shape of the bowl itself is perfect for wrapping an arm around for those heavy duty mixing sessions . The rubber on the bottom keeps the bowl right where you put it - no sliding . I use this bowl the most of all my mixing bowls and am looking forward to getting a bigger one just like it .

55478,3,"The Best Carpet Cleaner I have Ever Used I wanted to say that this is the Best Cleaner out there as far as I m concerned . Very Easy to Assemble , and Use . Our carpet came out looking like new , all the stains that I have been trying to get out came out with no problem at all . We bought a model home for custom built homes and there was alot of heavy traffic ( foot ) in the house not to mention we have pets in the house . I used the cleaner all through the house ( 2200 sq ft ) . It was amaing how this cleaner got everything thing clean . There was a large bad stain area due to a plate of hot food was dropped and all the oils from the cooking and butter was dumped on the carpet . I tried everything to remove it , nothing would get the stains out . When I used this Steam Cleaner on it , Guess What all the stains had been removed . I really do think it has something to do with the brush action and the fact that it heats up the water , plus it also gives out equal amount of soap and water . I would also add that I have used this on our furniture and it worked just as good as it did one the carpet I have recommended this machine to all my friends , it is worth the money Plus . I also have a small Steam Cleaner from the same company it is perfect for the Rec Room and pet accidents on the carpet",282,1,0.028773535558594895,0.14483734493420045,0.0003389830508474846,0.022261415216233333,0.024008420583881144,0.0003389830508474846,0.0003389830508474846,0.0003389830508474846,0.0003389830508474846,0.0003389830508474846,0.0003389830508474846,0.02685015265529661,0.19587749525022588,0.0003389830508474846,0.0003389830508474846,0.0003389830508474846,0.0003389830508474846,0.0003389830508474846,0.0003389830508474846,0.06050549879621827,0.0003389830508474846,0.0003389830508474846,0.028840237687515466,0.0003389830508474846,0.0003389830508474846,0.0003389830508474846,0.0003389830508474846,0.0003389830508474846,0.0003389830508474846,0.0003389830508474846,0.0003389830508474846,0.0003389830508474846,0.165499253344321,0.0003389830508474846,0.0003389830508474846,0.0003389830508474846,0.0003389830508474846,0.0003389830508474846,0.0003389830508474846,0.06985165363564942,0.0003389830508474846,0.0003389830508474846,0.09067757701813232,0.0003389830508474846,0.0003389830508474846,0.018436234374464143,0.1110388080639101,0.0003389830508474846,0.0003389830508474846,0.0003389830508474846,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0

55492,3,"Nice and Roomy ! This steamer fits perfectly on Cuisinart 's 4 Qt saucepan . The lid seals in every bit of steam . I used to always have to add more water when steaming batches of corn - on - the - cob , but since no steam escapes here , I can make several batches non - stop . I also like the fact that the steamer is wide ; that means that the food will cook evenly ( instead of other steamers where the stuff at the bottom gets overcooked and the stuff at the very top gets undercooked ) . I 've only used the steamer five or six times but so far , there 's practically no sign of dullness or staining - maybe just a little sign of dullness , but I 'm more interested in function than appearance . Washing it immediately will keep it stain - free .

I like the way it can take four big pieces of bread or bagels without taking up too much room in the kitchen . 5 stars",117,1,0.0007692307692308014,0.20271712872256742,0.0007692307692308014,0.0007692307692308014,0.0007692307692308014,0.0007692307692308014,0.0007692307692308014,0.0007692307692308014,0.0007692307692308014,0.0007692307692308014,0.0007692307692308014,0.0007692307692308014,0.0007692307692308014,0.0007692307692308014,0.0007692307692308014,0.0007692307692308014,0.0007692307692308014,0.0007692307692308014,0.0007692307692308014,0.19284072154471546,0.0007692307692308014,0.2588717512864089,0.0007692307692308014,0.0007692307692308014,0.0007692307692308014,0.0007692307692308014,0.0007692307692308014,0.0007692307692308014,0.0007692307692308014,0.14448892001116348,0.0007692307692308014,0.0007692307692308014,0.16646609381975888,0.0007692307692308014,0.0007692307692308014,0.0007692307692308014,0.0007692307692308014,0.0007692307692308014,0.0007692307692308014,0.0007692307692308014,0.0007692307692308014,0.0007692307692308014,0.0007692307692308014,0.0007692307692308014,0.0007692307692308014,0.0007692307692308014,0.0007692307692308014,0.0007692307692308014,0.0007692307692308014,0.0007692307692308014,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

We got two different Roshco silicon pans , and it does seem that baking times and temps may need to be slightly adjusted and is probably what let to some of the complaints people have listed",92,1,0.0009523809523809888,0.0009523809523809888,0.0009523809523809888,0.0009523809523809888,0.16193017445014127,0.0009523809523809888,0.0009523809523809888,0.0009523809523809888,0.0009523809523809888,0.0009523809523809888,0.0009523809523809888,0.0009523809523809888,0.4329126626708086,0.0009523809523809888,0.0009523809523809888,0.0009523809523809888,0.0009523809523809888,0.0009523809523809888,0.0009523809523809888,0.0009523809523809888,0.0009523809523809888,0.0009523809523809888,0.0009523809523809888,0.0009523809523809888,0.0009523809523809888,0.0009523809523809888,0.0009523809523809888,0.0009523809523809888,0.0009523809523809888,0.0009523809523809888,0.0009523809523809888,0.0009523809523809888,0.0009523809523809888,0.0009523809523809888,0.0009523809523809888,0.0009523809523809888,0.0009523809523809888,0.0009523809523809888,0.0009523809523809888,0.07595827134920961,0.0009523809523809888,0.0009523809523809888,0.0009523809523809888,0.0009523809523809888,0.0009523809523809888,0.0009523809523809888,0.28538936772031515,0.0009523809523809888,0.0009523809523809888,0.0009523809523809888,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1
55596,3,"23 reviews so far , and all 5 stars ! This is a great product ! I 'm a single 47 year old guy . I 'm not a great cook . I 've lost 25 # ( am now down to 168 ) and am trying to eat better . This makes it easy ! No more nuking junk food , or frying food covered in fat , just steam it . No more worries about burning things ( the smoke detector used to be my warning that dinner was done ) . I bought the Oster 5712 last week . I 've cooked boiled eggs , frozen chicken breast , Contessa stir fry frozen oriental dinners and frozen fish in it so far . It rocks ! Tonight I 'm going to cook diced chicken breast and wild rice with seasonings in it and I 'm 99.9 % sure it will turn out great even though I 've never tried it before . This baby makes cooking easy . Cleaning it is also easy . No burnt food on it , just hot water . For cleaning it 's almost like is has already been soaking in hot dishwater . Just a bit of soap and spray it off . As far as price vs functionality this thing is a steal ! - Jo",226,1,0.1977074188623452,0.02611441332655945,0.0004255319148936496,0.026997053211893694,0.10107831009177236,0.0004255319148936496,0.0004255319148936496,0.0004255319148936496,0.0004255319148936496,0.0004255319148936496,0.025567738218820635,0.0004255319148936496,0.25647331346414637,0.0004255319148936496,0.0004255319148936496,0.0004255319148936496,0.03631474238948248,0.0004255319148936496,0.0004255319148936496,0.0004255319148936496,0.0004255319148936496,0.0004255319148936496,0.0004255319148936496,0.027481467359203742,0.0004255319148936496,0.0004255319148936496,0.0004255319148936496,0.0004255319148936496,0.0004255319148936496,0.0004255319148936496,0.0004255319148936496,0.0004255319148936496,0.09933909745491805,0.0004255319148936496,0.0004255319148936496,0.0004255319148936496,0.0004255319148936496,0.0004255319148936496,0.0004255319148936496,0.0004255319148936496,0.0004255319148936496,0.0004255319148936496,0.08230873028406029,0.0004255319148936496,0.0004255319148936496,0.0004255319148936496,0.10402197065594532,0.0004255319148936496,0.0004255319148936496,0.0004255319148936496,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

55665,3,"Great , but buy elsewhere The KitchenAid Professional 5 Plus ( KV25G0X ) is a great product , but you should buy it elsewhere . We ordered it from Amazon , and got the Commercial ( KM25G0X ) instead . We did not want that , so contacted customer service . They said they 'd exchange it , but they sent us another KM25G0X. No good , obviously . Then , the customer service representative claimed they could not reliably get in touch with the warehouse , so they had no idea whether they ever actually would get the item they advertise . They said they sometimes substituted similar products . Great .

They were much cheaper than trays marketed specifically for freezing baby food",90,1,0.2560467348326546,0.0011111111111111592,0.056666666673247865,0.0011111111111111592,0.06273621165891796,0.0011111111111111592,0.0011111111111111592,0.0011111111111111592,0.0011111111111111592,0.0011111111111111592,0.0011111111111111592,0.0011111111111111592,0.0011111111111111592,0.0011111111111111592,0.0011111111111111592,0.0011111111111111592,0.0011111111111111592,0.0011111111111111592,0.0011111111111111592,0.0011111111111111592,0.0011111111111111592,0.0011111111111111592,0.0011111111111111592,0.0011111111111111592,0.0011111111111111592,0.0011111111111111592,0.0011111111111111592,0.0011111111111111592,0.0011111111111111592,0.0011111111111111592,0.0011111111111111592,0.0011111111111111592,0.0011111111111111592,0.0011111111111111592,0.0011111111111111592,0.0011111111111111592,0.0011111111111111592,0.0011111111111111592,0.0011111111111111592,0.0011111111111111592,0.0011111111111111592,0.0011111111111111592,0.0011111111111111592,0.0011111111111111592,0.3433377862410925,0.05658932874869877,0.17573438295649743,0.0011111111111111592,0.0011111111111111592,0.0011111111111111592,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1

I am so glad to get something that is sturdy and large now we will have a place to put our clothes .,74,1,0.0016666666666667837,0.3450979737513905,0.0016666666666667837,0.0016666666666667837,0.3899832196427617,0.0016666666666667837,0.0016666666666667837,0.0016666666666667837,0.0016666666666667837,0.0016666666666667837,0.0016666666666667837,0.0016666666666667837,0.0016666666666667837,0.0016666666666667837,0.08499999999134732,0.0016666666666667837,0.0016666666666667837,0.0016666666666667837,0.0016666666666667837,0.0016666666666667837,0.0016666666666667837,0.0016666666666667837,0.0016666666666667837,0.0016666666666667837,0.0016666666666667837,0.0016666666666667837,0.0016666666666667837,0.0016666666666667837,0.0016666666666667837,0.0016666666666667837,0.0016666666666667837,0.0016666666666667837,0.10325213994782871,0.0016666666666667837,0.0016666666666667837,0.0016666666666667837,0.0016666666666667837,0.0016666666666667837,0.0016666666666667837,0.0016666666666667837,0.0016666666666667837,0.0016666666666667837,0.0016666666666667837,0.0016666666666667837,0.0016666666666667837,0.0016666666666667837,0.0016666666666667837,0.0016666666666667837,0.0016666666666667837,0.0016666666666667837,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
55802,3,"Muffins comes right out I used metal muffin pans before , the muffins will never come out without the help of a knife , even the pan was sprayed . On the other side , I am very satisfied with the Kitchenaid product , becuase beautiful muffins come right out , when turn the pan unside down ( need to apply cooking spray before baking ) . Yes , it did have some plastic smell during baking for the first couple times . After that , no smell at all . I chose not to pay $ 5 extra for the rack , still it works well with a cookie tray . The only negative comment is the unerasble marks left by grease(oil / cooking spray ) on the surface . I am not complaining about it , as it states clearly in the instructions , and it does not affect baking . Overall , I am very satisfied with this product , and I will buy more for my new kitchen .",173,1,0.08824753176342663,0.4090958440293921,0.000645161290322637,0.000645161290322637,0.000645161290322637,0.000645161290322637,0.000645161290322637,0.000645161290322637,0.024902954059130948,0.000645161290322637,0.0796242664115865,0.000645161290322637,0.000645161290322637,0.000645161290322637,0.000645161290322637,0.000645161290322637,0.000645161290322637,0.08071983656211257,0.000645161290322637,0.06881574683191907,0.000645161290322637,0.000645161290322637,0.000645161290322637,0.000645161290322637,0.000645161290322637,0.000645161290322637,0.000645161290322637,0.000645161290322637,0.000645161290322637,0.0332315030058049,0.000645161290322637,0.000645161290322637,0.000645161290322637,0.000645161290322637,0.000645161290322637,0.000645161290322637,0.000645161290322637,0.000645161290322637,0.000645161290322637,0.03808694445263957,0.000645161290322637,0.000645161290322637,0.000645161290322637,0.000645161290322637,0.000645161290322637,0.04980142121394205,0.10166750005714012,0.000645161290322637,0.000645161290322637,0.000645161290322637,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0

55858,3,"This is The Best Kitchen Timer Out There In my opinion this is the best kitchen timer out there ! It has FOUR separate programmable digital timers that can count up and/or down - each with their own alarm sound . It also has a regular clock setting . Plus , you can either plop it on the fume hood using the magnet on the back of it , clip it to your apron using the clip or set it on the counter using it 's support stand . Oh , and did I mention how small it is? ... just another nice feature ! So yeah , no more having to set the oven timer , the microwave timer and my watch timer in order to keep track of all the various foods cooking at the same time . Not only do I use this timer in the kitchen constantly I also use it for numerous other things too . It 's the "" Time Out "" timer for the kids , a ten - minute reminder when I need to get us all out of the house ... you name it!My Mother owns this same timer and is the one that originally introduced me to it , thank heavens ! I ca n't imagine running a kitchen without this hard to find item . If you check out Bed , Bath and Beyond you 'll see they do n't have anything with FOUR programmable timers .

55891,3,"Excellent Blade Grinder For the Money :-) I purchased the Cuisinart grinder from Amazon based upon customer reviews just over two years ago after trying two cheaper $ 20-ish models picked up at local discount stores . Motors on one of the cheaper grinders locked up in short order ; the second lasted longer but the blades rusted after only 2 - 3 months in a storage building . The motor on the Cuisinart is still going strong , but I had to trash it today . I have to admit that the blades did seem to be a bit duller after grinding enough beans to make 1 - 3 pots of coffee per day for two years straight , but that 's to be expected with a blade grinder . The on / off button broke about 2 months ago ; then , last week , the blade housing wore out and broke off while grinding my favorite John Conti beans . Others have stated that this grinder is less messy than some of the other models , but grinding coffee is a messy undertaking and a necessary evil to get the freshest coffee ! If I do n't try a higher quality burr grinder , I may get another one of these !",215,1,0.2427370068249226,0.0005263157894737284,0.028333882067805936,0.06524642889275323,0.0005263157894737284,0.0005263157894737284,0.0005263157894737284,0.09795802730889834,0.0005263157894737284,0.0005263157894737284,0.0005263157894737284,0.0005263157894737284,0.0005263157894737284,0.0005263157894737284,0.026842105263157532,0.0005263157894737284,0.0005263157894737284,0.0005263157894737284,0.026842105263158313,0.0005263157894737284,0.0005263157894737284,0.0005263157894737284,0.0005263157894737284,0.03650115366581705,0.0005263157894737284,0.0005263157894737284,0.0005263157894737284,0.0005263157894737284,0.0005263157894737284,0.06485350355963643,0.0005263157894737284,0.0005263157894737284,0.0005263157894737284,0.0005263157894737284,0.0005263157894737284,0.0005263157894737284,0.0005263157894737284,0.0005263157894737284,0.03154955588347994,0.031223592058843522,0.13144756030575205,0.0005263157894737284,0.08335568852853192,0.0005263157894737284,0.11363570616671505,0.0005263157894737284,0.0005263157894737284,0.0005263157894737284,0.0005263157894737284,0.0005263157894737284,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0
55893,3,Read the info This is a decent unit . For those who do n't take the time to read or ca n't understand what they read the product listing states the scoop included is for a 4 ounce cup(4 x 4 is 16 ) . The usual sold in the US coffeemaker is a 4 - 6 ounces per cup capacity . Coffee instructions say usually measures are for a 6 ounce cup . A cup is not what you use or the standard liquid 8 ounce cup . Most advertised 10 and 12 cup coffeemakers hold the same total amount in the carafe . The manufacturer calcultaes what will sell . This has been going on since I bought my first coffeemaker 30 years ago .

55911,3,A good little fan . This little fan does just what I need it for . A bit of air blown right at me sometimes while sitting at my desk . It clips on very well . I even tried it on a 1/2 inch overhang and it stayed on . I would reccomend 3/4 inch if you want to use high setting and oscillation . That oscillation is of no account by the way as the fan just is not that powerful . My reason for no 5 stars is the vibration . There is too much especially on high speed . This could have been solved with more and better padding on the clip . It does n't bother me but might others . The cord is coiled nicely to stay out of the way but has a good stretch . I needed to reverse the blow direction of the fan . This was easily accomplished by removing and replacing only one bolt . All in all very good for my uses . If you need just a bit of air in a tight space this one 's for you,192,1,0.0005555555555555901,0.08383373479789748,0.0005555555555555901,0.0005555555555555901,0.2565846957736148,0.0005555555555555901,0.0005555555555555901,0.0005555555555555901,0.0005555555555555901,0.0005555555555555901,0.0005555555555555901,0.0005555555555555901,0.10758611751543569,0.0005555555555555901,0.0005555555555555901,0.0005555555555555901,0.26438511288895294,0.0005555555555555901,0.0005555555555555901,0.0005555555555555901,0.0005555555555555901,0.0005555555555555901,0.0005555555555555901,0.1398730198028194,0.0005555555555555901,0.07405119624757568,0.0005555555555555901,0.0005555555555555901,0.0005555555555555901,0.0005555555555555901,0.0005555555555555901,0.0005555555555555901,0.0005555555555555901,0.0005555555555555901,0.0005555555555555901,0.0005555555555555901,0.0005555555555555901,0.0005555555555555901,0.0005555555555555901,0.0005555555555555901,0.0005555555555555901,0.0005555555555555901,0.0005555555555555901,0.0005555555555555901,0.0005555555555555901,0.0005555555555555901,0.04979723408481357,0.0005555555555555901,0.0005555555555555901,0.0005555555555555901,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

55938,3,Great Value . Twenty bucks for three name brand skillets is a great price . They are not part of Farberware 's higher end line ( obviously from the price . any educated consumer will recognize and admit this . ) The bottom line is that they do what they 're supposed to do . We are replacing a very heavy Revereware Non - stick pan my wife bought 1.5 years ago . The teflon wa flaking off . She had paid $ 45 for it . we decided that most of the supermarket non - stick frying pans we 've had over the years lasted 1 - 2 years and they were usually $ 13 - 20 . This Farberware set is a great value,126,1,0.0006666666666667139,0.0006666666666667139,0.0006666666666667139,0.0006666666666667139,0.10634014145391608,0.0006666666666667139,0.0006666666666667139,0.0006666666666667139,0.0006666666666667139,0.0006666666666667139,0.0006666666666667139,0.0006666666666667139,0.0006666666666667139,0.0006666666666667139,0.0006666666666667139,0.0006666666666667139,0.0006666666666667139,0.0006666666666667139,0.03400000000000058,0.0006666666666667139,0.0006666666666667139,0.0006666666666667139,0.0006666666666667139,0.0006666666666667139,0.0006666666666667139,0.026762962279386716,0.10175890792608043,0.0006666666666667139,0.03404137673984095,0.0006666666666667139,0.0006666666666667139,0.0006666666666667139,0.0006666666666667139,0.0006666666666667139,0.07425804093127181,0.0006666666666667139,0.0006666666666667139,0.0006666666666667139,0.0006666666666667139,0.0006666666666667139,0.20775612842276966,0.0006666666666667139,0.06733333333333262,0.0006666666666667139,0.28258484456343513,0.0006666666666667139,0.03849759768329752,0.0006666666666667139,0.0006666666666667139,0.0006666666666667139,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0

55957,3,"Works well and looks nice I was looking for a kettle with a handle that I could pick up without using an oven mitt , and one that does n't require removal of the whistle ( also with oven mitt of course ) before pouring . This kettle fit the bill . The handle as well as the whistle are plastic and cool to the touch . The whistle flips up with a touch of your thumb and does not require removal . I have been pleasantly surprised by the kettle beyond the two features above ( which I would have thought would be standard on every kettle , but that is so not the case ) . It looks nice and is sturdily constructed . The whistle is a gentle reminder , not a screaming alarm . It holds a lot of water , enough for about 8 cups of tea plus a little water to rinse out / pre - heat the tea pot with . My only suggestion for improvement is for the handle . Because it 's a straight bar across , it 's not very ergonomic for pouring . I often find my right wrist at a strange , almost uncomfortable angle .

55978,3,"Makes cooking fun ! I love this thing ! Not only does it perform beautifully , but it 's absolutely gorgeous . I prefer to serve meals in it rather than one of my pretty platters . I waited a pretty long time ( almost a year ) before writing my review to make sure I abused it enough . This is my 2nd review . Because it 's well made , it 's pretty heavy ... that 's why the "" helper handle "" is so helpful . We have a chicken salad about 4 times a week so I wanted a really big pan to be able to sear my chicken all at once without having to work in shifts . To clean and sanitize stuff , I put EVERYTHING in the dishwasher ... vacuum attachments , toothbrushes , dog and cat toys etc ... so the fact that this fits in my dishwasher is awesome for me . I wash it by hand about 1/2 the time . The nonstick coating is wonderful ... not a scrape or scratch on it . Pay particular attention to cleaning the rivets ( that might be the wrong terminology ) that attach the handle to the pan on the inside . The dishwasher gets all the icky stuff out of every crevice , but I use a soft dish brush for the rivets if washing by hand.:-",237,1,0.00044444444444448415,0.07915113901089213,0.023669331596863175,0.02279549312906198,0.00044444444444448415,0.00044444444444448415,0.00044444444444448415,0.00044444444444448415,0.00044444444444448415,0.00044444444444448415,0.00044444444444448415,0.022666107384416375,0.23280264278531648,0.00044444444444448415,0.00044444444444448415,0.00044444444444448415,0.1487149865038469,0.00044444444444448415,0.00044444444444448415,0.00044444444444448415,0.00044444444444448415,0.07399840605034545,0.00044444444444448415,0.00044444444444448415,0.00044444444444448415,0.04094749927535204,0.00044444444444448415,0.00044444444444448415,0.00044444444444448415,0.00044444444444448415,0.00044444444444448415,0.00044444444444448415,0.00044444444444448415,0.00044444444444448415,0.00044444444444448415,0.00044444444444448415,0.00044444444444448415,0.00044444444444448415,0.00044444444444448415,0.050287590426921214,0.00044444444444448415,0.00044444444444448415,0.00044444444444448415,0.00044444444444448415,0.20564878344499168,0.00044444444444448415,0.08198468705865754,0.00044444444444448415,0.00044444444444448415,0.00044444444444448415,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0

56008,4,"Sex in quarantine Maybe for some people , to spend 40 days without sex is not big deal , but in Matt Sullivan 's case , it could be a total nightmare . After his girlfriend Nicole leaves him , Matt spends about six months devouring girls , until he starts to hallucinate . Advised by his brother , Matt decides that celibacy is the answer to his problems , and proposes to go through lent without sex . For Matt 's friends , this odyssey is as absurd as impossible , and immediately they take advantage of the situation to make bets about how long will last Matt 's abstinence . He does n't have it easy , as many temptations will make him suffer , and even smell the possibility of a new love.40 days and 40 nights is a movie that tries to get the most comedy possible out of the sexual frustration of his leading character . In a similar way that other grotesque comedies have try to explode in the past years , this film tries to sell us the idea that relationships based only in sex are less satisfactory than those based on love .

56015,4,"no title Well , I sure could have skipped this one . I well remember the critics raving over this on television , but why is beyond me . Mostly , I was just plain bored . There simply was no depth at all , just bunches of short takes and wise cracks . Bush was just downright dirty , making insults and slurs all over the place , something I do not consider an appropriate attitude in a man who would be President . And it is interesting that in one of the reviews it was noted that Mary Matalen , the deputy manager of Bush 's campaign and very acid - tongued ( maybe she wrote some of the slurs Bush used ) , is now the wife of James Carville , top strategist for Clinton 's campaign , and basically the star of the movie .

56018,4,"No Diamonds .... Just Rough This movie was so horrible I do n't know where to start . Maybe I could start with the fact the actors were so horrible it was as if the director picked them randomly off the street . Or maybe he just casted his own family ... at any rate they were untrained and stale . Secondly , I had a serious issue with this movie not following basic christian principles . If Tyler Perry manages to tone down the swearing in his semi - christian plays , why would n't this movie director have enough sense to follow suit ... If you 're trying to actually sale to a christian audience . Furthermore , I thought the bible said a little something against divorce ; like it was n't permitted unless your spouse commits adultery / fornication . This movie seems to say it 's okay to go against the word of God if you 're in love . In fact , christianity was more of a theory in this movie than it was a practice .... by even the protagonist ! I laugh as I think of the scene where Ce - Ce Peniston 's character says seductively , "" I 'm looking for a man with his mind on Jesus "" Yet she 's dressed like a hooker . Speaking of clothing , why did Ce - Ce seem to change outfits even in the middle of scene . They go on a date and she 's dressed one way , by the time they come home she has on something different ; with no logical explanation . And please explain why they had someone 's grandfather playing the role of Rico Suave . Maybe the movie would have actually been worth while had he looked more like the man of any woman 's dream . I felt more like telling him about AARP than I did falling in love with him . In addition , the soundtrack , IT - WAS - JUST - ANNOYING . At some parts it was even hard to hear what the characters were saying because of the music . I just wanted the maddness to stop ! Lastly , It seems as if the director tried to portray single church women as being overwhelmingly desperate ( although some are ) However , having pamela fall so quickly for bryant was just , well , almost juvenile ... perhaps even a disrespect to women at large . Overall , this movie made me want to puke . PASTOR Larry "" Flash "" Jenkins really needs to get some true insight on the conditions of the church and maybe even go back and read the bible for himself for clarity",463,0,0.13975645394897362,0.00021505376344088195,0.00021505376344088195,0.00021505376344088195,0.00021505376344088195,0.00021505376344088195,0.00021505376344088195,0.05429095952363778,0.00021505376344088195,0.00021505376344088195,0.00021505376344088195,0.00021505376344088195,0.18779102654564048,0.00021505376344088195,0.00021505376344088195,0.00021505376344088195,0.00021505376344088195,0.00021505376344088195,0.00021505376344088195,0.00021505376344088195,0.5007320460914038,0.00021505376344088195,0.00021505376344088195,0.00021505376344088195,0.00021505376344088195,0.0320832779485575,0.00021505376344088195,0.00021505376344088195,0.00021505376344088195,0.00021505376344088195,0.00021505376344088195,0.00021505376344088195,0.00021505376344088195,0.00021505376344088195,0.07588387035038838,0.00021505376344088195,0.00021505376344088195,0.00021505376344088195,0.00021505376344088195,0.00021505376344088195,0.00021505376344088195,0.00021505376344088195,0.00021505376344088195,0.00021505376344088195,0.00021505376344088195,0.00021505376344088195,0.00021505376344088195,0.00021505376344088195,0.00021505376344088195,0.00021505376344088195,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

DVDs are great because they 're inexpensive teaching aids when it comes to foreign languages ... but only when the DVDs actually have other tracks than English .

56044,4,"Insert pun with word "" con "" here ... "" Con Express "" has lots of action in it , which is great because this hides the poor writing and uninteresting characters . Unfortunately , the action is n't enough , and in between stunt pieces and shoot - outs , the audience is tempted to doze off . City Heat Productions is n't really known for producing films of the highest quality , so usually I go easy on them . If this were a big - budget company producing this , I 'd be inclined to pan it entirely . But I was n't expecting much and got a little more than I bargained for . The action is , for the most part , pretty good but nothing competitive with your usual dumb action movie . Flanery and Vosloo are perfectly casted , but everyone else seems to stiff to add any more flow to the movie . Vosloo especially appears to be enjoying himself as an over - the - top bad guy hijacking a train containing deadly chemicals . The film moves fast and contains shades of better movies like Under Siege 2 , Con Air , Spy Game , and Speed . If you liked those , you probably wo n't mind this one too much .

56054,4,"DEAD MOVIE Shame on talented actors like Maura Tierney and Jerry Orbach for their involvement in this laughably bad mystery movie . Uninspired direction with a trite and convoluted script combine with terrible acting to make a movie that has little to recommend it . "" Star""/co - writer John Romo is one of the worst leading men to come around the bend in some time , and this is his only film , and I can see why . He plays a private investigator who finds himself looking into the murders of several lingerie models whose underwear was designed by Tierney , who also works in a local factory run by Orbach . Dennis Christopher shows up as a seedy illegal alien investigator ; and June Lockhart and Lyle Waggoner lend their names to supporting roles as Tierney 's estranged parents . The movie professes to make some statement on the poor treatment of immigrants but it 's so shoddily included , it makes no statement at all .

56066,4,"There 's no person like this person Betty Hutton has a colossal amount of energy . She seems to be doing everything she possibly can to be entertaining . She 's a good sport about a funny but unflattering getup in her early hayseed numbers . Her voice is sturdy , durable , indestructible . But oh my God , her acting choices ... She and the Indians are stampeding around with performances far too broad for the medium of film ( whereas Buffalo Bill , allegedly a larger - than - life character , looks like a corpse by comparison , and Howard Keel , in only his second film , must manage to act like these are human beings he 's relating to ) . Take a look at Betty Hutton 's reaction upon seeing Howard Keel for the first time -- the mugging would be considered "" a bit much "" if seen from the back row of an amphitheater . At best , her performance is clownlike ; at worst , it 's apelike . Little of her performance overlaps with what we know as humanity . It 's a magnificent effort , and a stunning testimony to her desire to please , but her comedy has no reality , no nuance , no connection to any sincere emotion . She seizes on "" hick "" and drives that into the ground , then she plays nothing but "" infatuated "" for a while before toggling to "" resentful "" and so forth ... It 's a series of masks and set pieces , but it 's not a character . Judy Garland was in sad shape at that point in her life , but even then she would have been able to find the vulnerability flickering behind Annie 's rootin'-tootinest moments , and she would n't have neglected Annie 's grit even in the melting sentimental scenes . Nobody can do vulnerability like Judy , and yet few are identified so strongly as survivors -- both qualities that would serve this character . Annie could be a wonderful character , a great self - conflicted mess of strength , longing , guts , femininity , skill , naivete and worldiness , all trying to cohere into a woman who can win her man -- but instead Betty Hutton makes her a pop - eyed , crude cartoon with the subtlety of an iron skillet . I am surprised that Hutton did n't insist on doing the role with a couple of teeth blacked out . Maybe they just would n't let her . The scenes where she tries to read out loud are compelling for the way they illustrate someone playing for a cheap laugh , oblivious to any further potential the character and situation might provide . I kept replaying scenes over and over in awe before moving on , and the memory of Betty Hutton 's performance is branded on my brain , but it 's because this performance seems like it 's following the traditions of some other culture , some other world . It 's like going to a sideshow . That said , the tunes are a non - stop parade of hits -- there probably is n't any other show in which the composer so successfully nails so many numbers one after another , in wildly different styles , with effective melodies worth remembering . The classic tunes just keep coming . The movie works as spectacle and songfest , and as a startling specimen of what audiences would swallow in the days before political correctness . But if you 're looking for a portrayal of a woman with genuine feelings and motivations , you might be distracted by the gorgeous blonde chimpanzee who steals all her scenes .",640,0,0.00021739130434784566,0.00021739130434784566,0.00021739130434784566,0.00021739130434784566,0.00021739130434784566,0.00021739130434784566,0.00021739130434784566,0.09579781456236576,0.00021739130434784566,0.00021739130434784566,0.00021739130434784566,0.03060716221747051,0.06917766631027845,0.00021739130434784566,0.00021739130434784566,0.00021739130434784566,0.00021739130434784566,0.00021739130434784566,0.00021739130434784566,0.00021739130434784566,0.4320518778827471,0.00021739130434784566,0.00021739130434784566,0.012452310684398003,0.00021739130434784566,0.012630287442626472,0.00021739130434784566,0.00021739130434784566,0.00021739130434784566,0.02480820626344132,0.00021739130434784566,0.00021739130434784566,0.04263008583682172,0.00021739130434784566,0.00021739130434784566,0.00021739130434784566,0.00021739130434784566,0.00021739130434784566,0.00021739130434784566,0.00021739130434784566,0.00021739130434784566,0.00021739130434784566,0.00021739130434784566,0.270931545321589,0.00021739130434784566,0.00021739130434784566,0.00021739130434784566,0.00021739130434784566,0.00021739130434784566,0.00021739130434784566,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

56096,4,"Scarlett Margarett Mitchell must be rolling in her grave . She wrote a masterpiece in the 1930 's , then Alexandra Ripley bought the rights to her book by conning Margaret Mitchell 's heirs to sell out the legacy of their relative . Alexandra Ripley 's novel was an embarrasing pile of mush , even worse than a Barbara Courtland romance novel . Beautiful costumes and a good cast - but the script is a soap opera and very poorly written with too many cliche 's . The TV movie version is even worse than Alexandra Ripley 's book . I would have given this movie zero stars - but gave it 2 stars solely for the world class acting of Sean Bean as the deliciously evil Lord Fenton . Sean Bean heats up the screen as a sexy , feral villian along the lines of "" The Man You Love to Hate "" as an unsafe sex symbol . Unless you are a Sean Bean fan , there is nothing worthwhile about this film . The script is trite , cliche'd and very slow moving . Sean Bean is only in Disc 1 and his character is eliminated and the movie slides downhill from there . Disc 2 is overwrought with very boring , drawn out courtroom scenes ... I was almost rooting that Scarlett would be hanged for the murder just to see an end to this movie!I've always liked Joanna Whaley - Kilmer and Timothy Dalton . They are excellent actors wasted in this pile of mush movie . Ann - Margaret 's performance as Belle Watling is so bad I wanted to slap her .

56100,4,"The Most Biased Movie I 've Watched in Long Long Time Whatever ills are in the world , it 's all the fault of the corporations . That 's the basic premise of this terribly misguided one - sided and totally non - objective movie . For example , instead of saying how terrible it is for companies paying people in the developing world peanuts for their work , they forget that these people 's alternatives ARE EVEN WORSE and that 's why they took that job in the first place ! These jobs provide them with one of the few options they have and , if they chose that job freely , it must be their BEST option , no matter how crazy it seems to us . As people 's skills rise , as opportunities increase over time ( by having MORE corporations and not less , to create more competition for these people 's labor ) , and as the country becomes wealthier , these people 's wages will rise automaticaly and in fact , the wages of the whole country on the average . There are no shortcuts to his . A famous story comes from Nepal where anti - child labor laws , at the urging of the UN , turned thousands of kids overnight into prostitutes as those jobs , as sad as it may be , were their best options to avoid starvation and feed their families . It 's a slow process , but all the industrialized nations went through that process . Government - mandated "" shortcuts "" usually produce results which are even worse . However , the results speak for themselves : in VERY short period of time , for example , HUNDRDS OF MILLIONS of people were lifted out of poverty in China , India and around the world thanks for the "" evil "" capalism its corporations . No other system has ever done it so quickly as in the past 15 years in China and India alone . Also , cost of living is very low there , so these pennies really can go a long way , do n't measure it to the cost of living in the West . What is the filmmakers alternative they offer for these people ? I guess to let people starve to death , then the makers of this movie do n't have have anyting to complain about ! ? Other examples of stupidity include showing that a company is like a person who 's a psychopath . A corpoartion is a legal entity yes , and may act like a separate "" being "" as far the law in concerned , but does a corporation have a nose , feet , stomach ? Can it eat apples or sneeze or have arthritis ? Of course , not , than how can you attach a human idea like a psychopath to it ? ? Several of the main "" spokepersons "" in the movie , Chomsky , Michael Moore , Rifkin and others are renowned for their off - the - wall comments which frequently have NO basis in any kind of economics or reality . To correct the inaccuracies in the statements made by these and other people in the movie , you 'd have to stop it every 5 minutes and explain to the audience how profoundly wrong the statements are . Throughout the whole movie , you 're basically bombarded by one - sided arguments with VERY little of the other side presented , despite the director 's claim of the opposite 9they claim 1/2 1/2 , it 's more like 80%-20 % ) . Just look at Chomsky 's comments about how the consumers are so stupid , they do n't realize that all the things they buy they do n't really need . I mean we do n't need fashionable clothes ( hey , let 's all dress as boring as Chomsky ! ) , DVD players , or any new gadgets that make life easier or more fun . Who is the judge of what you REALLY need ? Chomsky , of course . He is the final arbiter of what you really need or what you do n't . You 're too stupid to know what you want , according to him . He says that you should do "" more important things "" , like ... perhaps studying lingistics ( which he teaches but which very few care about ) . The movie DOES make some correct and good observations , especially regarding polution , however , I 'd say that 80 % of the movie is factually and logically flawed . It 's also FULL of economic fallacies . It 's worth watching I guess , just to see how many errors one can make in just 1 movie . Despite all the ranting in the movie , it fails to mention THE biggest reason of most of the problems it brings up - too much governement interference is every facet of life . For examples , how could a Government of Brazil forbit the people of collecting rain water ! How could the U.S. government do so many things for private companies with public funds ? Just forbid the governments from playing favorites with companies , forbid government corporate welfare of ANY kind , forbid subsidies to companies , cut the suffocating red tape and regulation ( esp . in developing countries but in the West too ) , cut corporate taxes to 5 or 10 % ( and see unemployment rate go to almost nothing , give people all around the world a better life , increase competition , etc . ) If these and other governments ( and not corporations ' ) problems were eliminated , the vast majority of ALL the problems which the movie brings up will simply go away . An interesing film for anyone to see how the truth can be twisted by mindless people with an agenda to go back to 15th century rural lifestile ( spoken about with much admiration ) , people with NO understanding about economics , how the world really works and how to REALLY raise the billions out of poverty who this movie does the biggest disservice for .",1062,0,0.24810662214701876,0.03598882463039612,0.00012195121951220672,0.00012195121951220672,0.00012195121951220672,0.015599798414633256,0.00012195121951220672,0.17378734205575416,0.00012195121951220672,0.00012195121951220672,0.00012195121951220672,0.00012195121951220672,0.00012195121951220672,0.00012195121951220672,0.00012195121951220672,0.00012195121951220672,0.00012195121951220672,0.019950552314742204,0.012316485424673075,0.00012195121951220672,0.3262218124903838,0.0450933143728585,0.00012195121951220672,0.00012195121951220672,0.00012195121951220672,0.00012195121951220672,0.00012195121951220672,0.00012195121951220672,0.00012195121951220672,0.00012195121951220672,0.00012195121951220672,0.00012195121951220672,0.022839935830776197,0.00012195121951220672,0.00012195121951220672,0.00012195121951220672,0.00012195121951220672,0.00012195121951220672,0.00012195121951220672,0.00012195121951220672,0.00981741218764206,0.004246522459802113,0.019940359291224424,0.00012195121951220672,0.049777043265026855,0.011923731212628836,0.00012195121951220672,0.00012195121951220672,0.00012195121951220672,0.00012195121951220672,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0

56142,4,"Here we go again I gave this movie 1 star because it is not a true documentary . It falls more along the same fodder as "" Spinal Tap "" . It is missing a counter point from GM . One could argue that Roger had chances to talk with Moore , but choose not to . One the other hand , Rogers missing interview is what gave the movie such an emotional hold . I believe that Moore counted on not being granted air time at GM for the production of this film . An interview would have killed the tone . Watch the nightly news NOW . Last night , March 22nd 2006 , GM offered a one time buy out to some of it 's employees . The news reported that GM can not afford to maintain its relationship with the UAW ( Just like what caused the Flint situation in the film ) .

56163,4,"maybe it just has n't aged well ... ok , I 've only just seen this film for the first time , so it 's hard to really judge the social impact it had 13 years ago and its importance in that respect , but this is not a particularly good film . I mean , it has its choice moments where it really comes together . the shot of caine downing a 40 in the korean grocers is imaginitively directed . any scene with o - dog is almost guaranteed classic status . samuel jackson 's in it . and if you 're a fan of dave chapelle 's tyrone biggums crackhead character , the token crackhead in this film is worth a few laughs for his to - the - tee similarity.but that 's really my problem with this film . serious issues are reduced to a series of ham - fisted archetypes straight out of central casting . and they 're ALL here : the homey black grandparents , the nation of islam convert , the socially conscious mother whose son is starting to go down caine 's road ... all characters that might fare better in a different film that treats these issues with more subtlety and depth.take the french film ' la haine ' , for instance . it clearly took a lot of inspiration from menace 2 society , boyz n tha hood , etc . , but its characters actually feel tormented , instead of just having lots of scenes written FOR them to show their torment . rather than just running through a laundry list of problems , one - by - one , scene - by - scene , it really gets to the heart of something bigger , some grander alienation that urban youths feel , which is what menace 2 society would like to be able to do . plus , if you can believe it , the hip - hop in ' la haine ' is quite a bit better.so while I would definitely recommend seeing this film , keep the remote aimed and ready , finger on the fast - forward button . maybe about a half - hour of this film is really worth watching , whereas the other 70 minutes are mostly just dull moralising . oh yeah , and there 's a really embarrassing - to - watch sex scene thrown in for no particular reason . oh , also , the filmmakers apparently think people who have just been shot look like they are being electrocuted while spitting out cherry slurpees . in a film that did n't try to carry so much social weight , that kind of thing would be ok because you could laugh it off as bad filmmaking , but it really just cheapens this one",477,0,0.0001941747572815708,0.0001941747572815708,0.0001941747572815708,0.0001941747572815708,0.0001941747572815708,0.0001941747572815708,0.0001941747572815708,0.0001941747572815708,0.0001941747572815708,0.0001941747572815708,0.0001941747572815708,0.0001941747572815708,0.16734154719739,0.0001941747572815708,0.025285184470713727,0.0001941747572815708,0.0001941747572815708,0.0001941747572815708,0.00989436980451963,0.0001941747572815708,0.0001941747572815708,0.24058942357927426,0.014986231309424027,0.02761404327451774,0.0001941747572815708,0.0001941747572815708,0.0001941747572815708,0.0001941747572815708,0.0001941747572815708,0.0001941747572815708,0.0001941747572815708,0.0001941747572815708,0.0001941747572815708,0.0001941747572815708,0.0001941747572815708,0.01448603832633546,0.0001941747572815708,0.0001941747572815708,0.03442353295211192,0.0001941747572815708,0.024927253608024082,0.01969590417933129,0.023291477350041424,0.39008635317161694,0.0001941747572815708,0.0001941747572815708,0.0001941747572815708,0.0001941747572815708,0.0001941747572815708,0.0001941747572815708,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
56168,4,"Dry comedy for people who do n't like dry comedy This show deserved to get cancelled , and there 's a very simple reason . This is supposedly dry , subtle comedy for people who do n't usually like dry , subtle comedy . It 's a show that was presented to the FOX audience , an audeince that normally likes the most inane , low - brow kind of humor , that does n't know what dry comedy is and would fall for a pitiful imitation of it . Meanwhile , to people who actually appreciate subtlety and dry humor , the so - called comedy in the show is unbelievably obvious and predictable . Every time a line is spoken on that show that is supposed to be a joke , it 's clear how forced and contrived it is , how hard the creators of this show are trying to fake dry humor , something they clearly do n't understand . It 's embarrassing for someone with appreciation for humor to watch , because the jokes are so uninspired and fall so flat . It 's just an awkward mess . But those are n't the people this show is targeted at . It 's targeted at that FOX audience who has never even seen dry humor before , and so anything even resembling it is new and amazing to them . They think this show is brilliant because it 's a little smarter than MAD TV , or at least thinks it is . And since those are the people who are seeing the show , you hear all these people raving about how brilliant it is . If the show were on HBO or some other network , exposed to a different kind of audience , you would hear a lot more negative response to it from people who like dry comedy that actually works . So why did this show get cancelled , when so many people think it 's so amazing ? If it 's so great , people would have actually watched it , right ? So where were the ratings ? The fact is , the people who love this show are a very vocal minority . The audience for dry humor did n't watch this show because it 's not funny . But the audience who was fooled by this show , as vocal as they are , was just too small : they were people who were encountering something other than inanity for the first time in their lives and thought it would make them look smart to pretend to like it . This is not one of those shows that was cancelled because it was too smart for TV , as its apologists claim . No , it simply was a completely unfunny failure that was only impressive to people who have never heard anything but fart jokes",490,0,0.18293523175737536,0.00021739130434784857,0.00021739130434784857,0.00021739130434784857,0.038597417168305094,0.00021739130434784857,0.022068319281103182,0.06584352805381635,0.00021739130434784857,0.00021739130434784857,0.00021739130434784857,0.00021739130434784857,0.00021739130434784857,0.00021739130434784857,0.00021739130434784857,0.00021739130434784857,0.00021739130434784857,0.00021739130434784857,0.00021739130434784857,0.00021739130434784857,0.6659659943713935,0.00021739130434784857,0.00021739130434784857,0.00021739130434784857,0.015024291976701338,0.00021739130434784857,0.00021739130434784857,0.00021739130434784857,0.00021739130434784857,0.00021739130434784857,0.00021739130434784857,0.00021739130434784857,0.00021739130434784857,0.00021739130434784857,0.00021739130434784857,0.00021739130434784857,0.00021739130434784857,0.00021739130434784857,0.00021739130434784857,0.00021739130434784857,0.00021739130434784857,0.00021739130434784857,0.00021739130434784857,0.00021739130434784857,0.00021739130434784857,0.00021739130434784857,0.00021739130434784857,0.00021739130434784857,0.00021739130434784857,0.00021739130434784857,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

56181,4,"What passes for science these days is sad As an environmental scientist , I find these soft - science / hardball political presentations of the global warming discussion distressing and unhelpful . While they rally the convinced , having partisan political types at the forefront of the discussion is probably unhelpful . To wit , about a third of this movie turns out to be a self promotion video complete with a replay of 2000 election footage . About the "" movie "" : it 's actually a filmation of the presentation Al Gore has made for some time on Global Warming . In it he tries to make the case that nearly everything we are measuring on this dynamic earth is the result of man - made CO2 and other green - house gasses . The audience is bombarded with a long series of charts , graphs , and suppositions that make for a compelling argument - IF one has little or no knowledge coming into the presentation . And this is where this production goes terribly wrong , the fact checking was terrible , the cherry - picked data was obvious and heavy - handed , and finally the movie ends up serving those who oppose any discussion of global warming more than it helps the cause . Two examples : An Inconvenient Truth asserts that a sea - level rise of 20 feet is a realistic short - term prospect - yet , the 2005 joint statement by the science academies of the Western nations warns of sea - level rise in the four to 35 inches range in the 21st century . Gore discusses the Earth 's atmosphere as relatively thin , and declares that , "" The problem we now face is that this thin layer of atmosphere is being thickened by huge quantities of carbon dioxide . "" Hello ? Thickness has nothing to do with global warming people . Carbon dioxide has molecular bonds that vibrate on the same wavelengths at which infrared energy radiates upward from Earth 's surface - meaning that the vibration warms the CO2 , which makes things hotter . Further the references to nitrogen are pure nonsense , since it does n't play a role . My warning is to not let the politicians ruin the scientific process , no matter how noble the cause may be .",400,0,0.14515892985032425,0.10502651648225408,0.0004347826086957002,0.0004347826086957002,0.0004347826086957002,0.0004347826086957002,0.0004347826086957002,0.22946351779792637,0.04738412254551779,0.0004347826086957002,0.0004347826086957002,0.0004347826086957002,0.0004347826086957002,0.0004347826086957002,0.0004347826086957002,0.0004347826086957002,0.0004347826086957002,0.0004347826086957002,0.02217391304347887,0.03783588144975215,0.23829865249743856,0.0004347826086957002,0.0004347826086957002,0.023057686679257186,0.0004347826086957002,0.0004347826086957002,0.0004347826086957002,0.0004347826086957002,0.0004347826086957002,0.0004347826086957002,0.0004347826086957002,0.0004347826086957002,0.0004347826086957002,0.0004347826086957002,0.0004347826086957002,0.0004347826086957002,0.0004347826086957002,0.0004347826086957002,0.0004347826086957002,0.0004347826086957002,0.0004347826086957002,0.0004347826086957002,0.0004347826086957002,0.0004347826086957002,0.0004347826086957002,0.13377469269752704,0.0004347826086957002,0.0004347826086957002,0.0004347826086957002,0.0004347826086957002,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

56188,4,"What a snooze fest . It is hard to believe that the same team that made Gettysburg made this verbose waste of time . This movie almost guarantees that The Last Full Measure will never be filmed and that is a shame . It was a mistake to take Stephen Lang and put him in the role of Jackson . Jackson was considered , even by his contemporaries , a military genius but crazy by half . The film missed the mark with their attempt to show his religious convictions and his devotion to duty . Lang had him speaking in long winded prose that sounded like bad soap opera dialog desperately trying to be Shakespearean . The prayer scene in the morning ? PUKE ! It could have been a voice over with battles scenes or soldiers marching , or anything else rather than what became just a terrible scene . Most of the "" women "" folk of the south were equally sappy and long winded , and I hate to say it but I was glad when the too precocious for words overacting child died of scarlet fever I was glad to be rid of her . Her scenes should have been left on the cutting room floor . I get it Jackson was "" such a warrior and a peaceful lover of children at the same time what a diametrically opposed individual "" give me a break , I hate being force feed like that . A better Director could have gotten the same point across quicker and more subtly . Then there is Chamberlain quoting Shakespeare while all around him look off to the distance with thousand yard stares . There is supposedly 4 to 6 hours of footage lying around to this film . I would love to see it reworked by a better director into what it should have been . A narrative like Gettysburg that goes back and forth between a few central characters in a logical sequence without all the ham fisted attempts a proselytizing and all the noblesse oblige . If you must see it borrow it , rent it , but do n't waste money buying it unless it is in the $ 3 bin at the local dirtmart . Gettysburg is much better .

56194,4,"A disgrace to the Mexican - American people . How about "" zero stars "" ? I saw this movie a while back only because the family of the girl I was dating at the time was watching it and therefore was forced to sit down and watch it too . To this day , I pray I do n't ever have to sit through 2 hours of crap that trashes the reputations of the average mexican - american again . As a mexican - american who has worked hard to take the right road in life , I was disturbed at the storyline of this wannabee classic . Do we really need to come out with a movie for all of America to see that shows a negative side of the mexican race ? Prison sex ? Babies drinking beer ? Young kids doing a drive by ? Mexicans killing innocent blacks and vice versa ? Please ! ! ! ! Wake up mexicans - americans ! We need some positivity ! ! ! ! ! Edward James Olmos said he made this movie because he wanted to send a message . What message ? That doing the things shown in this movie are bad ? I think we knew that already ! What surprises me alot is all the positive reviews on Amazon that this movie got . This of course means that no matter how much sense I have made , it is more than likely that no one will find my review helpful . P.S .... Let us not forget that I am not the only one who thinks negative about this film . Several consultants involved in this film were murdered by individual(s ) out there who found the movie offensive . Edward James Olmos himself was the center of threats following the release of this movie .

56207,4,"I figure if I study high , take the test high , get high scores ! Right ? How High is a film that lends nothing , I repeat , nothing to the film community at large . I have read some critics that say that this film introduced a whole new generation to the Cheech Chong of the new millennium with the Redman / Method Man pairing . While most seem to agree that this is a horrible film , very few of them mention how utterly racist the overall experience happens to be . When I use the word racist , I mean that it builds upon the degenerate clich � s that African Americans struggle with on a daily basis with our society . While there were elements in this film that seemed like there was some reverse racism occurring , what struck me hardest in the face was how embarrassing Method Man and Redman must be to both the film community , but also to their own culture . I have a very open mind when it comes to social issues as well as films , but this one left my jaw on the floor several times . The blatant swings at African American stereotypes were meant to be a source of humor for director Jesse Dylan , but instead fell flat on their embarrassed face . Humor was in very short supply in this film due to the ethnic stereotype clich � s that seemed to be used nearly every second of this film . Nothing was original . Nothing was exciting . Was the pairing of Redman and Method Man an idea of comedic proportions ? I think not . As you can tell from their short lived series after the release of this film , the corporate world wanted to cash in on these two rappers , but soon realized that they were not as bankable as they thought . Why ? Method Man and Redman , who completely different people , were nothing more than the same character in this film . With the very subtle hints of Method Man being smarter , nothing could separate the equality of these two characters . That is why they failed as a comic team . Think of Matthau and Lemmon or the above example of Cheech Chong , what made these teams work while the How High team crashed and burned ? What worked the best were the differences that uniquely drew the pair together . Their differences made us laugh and sympathetically brought them together , but with Method Man and Redman , they were the same . I was watching the same two characters fight through the same two challenges in this film . What tried to be funny instead transformed into repetitive . What Dylan did to counter the similarity between Redman / Method Man was bring in obscure secondary characters that added nothing to the flimsy plot or helped us feel emotion for our two main characters . The clich � jock , the clich � frat boy , the clich � Asian ( which was again another racist moment ) , and the clich � rich white boy , just felt and were old . Watch college films from the 70s and you will see these same combinations , but what makes the films from the 70s different is that they used them with originality . How High , from beginning to end , was anything but original . I must admit , after watching this film of which Harvard was willing to loan their name to , I do n't want to go to Harvard . They should have pondered the effects this film would have upon their prestige heritage . How High is a dark spot in Harvard 's history . Do you know what makes it even worse ? This film was n't even created at or anywhere near Harvard . Again , Dylan was cutting corners to create a false sense of realism that continued to hurt this film . How High has no redeeming qualities . Ooops , I stand corrected . The only smile that was ever created on my face during this film was when Spalding Gray spoke . How did they get him and Fred Willard to do this film ? I have said it once , I will say it again , some actors just need their bills paid . Inconsistency , incompetence , and aggravation seemed to be the hidden themes of this dud . What destroyed this film further is that if you take the actors away and look at the story in general , it is nothing . There is no original story at all with How High . Going to college , working for your grades , winning over the heart of the President right at the last minute - this was nothing short of a "" cut and paste "" film that had no backbone and horrid acting!I do not like Jesse Dylan 's style of directing . While I think Kicking and Screaming is his prized film ( due greatly to Will Ferrell ) , all of his films seem to be extremely choppy with the editing and are randomly interjected with an overdose of unnecessary scenes . The John Adams scene in How High is a prime example . The Benjamin Franklin moments is another . The unconcluded "" Truth Serum "" can be considered another . How High was just scene after scene of inconsistency . Lumpy oatmeal would win first place before this film would ever be congratulated ! I blame a majority of the issues with this film on Jesse Dylan . If he would have tightened the script , created unique and "" cult - like "" characters , and eliminated the racism , he may have had the quintessential "" weed "" film in Hollywood . Now , all he has is a violent case of the munchies and nothing to show for . Sad . Overall , this was one of the worst films that I have witnessed . Never have I been so emotionally charged about the racist moments in this film as I have with How High . The actors , all around , were horrible . The story had no legs to stand on and it became very obvious after the opening credits that unless you were either 10 to 15 years of age , this film would never be considered a comedy .

56210,4,"The Rock and Vaughn stole the show Thankfully I watched this movie having recorded it on my DVR so I could fast forward through most of the scenes with Uma Thurman and John Travolta . Their scenes and dialogue were so horrible that fast forward was the only way to get through the movie . Besides , this is not the kind of movie that you really need their dialogue to understand or enjoy it . As usual , Uma 's acting is simply dreadful . I tend to avoid any movie with her in it because I know it will be bad . How she became a "" star "" in Hollywood is beyond me . She is not attractive nor can she act . She could have been replaced by a nobody and it would n't have changed the movie one bit . I think when they need an actress who does n't mind playing drivel roles , they call her . John Travolta is not much better . His version of "" cool "" just does n't do it for me . His diction is becoming more slurred as the years go by that I hate to hear him speak . And someone please tell Uma and John that nobdody wants to see them dance so please just stop finding reasons to do so . The ONLY reason I gave this movie 2 stars is because of The Rock and Vince Vaughn . Their roles were priceless and had me laughing all throughout the movie . I never grew tired of Vaughn pimping and The Rock primping . While I fast forwarded through Uma and Travolta 's scenes , I tended to rewind during Rock 's and Vaughn 's scenes ; they were so funny I had to see them again . Cedric the Entertainer was also pretty good .",313,0,0.00034482758620692434,0.00034482758620692434,0.00034482758620692434,0.00034482758620692434,0.00034482758620692434,0.00034482758620692434,0.017586206896550823,0.00034482758620692434,0.018524640960567496,0.00034482758620692434,0.00034482758620692434,0.00034482758620692434,0.00034482758620692434,0.00034482758620692434,0.00034482758620692434,0.00034482758620692434,0.10900494419007443,0.00034482758620692434,0.00034482758620692434,0.00034482758620692434,0.602679852684127,0.15929923328270795,0.00034482758620692434,0.00034482758620692434,0.00034482758620692434,0.00034482758620692434,0.00034482758620692434,0.00034482758620692434,0.00034482758620692434,0.00034482758620692434,0.00034482758620692434,0.00034482758620692434,0.00034482758620692434,0.00034482758620692434,0.00034482758620692434,0.00034482758620692434,0.00034482758620692434,0.00034482758620692434,0.00034482758620692434,0.00034482758620692434,0.020317846795670697,0.00034482758620692434,0.05775968898340358,0.00034482758620692434,0.00034482758620692434,0.00034482758620692434,0.00034482758620692434,0.00034482758620692434,0.00034482758620692434,0.00034482758620692434,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
56219,4,"not big on mixing musical with fantasy I never saw this movie until i was 16 . The girl i was dating at the time loved this movie . The rocky horror picture show was number one on her list so i tend to compare this one to that one not that the storys are similar in any way . But they do have one thing in common they are both horrible movies .

56223,4,"See the original ! I do n't know how this skunk got 4 and 1/2 stars on Amazon let alone one ! I could hear Hepburn , Bogart and Holden rolling over with a resounding boom . I think this is mainly because of Ford 's Linus . He is a very unsympathetic character in this remake . The film critics said that , while the original Sabrina was about her transformation , this version was about Linus ' transformation . But here Linus shows no transformation that you can really see .

56228,4,"The Plot Successfully Escaped HART 'S WAR had potential . The last months of World War Two as a backdrop with demoralized GI 's crammed into an overcrowded POW compound . If this picture was soley about the hardships endured by surrendered soldiers during the Battle of the Bulge , then it could have had a chance . Instead the film makers took on too many plots and subplots . Unintentionally the movie borrows from SLAUGHTERHOUSE FIVE , A SOLDIER 'S STORY , THE GREAT ESCAPE and STALAG 17 . A cardinal rule in war films is that the premise has to be simple . In HART 'S WAR we find some good elements lost in a virtual Mulligan stew . In the story Colin Farrell 's character , a rear echelon lawyer , accompanies another officer on what he thinks is a joyride . Unfortunately for Farrell , the Germans have launched their attack in the Ardennes . The young lawyer is captured , harshly interrogated , and finally shipped out to a German stalag . There he meets the senior POW officer , played by Bruce Willis , and tries to settle down in the dirty and uncomfortable life of a POW . A soldier is killed and a recently downed Tuskegee airman is accused of murder . Yes , you guessed it . Farrell takes on the aviator 's defense during the subsequent courts martial . If director Gregory Hoblit left the storyline to develop around the trial a decent film could have emerged . Instead we have additions of Colonel Hart 's unexplained behavior , an mass tunnel escape plot , sabotage and the German Commandant 's attempt to befriend the American lawyer as superfluous baggage . HART 'S WAR was filmed in the Czech Republic , no doubt to cut costs . A little more effort and a lot less story and this film would have had a better showing at the box office . Still , if you enjoy war movies you should probably add this DVD to your collection",346,0,0.000400000000000036,0.000400000000000036,0.000400000000000036,0.000400000000000036,0.000400000000000036,0.000400000000000036,0.000400000000000036,0.000400000000000036,0.000400000000000036,0.000400000000000036,0.000400000000000036,0.000400000000000036,0.000400000000000036,0.000400000000000036,0.000400000000000036,0.000400000000000036,0.000400000000000036,0.000400000000000036,0.000400000000000036,0.000400000000000036,0.000400000000000036,0.15922021581124954,0.000400000000000036,0.000400000000000036,0.000400000000000036,0.000400000000000036,0.026837575288611946,0.000400000000000036,0.000400000000000036,0.000400000000000036,0.000400000000000036,0.14517124277700771,0.000400000000000036,0.000400000000000036,0.09680807563646605,0.023700086601189354,0.000400000000000036,0.000400000000000036,0.000400000000000036,0.000400000000000036,0.000400000000000036,0.000400000000000036,0.020964353216507914,0.5100984506689658,0.000400000000000036,0.000400000000000036,0.000400000000000036,0.000400000000000036,0.000400000000000036,0.000400000000000036,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
56233,4,"fuzzy wuzzy Okay I admit , they had a shoesrting budget and did most if not all the work on the weekends with the help of friends . Heres my problem , they could have at least paid more attention to the focus of the camera , most of the scenes were blurry , every now and again the focus was clear , I mean c'mon , when I was fourteen I made a short stop motion animation film using an old Bell and Howell super 8 cam and even then I paid attention to the focusing . Okay enough of that , now for the pros of the film . The make - up fx were good and there is one scene that will make most MEN wince , the outdoor and some indoor settings had a NOTLD feel . Overall I recomend at least checking it out and make up your own minds , at least you can say you saw it . Rent if you can , if not , buy used",175,0,0.0007142857142857863,0.0007142857142857863,0.0007142857142857863,0.0007142857142857863,0.0007142857142857863,0.0007142857142857863,0.0007142857142857863,0.046841411386816724,0.0007142857142857863,0.0007142857142857863,0.0007142857142857863,0.036271504521087884,0.0007142857142857863,0.0007142857142857863,0.0007142857142857863,0.0007142857142857863,0.0007142857142857863,0.04225717323914646,0.0007142857142857863,0.0007142857142857863,0.0007142857142857863,0.11555124556661579,0.08586632137379638,0.0007142857142857863,0.0007142857142857863,0.0007142857142857863,0.0007142857142857863,0.0007142857142857863,0.0007142857142857863,0.0007142857142857863,0.0007142857142857863,0.0007142857142857863,0.0007142857142857863,0.0007142857142857863,0.0007142857142857863,0.0007142857142857863,0.0007142857142857863,0.0007142857142857863,0.0007142857142857863,0.0007142857142857863,0.0007142857142857863,0.0007142857142857863,0.0007142857142857863,0.5674593898088417,0.0007142857142857863,0.0007142857142857863,0.07503866838940625,0.0007142857142857863,0.0007142857142857863,0.0007142857142857863,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0
56249,4,"This film was not faithful to the adaptation of the novel . There 's lots of passion in Wide Sargasso Sea THE BOOK , but it 's mostly emotional . It 's an extremely multi - layered novel and the work of a true master . The film on the other hand is just your classic , bad 1990s film , beautiful to look at , with lots of skin , languid copulation , heaving bosoms , bodice - ripping nonsense , etc and next to no substance . It has no artistic integrity whatsoever , as its shameless makers must surely know they lifted their middle finger at the spirit of the Jean Rhys novel when choosing to make the film the way they did . I was unable to feel empathy for both the lead character . The much touted erotic scenes were not developed to what they lead to believe , and it also lacked much enthusiasm . They were incomplete and contributed little , if anything , to the plot . The viewer only gets a glimpse of the passion that supposedly exists between Edward and Antoinette . Therefore , they should have either gone all the way , tastefully ( no pun intended ) , or have left those scenes out entirely . Now with regards to the plot of this film there were enormous holes , which perhaps could be rectified by reading the book . But for those who have n't read the book , there should be enough information in the film itself to keep the reader afloat . From the start it was unclear what was really going on with this family ( despite the narration ) . Why did the ex - slaves keep laughing ? ( Something vaguely explained in the movie , though apparently fully explained in the book ) . Why did n't the parrot fly away ? What made the mother go nuts ? At no point in the movie were Mr. Rochester 's "" issues "" , as it were , fully explained . The man gets a letter exposing his wife as a Creole and dumps her like a hot potato , after ( as Christophene explains ) he was the one who came crawling to her in the first place . What a hypocrite . Again , maybe this is the ultimate point , that Mr. Rochester is a snob and the archetypical Victorian Englishman and that Antoinette is the victim of both his prejudice and that of the Jamaicans . But none of that exonerates the appallingly abrupt conclusion to the film . So , despite the beautiful cinematography , this movie is a hopeless muddle . I 'd highly recommend the novel by the way : a book you do n't forget in a hurry . Needless to say I think you should give this insulting ( to the memory of Jean Rhys ) film a miss , especially if you 've read the novel : it 'll just frustrate you , no matter how keen on a bit of easy titillation you may be feeling at the time .",529,0,0.00022222222222224812,0.00022222222222224812,0.00022222222222224812,0.00022222222222224812,0.00022222222222224812,0.00022222222222224812,0.00022222222222224812,0.00022222222222224812,0.00022222222222224812,0.00022222222222224812,0.00022222222222224812,0.01824291528685227,0.073150512667292,0.00022222222222224812,0.00022222222222224812,0.00022222222222224812,0.07051300237338738,0.00022222222222224812,0.00022222222222224812,0.00022222222222224812,0.14387780478999976,0.00022222222222224812,0.00022222222222224812,0.00022222222222224812,0.00022222222222224812,0.00022222222222224812,0.00022222222222224812,0.00022222222222224812,0.00022222222222224812,0.00022222222222224812,0.00022222222222224812,0.024604286158504206,0.00022222222222224812,0.00022222222222224812,0.00022222222222224812,0.00022222222222224812,0.32325404217431386,0.00022222222222224812,0.00022222222222224812,0.00022222222222224812,0.00022222222222224812,0.012167160393625871,0.02290342433684474,0.30217574070806774,0.00022222222222224812,0.00022222222222224812,0.00022222222222224812,0.00022222222222224812,0.00022222222222224812,0.00022222222222224812,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

Nothing . nada . Lame . Tries way too hard to be creepy and artsy and just landed up being dumb . And that young boy what is up with that ? ? He 's trying to be like the kid in the Sixth Sense ( who was brilliant and totally believable ) . This movie did not scare me . And the idea of people being afraid to use VHS tapes after this ?

56334,4,"Devilishly addictive , but not much payoff This program is evil . It is easy to get sucked into watching Gantz , because of the unique and inexplicable situation that the main characters , who have all died , find themselves in . They have gone to purgatory , and purgatory is like an all - too - real video game . One feels compelled to continue on with the series to begin to answer some of these mysteries . The art direction is decent . Visually , it does n't look cheap . The English voice acting is embarassingly bad , especially the main character , but not as bad as the dialogue , internal and vocalized , that this character has been given to speak . The worst thing about this series , apart from the juvenile humor about breasts and boners , is the "" action "" scenes . These inevitably play out with the people in danger standing around arguing and philosophizing about what to do , when the obvious course of action is to take the guns that are in their hands , and shoot at their alien adversaries like there is no tomorrow . After you witness a few of these frustrating situations on the video , if you do n't feel like banging your head against the wall , you are made of stronger stuff than I. This first set of episodes leaves the viewer with more questions than answers , and more frustration than satisfaction . Save yourself the pain .",259,0,0.00044444444444448474,0.00044444444444448474,0.00044444444444448474,0.00044444444444448474,0.00044444444444448474,0.00044444444444448474,0.00044444444444448474,0.00044444444444448474,0.00044444444444448474,0.00044444444444448474,0.00044444444444448474,0.00044444444444448474,0.00044444444444448474,0.00044444444444448474,0.00044444444444448474,0.00044444444444448474,0.00044444444444448474,0.00044444444444448474,0.00044444444444448474,0.00044444444444448474,0.5163743334888743,0.20703273922185092,0.00044444444444448474,0.04808524755775836,0.00044444444444448474,0.02568730668573182,0.00044444444444448474,0.00044444444444448474,0.00044444444444448474,0.00044444444444448474,0.00044444444444448474,0.00044444444444448474,0.041238828722007174,0.00044444444444448474,0.00044444444444448474,0.00044444444444448474,0.00044444444444448474,0.023688581507183167,0.00044444444444448474,0.00044444444444448474,0.00044444444444448474,0.00044444444444448474,0.00044444444444448474,0.00044444444444448474,0.00044444444444448474,0.0702979553235833,0.04892834082634254,0.00044444444444448474,0.00044444444444448474,0.00044444444444448474,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0
56335,4,"More Gibson garbage ... no stars I would n't normally write a review of such drivel but felt that I had to when I saw what Christiane Schmidt had to say . Now we all know Mr Gibson has got issues with the British ( as well as others ) - just look at that other pile of tosh - Braveheart . But here is an example of why rewriting history to fit your own personal prejudice is dangerous . The usual response is "" It 's not history but Hollywood , it 's fiction based on historical events "" . But the problem is that some people actually believe it really happened like that!Now I 'm sure that many atrocities took place on either side of what was in effect a civil war , but I 've never read of the British burning down churches with people inside - Nazis , yes .... British , no . But who cares about whether it really happened .... it 's only a film!!Good grief , next thing you know they 'll be making a film about the US recovering the first enigma machine ..... oops .",195,0,0.15977191915573058,0.0004545454545454952,0.0004545454545454952,0.0004545454545454952,0.025227812031309135,0.01666237179191955,0.0004545454545454952,0.0004545454545454952,0.0004545454545454952,0.0004545454545454952,0.0004545454545454952,0.0004545454545454952,0.21182538042530868,0.0004545454545454952,0.0004545454545454952,0.0004545454545454952,0.0004545454545454952,0.0004545454545454952,0.0004545454545454952,0.0004545454545454952,0.0004545454545454952,0.0004545454545454952,0.03140648720074923,0.025346116790583437,0.0004545454545454952,0.0004545454545454952,0.0004545454545454952,0.0004545454545454952,0.0004545454545454952,0.0004545454545454952,0.0004545454545454952,0.10280471891262463,0.0004545454545454952,0.0004545454545454952,0.0004545454545454952,0.0004545454545454952,0.0004545454545454952,0.017049212194935055,0.0004545454545454952,0.0004545454545454952,0.0004545454545454952,0.0004545454545454952,0.0004545454545454952,0.1875875654280398,0.20413659788698008,0.0004545454545454952,0.0004545454545454952,0.0004545454545454952,0.0004545454545454952,0.0004545454545454952,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0
56336,4,"Wonderful series , Horrible Idea to re - release like this ... Let me just start by saying that I do n't own "" The Chosen Collection "" but that I do own the original releases of all seven seasons . Why review this then ? Quite frankly , I believe the combined sets to be a waste of money . I have seen the reviews of this set done by fellow reviewers , and it is was my experience that that the boxes for the previous sets are not much different than this - they are as flimsy as this set is , and just as breakable . The set 's discs appear the same as the previous editions , probably a rehash from leftover sets . A bonus disc may be the only redeeming factor , but since I do n't own it , I haver never seen it . I spent my money on "" Buffy the Vampire Slayer "" once , and once is enough for me .

56343,4,"Opt for Something Better I think Denise Austin does a decent job in some of her other videos , but this is n't one of them . She lacks any type of warm up in this one and often looks like she 's just trying to make up steps in order to fill the time slot . The moves are not well choreographed and very awkward . Some may find encouragement in the times Denise gives the camera a bug eyed stare and says "" We 're burning butter .... yeah "" but I found it annoying .

56355,4,"Why Red Dragon Does Not Compare to Silence of the Lambs McCully 1Adam McCully Instructor Lee HobbsENGL 101.02518 November 2005Red Dragon When I heard that Universal Studios was making a prequel to Silence of the Lambs , I 'll admit that I was a little skeptical . Throughout movie history there has been a long list of bad sequels which , more or less , is what this prequel was . Caddyshack II , Godfather III , and Bill and Ted 's Bogus Journey , all horrible follow ups to great films . So naturally I was a little worried that the film Red Dragon was going to be just another flop that followed a great film . Any movie that follows a great film like Silence of the Lambs has a lot to live up to . Personally , I thought that the first sequel to Silence of the Lambs , Hannibal , did n't quite achieve that , and neither did Red Dragon . It was a decent movie , but not quite as shocking and suspenseful as the first . Do n't get me wrong it did have its share of shock value , but since it did n't come first I had already come to expect that . I thought that the writers would take the time and effort to make sure that this film was as good if not better than the first two films , but clearly their work shows otherwise . All in all , this movie disappointed me for several reasons . As I mentioned before , the lack of violence and shock that were so prevalent in the first movie and that I , as a fan of the films , had come to expect . But mostly , it was the fact that this movie was nothing more than a film that was made in the eighties with a different title and better actors . I 've never been a fan of remakes and this film was certainly no exception .",341,0,0.00028985507246380026,0.00028985507246380026,0.00028985507246380026,0.00028985507246380026,0.04403596990068835,0.00028985507246380026,0.00028985507246380026,0.00028985507246380026,0.00028985507246380026,0.00028985507246380026,0.00028985507246380026,0.00028985507246380026,0.09032958478190087,0.00028985507246380026,0.00028985507246380026,0.00028985507246380026,0.00028985507246380026,0.00028985507246380026,0.00028985507246380026,0.00028985507246380026,0.09881542690626421,0.3178988126159324,0.00028985507246380026,0.029435902229829836,0.00028985507246380026,0.00028985507246380026,0.00028985507246380026,0.00028985507246380026,0.00028985507246380026,0.00028985507246380026,0.00028985507246380026,0.0225212722710715,0.00028985507246380026,0.00028985507246380026,0.02490049362895081,0.00028985507246380026,0.00028985507246380026,0.00028985507246380026,0.00028985507246380026,0.00028985507246380026,0.00028985507246380026,0.00028985507246380026,0.00028985507246380026,0.264165146704217,0.09601333299012946,0.00028985507246380026,0.00028985507246380026,0.00028985507246380026,0.00028985507246380026,0.00028985507246380026,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0
56358,4,"Zzzzzzzzzzzz Let me just preface my review with the fact that some of my favorite movies are incredibly slow and even "" boring "" to my friends . So it is n't the glacial pace of this movie that so bothered me . It is n't the unresolved ending that bothered me . It was n't the violence ( in short bursts . ) It was n't the acting ( the acting was pretty good actually ) . But as a whole this movie was simply a tremendous failure . I did n't care who was sending the tapes and I did n't care what would happen with the main characters . They were unrelatable on just about any level . This movie is the kind where you will see a remotely interesting twist in the plot about 3/4 's of the way in and you 'll think , "" wow I wonder where the story will go next "" . And then it does n't . That was it . Very disappointing . I do n't mind excruciatingly slow films as long as there 's SOME kinda payoff in the end .

56363,4,"A Little Too Mean For Its Own Good Kelly Preston and Tcheky Karyo are a New York City couple who come together after Preston leaves Matthew Broderick and Karyo uses Meg Ryan in order to get a Visa . Now Broderick and Ryan are teaming up to get even with their ex 's . The problem is , the offenses they 've endured ( being dumped and being used ) do n't really warrant the horrible things they do to these two people , especially Karyo . Which is probably why first - time director Griffin Dunne used two such amiable stars in the feature roles . After all , how can we not root for Ferris Bueller and Harry 's Sally ? Unfortunately , it ends up being pretty easy not to root for them when their revenge is so excessive , the pace of the film is so uneven , and the script is n't particularly funny . There 's a difference between black comedy and just mean - spirited comedy . Despite a handful of amusing moments and a few nice cinematic touches , this film does not walk that line very well",196,0,0.0004878048780488303,0.10092179244652015,0.0004878048780488303,0.0004878048780488303,0.0004878048780488303,0.0004878048780488303,0.0004878048780488303,0.0004878048780488303,0.0004878048780488303,0.0004878048780488303,0.0004878048780488303,0.0004878048780488303,0.14865355334185942,0.0004878048780488303,0.0004878048780488303,0.0004878048780488303,0.0004878048780488303,0.0004878048780488303,0.0004878048780488303,0.0004878048780488303,0.17876882973205765,0.2290824561532048,0.019663030028221794,0.0004878048780488303,0.0004878048780488303,0.0004878048780488303,0.0004878048780488303,0.0004878048780488303,0.0004878048780488303,0.0004878048780488303,0.0004878048780488303,0.0004878048780488303,0.0004878048780488303,0.0004878048780488303,0.0004878048780488303,0.026884288635645487,0.0004878048780488303,0.0004878048780488303,0.0004878048780488303,0.0004878048780488303,0.0004878048780488303,0.0004878048780488303,0.0004878048780488303,0.1662278352157969,0.0004878048780488303,0.0004878048780488303,0.10931040956864302,0.0004878048780488303,0.0004878048780488303,0.0004878048780488303,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0

While the movie itself was funny and an overall good movie , I hated it because it was absolutley nothing like the book .

56387,4,"Hard people to like . The film has its amusing and even touching points , but not very many . The big problem with RH is that neither Ford or Benning are sympathetic characters .

He 's arrogant even with a gun pointed at him , and the fact that it takes a bullet in his brain to even make him consider acting human is , if you think about it , appalling . And his wife is , in a way , even worse ; she accepts his character so she can have all the material things it buys and status is provides .

56388,4,"Amatuer Camera Man . Love Michael Buble , but this was more like a home made movie of someone using their camcorder from the audience . Parts of Michael 's head was cut off , and then ; sometimes , his whole head was cut off . Most of the time , the camera man did n't expect where Michael was going to move to and you 'll get a jerky movement of the camera man trying to get Michael back into the picture . I wish they would have said in the description that this was more of a documentary than a concert . That this was just home made videos . This was definitely not worth $ 20 . If you want a professional quality concert , I would recommend buying Michael Buble 's Caught in the Act . Caught in the Act was worth the $ 20 bucks . You get professional camera men who anticipated Michael 's movements , and parts of his head was never cut off like Come Fly with Me 's DVD . Also , the sound quality on Caught in the Act was way better . Now , I understand why some places sold Come Fly with Me DVD 's and had the word enhanced after it . The DVD that I received was not enhanced .

56438,4,"desperation Controversy courted the release of this film and people went to see it for the actual depictions of sex between the actors , thinking somehow it would be pornographic or titillating . But this film showed two desperate , middle - aged strangers ( with all their flaws abundantly clear ) meeting once a week for no - strings - attached encounters . The fact that the audience sees graphic moments adds only to the "" desperate "" , tawdry , pathetic feel of their relationship . Naturally , one of the two of them becomes too curious and wants to know more about the other partner , one of the greatest pitfalls in the dangerous pursuit of anonymous encounters : sooner or later , anonymity is not good enough anymore .",133,0,0.30635664669076057,0.0010526315789474632,0.0010526315789474632,0.1103875042093153,0.0010526315789474632,0.0010526315789474632,0.0010526315789474632,0.0010526315789474632,0.0010526315789474632,0.0010526315789474632,0.0010526315789474632,0.0010526315789474632,0.0010526315789474632,0.0010526315789474632,0.0010526315789474632,0.0010526315789474632,0.0010526315789474632,0.0010526315789474632,0.0010526315789474632,0.0010526315789474632,0.0010526315789474632,0.0010526315789474632,0.0010526315789474632,0.0010526315789474632,0.0010526315789474632,0.0010526315789474632,0.05527991473063908,0.0010526315789474632,0.0010526315789474632,0.0010526315789474632,0.0010526315789474632,0.0010526315789474632,0.0010526315789474632,0.0010526315789474632,0.0010526315789474632,0.053812512976481056,0.0010526315789474632,0.0010526315789474632,0.0010526315789474632,0.0010526315789474632,0.0010526315789474632,0.0010526315789474632,0.0010526315789474632,0.4267950003401683,0.0010526315789474632,0.0010526315789474632,0.0010526315789474632,0.0010526315789474632,0.0010526315789474632,0.0010526315789474632,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1
56439,4,"Some Laughs , But No Real Heart--""Just Friends "" Just Does n't Cut It Comedy comes in many forms -- everything from crude slapstick to subtle satire -- and in "" Just Friends "" there is an uneasy fusion of two classic movie types . First , the movie wants to be a gross - out comedy . The sight gags are plentiful , the physical comedy abundant and often cruel , and the dialogue absurdly unrealistic . However , the movie also wants to be taken seriously as a typical romantic comedy -- the variation where two people are meant to be together but various situations have kept them apart . These elements have been combined successfully in the past--""There 's Something About Mary "" jumps right to mind . Here , we get something far less successful . First , the good news . There are legitimate laughs to be had in "" Just Friends "" and that was a pleasant surprise . If you do n't care about character development and just want inane humor , you could do worse than this movie . And if the sight of Ryan Reynolds in a fat suit sounds like the height of hilarity to you -- check this out right away . Sadly , it 's the romantic comedy angle that fails to ignite . There is nothing real at stake here to care about -- and the blame for this falls squarely on Reynolds ' character ( I 'll use the word character lightly here ) . Reynolds may be one of our greatest sitcom actors working -- the problem , however , is that he 's not in sitcoms anymore . He 's making movies , unfortunately -- and his hamming up to the camera always seem to take the place of a real character . Here , he plays a celebrity insider -- a successful , trendy record executive . And yet , he 's not believable as trendy , successful or professional . His character vacillates between being the a villain and a hero , you never know or understand him -- he just does whatever is necessary to set up the next gag . It 's too bad , really , because Amy Smart -- as his love interest -- IS playing a character . I 'm not usually a fan , but here she does nicely and the movie lets her down . But it 's Anna Faris that I 'm going to single out for the most inspired performance . The funniest bits to me revolve around her character -- a shallow , insane pop star . Sure , it 's an easy target -- but she throws herself into the role with such hilarious , over - the - top gusto that she is easily a cast standout . Again , some humor -- no emotion . If you do n't expect much from your comedy , you might just like this . The fatal flaw for me is that I felt this film wanted me to care about the central relationship , but did n't do anything to make it REAL .",532,0,0.00020202020202022023,0.00020202020202022023,0.00020202020202022023,0.00020202020202022023,0.00020202020202022023,0.00020202020202022023,0.00020202020202022023,0.00020202020202022023,0.00020202020202022023,0.00020202020202022023,0.00020202020202022023,0.00020202020202022023,0.00020202020202022023,0.00020202020202022023,0.00020202020202022023,0.00020202020202022023,0.08361103261970276,0.00020202020202022023,0.00020202020202022023,0.00020202020202022023,0.8159084605308005,0.00020202020202022023,0.00020202020202022023,0.00020202020202022023,0.00020202020202022023,0.02190237186724537,0.00020202020202022023,0.00020202020202022023,0.00020202020202022023,0.00020202020202022023,0.00020202020202022023,0.00020202020202022023,0.035674561493777485,0.00020202020202022023,0.00020202020202022023,0.00020202020202022023,0.00020202020202022023,0.00020202020202022023,0.00020202020202022023,0.00020202020202022023,0.00020202020202022023,0.00020202020202022023,0.00020202020202022023,0.00020202020202022023,0.00020202020202022023,0.00020202020202022023,0.033812664397564036,0.00020202020202022023,0.00020202020202022023,0.00020202020202022023,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

First off , it is outdated and that is annoying with the annoying music- but the background exercisers really bug me too . Not only that , the moves are strange . She does a lot of shoulder work moving back and forth with her feet to the beat of the cheesy music . I found my neck hurt A LOT after that . The leg section would be good if there was another way to position yourself . The ab section too was so old school , I was hoping to find some new exercises .

56449,4,"Not so sure about this one . . . When I was looking for a fitness DVD for me and my two oldest children ( girls , ages 3 1/2 and 2 ) to do together , I was impressed with the reviews of this DVD and it sounded intriguing . Though I was n't really willing to shell out 16 bucks quite yet , so we rented it from Netflixs to try it out first . As adults my husband and I were really turned off by the "" animated "" bear , though our girls liked him . Another thing that I was n't really impressed with was the camera was at times only focusing on Kristi Dear 's face or the animated bear and it was hard for me and our girls to follow exactly what moves she was doing when . We had to run through the DVD a second time to really get the routine . The total time of the DVD is 30 minutes , but only about 20 - 22 minutes of that is actual warm - up or workout time . The rest is filler about why we need to exercise and eat healthy foods and snacks , which is fine to watch for the first time or two , but then I found myself fast forwarding through it to get to the workout sections . Which if I had to do that every single time I watched it with my girls , I would get annoyed really fast . My husband really did not think it was worth 16 dollars , he 'd be willing to spend maybe 5 - 7 dollars on it , but no more . I gave the DVD 2 stars because Kristi Dear really does a good job of communicating with kids , has a pleasant voice , and demonstrates easy moves and routines for kids to do .

56508,4,"Euuuwww ...... Creepy ! This movie creeped me out and not in a good way . Johnny Depp is an awesome actor and I usually find him sexy but in THIS stinker I find him really creepy and gross . Maybe it 's the Michael Jackson - ish look he has going on with the black wig and white face . Could they have picked a more horrible look for WW ? It looked like they took him to a costume store and put a 10 $ wig and 5 $ clown makup on him ! I love Tim Burton 's other movies but this one sucked BIGTIME ! It gives a new perspective on Willy Wonka but this Willy is someone I would keep kids AWAY from . This movie is childish if you 're an adult and pales compared to the original . If you 're a kid it 's way too dark and scary and has some adult humor which will leave kids asking "" Auntie Zoe , what does that mean ? "" When are screenwriters going to figure it out ? EITHER WRITE A KIDS MOVIE OR WRITE A GROWNUP MOVIE ! ! ! It 's really hard to do both in the same film . It seems like when writers try to make movies that appeal to adults and kids , they end up appealing to nobody ! Maybe I am biased because I loved the original Gene Wilder version . I would have been open to seeing a remake if it was GOOD but this movie was dissapointing . It 's amazing how so much money and effort go into special effects and expensive sets and the script itself is hollow with lousy characters . The whole thing just had a creepy vibe with almost sadistic undertones . The only reason I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 is because I love Depp and Burton , if you are not a fan of either , do n't waste your time with this steaming pile of poo !",345,0,0.00027027027027029684,0.00027027027027029684,0.00027027027027029684,0.00027027027027029684,0.00027027027027029684,0.08449068694299057,0.0436100881838121,0.00027027027027029684,0.02130443789524981,0.00027027027027029684,0.00027027027027029684,0.00027027027027029684,0.00027027027027029684,0.00027027027027029684,0.00027027027027029684,0.00027027027027029684,0.00027027027027029684,0.00027027027027029684,0.00027027027027029684,0.00027027027027029684,0.6605912366627378,0.00027027027027029684,0.00027027027027029684,0.00027027027027029684,0.00027027027027029684,0.028956383818891037,0.00027027027027029684,0.00027027027027029684,0.00027027027027029684,0.00027027027027029684,0.00027027027027029684,0.00027027027027029684,0.00027027027027029684,0.00027027027027029684,0.00027027027027029684,0.03572464015774756,0.00027027027027029684,0.00027027027027029684,0.00027027027027029684,0.058553042001380014,0.00027027027027029684,0.00027027027027029684,0.00027027027027029684,0.00027027027027029684,0.05541813298583861,0.00027027027027029684,0.00027027027027029684,0.00027027027027029684,0.00027027027027029684,0.00027027027027029684,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

All the PBS ... and viewers like your rubbish ? Where 'd that come from . It was totallly funded via the BBC . The PBS editions mess up may have been funded by someone else .

56565,4,"Head In The Clouds Is A Very Appropriate Title For This Movie Charlize Theron , her real life boyfriend Stuart Townsend , and Penelope Cruz are all nice to look at , and have at times shown considerable tlane in their work , Theron having won as Osca for her role in Monster . But Head In The Clouds is one of those beautifully filmed films starring a beautiful cast that trying to stay beautiful in an increasingly ugly world , particularly Europe in the 1930s . From the Spanish Civil War to World War II , the stories of these three people who share a Paris flat together is supposed to be a sweeping tragedy that shows how world events and fate can conspire to thwart true love . Instead , it shows how silly things can be when you mix hedonism , narcissism , social responsbility , and sheer stupidity . You end up caring less about the characters , andwondering more how much more trouble will they get themselves in .

56574,4,"TREMENDOUS DISAPPOINTMENT !

I did n't even care to test the rest of the disc and just returned it .",130,0,0.0006451612903226229,0.0006451612903226229,0.0006451612903226229,0.1942295695877716,0.0006451612903226229,0.0006451612903226229,0.0006451612903226229,0.0006451612903226229,0.271361118379707,0.0006451612903226229,0.037526579248545744,0.0006451612903226229,0.1195337159384509,0.0006451612903226229,0.0006451612903226229,0.0006451612903226229,0.0006451612903226229,0.13320542366630103,0.0006451612903226229,0.0006451612903226229,0.0006451612903226229,0.0006451612903226229,0.0006451612903226229,0.0006451612903226229,0.0006451612903226229,0.0006451612903226229,0.0006451612903226229,0.0006451612903226229,0.0006451612903226229,0.0006451612903226229,0.0006451612903226229,0.0006451612903226229,0.0006451612903226229,0.0006451612903226229,0.07307128536285788,0.034869644845477096,0.0006451612903226229,0.0006451612903226229,0.0006451612903226229,0.0006451612903226229,0.10910588877733866,0.0006451612903226229,0.0006451612903226229,0.0006451612903226229,0.0006451612903226229,0.0006451612903226229,0.0006451612903226229,0.0006451612903226229,0.0006451612903226229,0.0006451612903226229,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

56595,4,"Postmodern American Teenyboppers meet Shaka Zulu Well , this was about as formulaically politically correct as a movie can get , unfortunately : the female teenage protagonist ( played by Witherspoon , whose acting powers have increased dramatically since her stilted acting here ) acts masculine and heroic , the male teenage protagonist acts craven and flippant . At one ridiculous point , the girl runs around acting like a commando , a veritable one - gal army , blowing up the bad guys , while the boy hides in a cave sniveling . Later , when the boy tries to assert himself by offering to carry the gal 's backpack as they cross a desert , the gal snaps at him , Bella Abzug - style , and walks quickly ahead , leaving him in the dust . Clearly a modern radical feminist thing going on here , and what is most unfortunate is that this movie was made for a young audience and therefore is in keeping with the modern radical feminist propaganda which is brainwashing young women into unnaturally behaving like men . Of course , in the real world , the result for such manly girls , once they become women , is that men do not choose them and they remain alone , and therefore become bitter -- ironically and inevitably blaming men , of course . In this movie , the wimpy teenage guy falls for the brassy , masculine gal -- but that 's why they call them movies . When are these post - modern writers , artists , and other culture - shapers with an agenda going to realize that when they tout modern radical feminism , they are touting something unnatural -- men simply do not prefer masculine females . Men want someone to COMPLEMENT them , not COMPETE with them . Men crave FEMININITY in females , not FEMINISM . Wow , is there ever a difference in those two forms of comportment ! This poor teenage guy depicted in this movie , at least his character does progress a little bit : by the end of the movie , instead of craven and flippant , he graduates to something akin to a metrosexual - type with a wild - boy haircut , if that is even a step upward . But the plucky gal -- she 's still the one in charge in this fictitious world of upside - down gender relations . Uh , another problem with this movie -- and there are many -- is when the kids are going through the Kalahari Desert , something which should be , and for a time is here depicted as , a foreboding and life - threatening task . Yet we see Witherspoon in this desert frolicking with a dog ; and we see the boy 's flippancy and joviality emerge in a totally out - of - place manner , considering the dire situation they are in . The sense of urgency which had been built up is totally excreted away by these light - hearted , inane scenes . Look , I dig Disney kid movies -- more realistic ones . You know , old style Disney movies . You take "" Old Yeller "" for example . Now there was a quality kid movie , and quite true to life . This movie was not . It had a plastic , spoiled - American - materialistic - teenybopper feel throughout . Disney has gone down the tubes . In any number of ways , they 've been subverted by radical Marxist agendas ( Note : One more of these was the fact that an African Bushman was allowed to evince a pagan ritual from his PC pagan religion -- something called "" tapping , "" while the Caucasians were of course not shown evincing any sign of their un - PC Judeo - Christian religion -- this is bias , folks , leftwing , PC bias , same as the aforementioned feminist bilge ) . I am learning to run , not walk , away from Disney stuff , and this movie was further cause for me to do so .",706,0,0.00019607843137256766,0.047061188265132343,0.019042591733216502,0.00019607843137256766,0.00019607843137256766,0.01615089859337395,0.00019607843137256766,0.27526772684250594,0.00019607843137256766,0.00019607843137256766,0.00019607843137256766,0.00019607843137256766,0.00019607843137256766,0.00019607843137256766,0.00019607843137256766,0.00019607843137256766,0.00019607843137256766,0.00019607843137256766,0.00019607843137256766,0.00019607843137256766,0.4618156068877118,0.00019607843137256766,0.00019607843137256766,0.00019607843137256766,0.04848851334514429,0.00019607843137256766,0.012799866587290992,0.00019607843137256766,0.00019607843137256766,0.00019607843137256766,0.00019607843137256766,0.024232573730066355,0.00019607843137256766,0.00019607843137256766,0.00019607843137256766,0.00019607843137256766,0.00019607843137256766,0.00019607843137256766,0.00019607843137256766,0.014121428488085412,0.00019607843137256766,0.00019607843137256766,0.00019607843137256766,0.00019607843137256766,0.07317646827256985,0.00019607843137256766,0.00019607843137256766,0.00019607843137256766,0.00019607843137256766,0.00019607843137256766,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

56611,4,"Truth , Justice = deadbeat dad peeping tom ? There are two main reasons why this Superman film fails to fly inspite of the special effects . What Singer and company have missed is the heart of Superman - virtues . The ideal of the American way ( noticably absent ) is supposed to go hand in hand with truth and justice . Donner made the mistake in the 70 's of having Superman sleep with Lois , and now Singer adds insult to injury by having Superman discover he has an illegitmate child that he does n't take responsibility for ( deadbeat dad ) . Using his super powers to invade the privacy of Lois in her home , drags Superman down to the level of creepy ( peeping tom).The second issue concerns personality . Routh and Bosworth look nice but have no charm and no chemistry . These are the two ingredients that made Reeves and Kidder so endearing . A new director , writers , and cast is needed .

56616,4,""" Family Values "" dreck Cinema - wise , you know you 're witnessing the beginning of the end when the best Hollywood can come up with is a SEQUEL to a REMAKE ( it`s not often that two crimes of unoriginality are committed in a single film ) . But that is exactly what "" Cheaper by the Dozen 2 "" turns out to be - and the result , quality - wise , is pretty much what one would expect . This is one of those alleged family comedies in which the adults ( the male adults at any rate ) are infinitely more immature in their attitude and behavior than the children they are raising . Steve Martin returns as the prolific father of twelve who is beginning to sense that his children , as they are growing older , no longer want to spend quality time together as a family . To rectify the situation , he takes them all on a vacation to a favorite lake resort - a move that threatens to turn into a full - scale disaster when the Bakers find themselves embroiled in a fierce competition with a neighboring family of snooty overachievers led by Eugene Levy , a patriarch who runs his brood with so much spit - and - polish regimentation that he makes Captain Von Trapp look like a touchy - feely pushover in comparison . One might be tempted to call this a distended version of a "" Brady Bunch "" episode and leave it at that , but even that show , for all its lack of sophistication , did n't portray the father as a total and irredeemable doofus with serious developmental issues and the emotional maturity of a bratty six - year - old . Besides the daddy - is - a - dope stereotype , all "" Cheaper by the Dozen 2 "" has to offer is lame slapstick , a silly pre - pubescent "" Romeo and Juliet "" subplot , and push - button scenes of emotional uplift in which a crescendo of swelling violins serves as the cue for the tears to start flowing . The drearily unoriginal screenplay comes replete with the requisite dog - humping incidents and poop jokes , and not one but TWO scenes of an elderly handicapped gentleman rolling off into the lake in a wheelchair . Any more of these films and Planned Parenthood wo n't have to mount a fundraising drive for years to come",422,0,0.17131910907774286,0.0003921568627451495,0.043393904384704106,0.0003921568627451495,0.0003921568627451495,0.0003921568627451495,0.0003921568627451495,0.0003921568627451495,0.02284498214506152,0.0003921568627451495,0.0003921568627451495,0.0003921568627451495,0.0003921568627451495,0.0003921568627451495,0.0003921568627451495,0.0003921568627451495,0.0003921568627451495,0.0003921568627451495,0.0003921568627451495,0.0003921568627451495,0.0003921568627451495,0.11386281386371727,0.0003921568627451495,0.05557969236834085,0.0003921568627451495,0.0003921568627451495,0.0003921568627451495,0.0003921568627451495,0.0003921568627451495,0.0003921568627451495,0.0003921568627451495,0.0003921568627451495,0.0003921568627451495,0.0003921568627451495,0.1735357560375997,0.01984322357151036,0.0003921568627451495,0.0003921568627451495,0.0003921568627451495,0.0003921568627451495,0.04661986624758856,0.06054097532201192,0.0003921568627451495,0.18027115311094796,0.0003921568627451495,0.09689440622371397,0.0003921568627451495,0.0003921568627451495,0.0003921568627451495,0.0003921568627451495,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0
56618,4,"A goody - goody propaganda video This is a "" goody - goody "" Ronald Reagan propaganda style film . By that I mean that it tries to portray the US as the good guys being hit by the bad ones . It does n't say what dirty role the US CIA had in birthing the whole horrible genie of fundamentalis Islam , how it set up , equipped and nurtured not only Bin Laden and his Al - Qaeda , but a whole bunch of other loathsome Islamic terror outfits now stalking the globe - like the Islamic Brotherhood and the Taliban for instance : all just to defeat the USSR , and gain access to hydrocarbon rich regions , to fuel the greedy American consumerist lifestyle which US citizens take so much for granted . I am not a "" conspiracy theorist "" ; these people are usually an absurd breed , going off at the other extreme tangent . I live in Peshawar , the hotbed of CIA mischief in the 1980s and 90s ( and even now ) , and the area where I live - the University Town - housed all the actors on this stage : the US officials and spies , their clubs , the Afghan "" Mujahideen "" leaders ' houses , etc . etc ... I grew up seeing all this going on literally next door , and so would like to apprise my American friends of the unpleasant truth . The National Geographic and the Reader 's Digest magazines are two long established icons of US media culture that have served as the unofficial ( and therefore hard to suspect ) mouthpieces of some of the most outrageous US propaganda drives ... Never trust their political commentaries , although their articles about polar bears and planets can be very nice ..",311,0,0.0006060606060606684,0.0006060606060606684,0.0006060606060606684,0.0006060606060606684,0.0006060606060606684,0.0006060606060606684,0.0006060606060606684,0.0006060606060606684,0.0006060606060606684,0.0006060606060606684,0.0006060606060606684,0.0006060606060606684,0.0006060606060606684,0.0006060606060606684,0.0006060606060606684,0.0006060606060606684,0.12927293528625328,0.0006060606060606684,0.0006060606060606684,0.0006060606060606684,0.4557690211695937,0.0006060606060606684,0.0006060606060606684,0.0006060606060606684,0.0006060606060606684,0.031815012929383366,0.0006060606060606684,0.0006060606060606684,0.0006060606060606684,0.0006060606060606684,0.0006060606060606684,0.06121212121289852,0.0006060606060606684,0.0006060606060606684,0.0006060606060606684,0.0006060606060606684,0.049532018980553684,0.0006060606060606684,0.0006060606060606684,0.0006060606060606684,0.0006060606060606684,0.0006060606060606684,0.0006060606060606684,0.0006060606060606684,0.0006060606060606684,0.24573222375464795,0.0006060606060606684,0.0006060606060606684,0.0006060606060606684,0.0006060606060606684,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
56626,4,"Only for Kiefer This is a surprisingly poor movie . Although it has some well - known actors , and a notable director , the material was just presented badly and predictably - like a lousy late night TV - movie with profanity inserted to liven it up . The movie makes a simplified joke of the legal system and its sterotypical failings ( though legitimate in many cases ) . It also glosses over the grieving process of the family , ignores the normal safety warnings to the remaining child , overdoes Kiefer Sutherland 's character flaws ( which are considerable nevertheless ) , and generally oversimplifies everything into a neat package to which you already know the ending because of the spoiler title . In one particularly - bad scene , after taking martial arts classes and other measures to prepare herself mentally and physically , Sally 's character simply stares open - mouthed and dumbfounded at Keifer 's character when they meet on the street and he talks to her . I do n't know what I missed that the 4- and 5-star reviewers like so much . I only see wide - spread mediocrity . I would only recommend this for fans of Keifer .

56642,4,"Only if your a Prince Fan In the early 1990 's this movie was definitely made for that era . Just look at the clothing and hair . High top fades etc . Graffiti Bridge was definitely unique . It should have been released on cable t.v . instead of the theater . It was more of a musical then a actual movie . Prince somehow has his own ways of doing things in his own world . And he may not care about record sales or what people think of what he puts out , but it makes even the most loyal fans question what he is doing . The talent he has is amazing but he 's become just a mediocur artist . This lack luster film may be remembered a hundred years from now . But as of now it 's just what you call a get up and walk out film . I 'm a prince fanatic , a die hard fan , but man the potential this guy has to be a mega star of our time he fails to meet . You haft to make people believe in you and really reach them and relate . If only Prince could relate to what people are feeling now and what they want . Prince somehow fell behind because the youth of this generation moved on while he stayed stagnet . I think he shut the world out and it just went on turning . Record sales may not matter to him , but fans you must keep loyal . Graffiti bridge is a film in my collection and I just look at it as my collection but nothing more . It 's a film that makes you think . It 's spiritual and there are some warm moments . Now Purple Rain is something not to be missed . I recommend that one .

56658,4,"Dark drama that does not end well The biggest draw for me in anime is an engaging plotline that really makes you think in new directions . Witch Hunter Robin was recommended to me by a fellow lover of the more serious type of anime . I did n't like it ; I found the plotline to be predictable and forced with a ' so - that's - it ? ' ending I hated . The animation is top quality with lots of dark tones and the music is appropriately spooky . Good visuals do n't make up for bad story though . This serious drama geared is towards adults , and not children .

56687,4,"Relieved I 'm Not The Only One Who Feels This Way After seeing the real show in L.A. , my girlfriend and I were really looking forward to the DVD . And after last night 's viewing , I went to bed kinda creeped out and actually felt a little guilty that I did n't like the whole thing that much . I 'm relieved to see that other fans just could n't handle all the audience shots either . This DVD tries so hard to define Paul 's place in our lives and his impact on the world through his music that it ends up blowing it for those of us who already know , feel , and live it . They tried to document his music and its impact instead of just filming it . If you 're from Mars and this is your first day on Earth , you might appreciate the way the DVD attempts to explain the relevance of Paul 's work . If you 've been on this planet for awhile , chances are you 're already up to speed and just want to see the band and hear the music",197,0,0.00048780487804882125,0.00048780487804882125,0.00048780487804882125,0.00048780487804882125,0.00048780487804882125,0.00048780487804882125,0.00048780487804882125,0.2241271302679809,0.00048780487804882125,0.00048780487804882125,0.00048780487804882125,0.00048780487804882125,0.3333646947186679,0.00048780487804882125,0.00048780487804882125,0.00048780487804882125,0.07547000136479573,0.12847735362241106,0.00048780487804882125,0.00048780487804882125,0.00048780487804882125,0.00048780487804882125,0.00048780487804882125,0.028445421036291548,0.00048780487804882125,0.00048780487804882125,0.00048780487804882125,0.00048780487804882125,0.07711376469930725,0.00048780487804882125,0.00048780487804882125,0.00048780487804882125,0.00048780487804882125,0.00048780487804882125,0.11202602453444639,0.00048780487804882125,0.00048780487804882125,0.00048780487804882125,0.00048780487804882125,0.00048780487804882125,0.00048780487804882125,0.00048780487804882125,0.00048780487804882125,0.00048780487804882125,0.00048780487804882125,0.00048780487804882125,0.00048780487804882125,0.00048780487804882125,0.00048780487804882125,0.00048780487804882125,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

56704,4,"Buy only the first set ... The first set was very entertaining -- a spy / crime caper spoof with dashes of comic brilliance provided by Moore and Curtis -- Set II is another kettle of fish altogether . The second set is strictly played for laughs -- there is little or no character development and the plots and dialogue run rather thin . Frankly , I hoped for more . For those who wish to obtain a true collector 's set of this highly entertaining series , would do better to purchase the Network DVD Megaset Special Edition of The Persuaders , now available thru AmazonUK with some delighful extras including bumpers , promotional materials , episode commentaries , tv spot interviews , title sequences , and hour - long interviews with director , Robert Baker , Tony Curtis , and Roger Moore . Tony Curtis ' unabashed comments regarding the production team , guest - star Joan Collins 's antics on the set , and his marijuana bust en route to London for the taping of the first episode , are absolutely priceless in this Network DVD set . Surprisingly , the acute observer will notice that some of the episodes in the second box of the A E set are written by none other than Terry Nation -- who would go on to pen a bigger and more serious series SURVIVORS in the UK four years later - when will that be available in the US ?",250,0,0.0004444444444444938,0.0004444444444444938,0.0004444444444444938,0.0004444444444444938,0.0004444444444444938,0.0004444444444444938,0.023060915403295256,0.0004444444444444938,0.0004444444444444938,0.0004444444444444938,0.0004444444444444938,0.022666666666667043,0.0004444444444444938,0.0004444444444444938,0.0004444444444444938,0.0004444444444444938,0.0004444444444444938,0.12247859361720957,0.0004444444444444938,0.0004444444444444938,0.0004444444444444938,0.0004444444444444938,0.0004444444444444938,0.09464754853412895,0.0004444444444444938,0.2694092376139985,0.09295559994467055,0.0004444444444444938,0.0004444444444444938,0.0004444444444444938,0.0004444444444444938,0.0004444444444444938,0.0004444444444444938,0.0004444444444444938,0.0004444444444444938,0.047784786137236766,0.0004444444444444938,0.0004444444444444938,0.0004444444444444938,0.027468185074848397,0.054244285980676134,0.0004444444444444938,0.0004444444444444938,0.227506403249489,0.0004444444444444938,0.0004444444444444938,0.0004444444444444938,0.0004444444444444938,0.0004444444444444938,0.0004444444444444938,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

56715,4,"Does not do the book justice Wuthering Heights the novel grabs you at the first page and drags you through passion , betrayal , madness , despair , greed , hatred , and revenge . It 's not necessarily a pleasant read , but always an engrossing one . Emily Bronte 's characters jump off the page and will continue to haunt you long after you 've finished the book . Modern day moviemakers have had a notoriously bad time translating any of the Bronte sisters ' works into film and this is no exception . The characters are representations in name only and fail to capture any of the true spirit behind this amazing book . Juliet Binoche and Ralph Fiennes are two of the best actors working in film today , but this movie is a definite low point for both . As Heathcliff and Catherine , Fiennes and Binoche seem to have failed to grasp the depth or the passions of the characters and their performances are flat and bland . Binoche 's personality is too grounded and mature for the wild and carefree Cathy so she compensates with endless giggling that got on my nerves . Fiennes comes across as greasy and sullen instead of a tormented and complex soul ; he simply does not have the charisma or the depth to play such a demanding role . The other characters are likewise lacking in realism , only Janet McTeer fares well , she is fabulous as Ellen Dean . Even if the acting were better , the story does not capture the essence of the book . Everything moves too quickly , the film jumps around frequently and large plot holes are left either unexplained or are patched quickly with a few brusque words . Sinead O'Conner 's appearance as Emily Bronte to bookend the film is contrived and unnecessary . This film was very obviously made on a budget and the sets and costumes show it . The wigs are dreadful and the costumes are for the most part , ugly and unflattering . Fiennes actually looks potbellied in some of his vests ! Maybe someday someone will make a film that does this remarkable book justice .

Then why is still in one piece . This time round , the government realise there 's nothing they can do to stop Jason and have him captured . He is cryogenically frozen so he can come to no harm . Unfortunatley , he and a doctor stay that way for over 400 years and reside in space ! Yes space ! The budget for this movie was impressive and the special effects are indeed good . There may be more elaborate death scenes and a high body count but it 's just not enough !

While Freddy Vs Jason was indeed impressive , there is absolutely no way either killer can survive a film on their own anymore",201,0,0.19129737720473905,0.07846141383333705,0.0005263157894737336,0.0005263157894737336,0.059353329714675586,0.0005263157894737336,0.06089980550991779,0.0005263157894737336,0.0005263157894737336,0.0005263157894737336,0.0005263157894737336,0.0005263157894737336,0.0005263157894737336,0.0005263157894737336,0.052678142506728094,0.0005263157894737336,0.0005263157894737336,0.0005263157894737336,0.0005263157894737336,0.0005263157894737336,0.19921966118211212,0.0005263157894737336,0.0005263157894737336,0.0005263157894737336,0.0005263157894737336,0.0005263157894737336,0.0005263157894737336,0.0005263157894737336,0.0005263157894737336,0.0005263157894737336,0.0005263157894737336,0.0005263157894737336,0.1711398098373033,0.0005263157894737336,0.0005263157894737336,0.034551003699254616,0.0005263157894737336,0.0005263157894737336,0.02829711470323392,0.0005263157894737336,0.041448667577336604,0.0005263157894737336,0.0005263157894737336,0.062127358441886146,0.0005263157894737336,0.0005263157894737336,0.0005263157894737336,0.0005263157894737336,0.0005263157894737336,0.0005263157894737336,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

56757,4,Artsy flop Next to A Night At the Roxbury ( another Will Ferrell zero ) this is the worst movie I 've ever seen . So maudlin and it dragged on and on and on . It could actually make the viewer pray for death to end the torture so I guess it has some authenticity . Brad Pitt 's particularly bad - one facial expression ( blank ) and a painful monotone delivery . I think he got some award aptly represented by a carved WOODEN statue of Keanu Reeves . Mr. Brangelina Jolie looks awful next to a brilliant thespian like Anthony Hopkins .

56789,4,"For cinemasochists only Bearing in mind that the 50 MOVIE PACK line is what it is , no - frills packages of public - domain films , I have to say that SCI FI CLASSICS is not up to the level of MYSTERY CLASSICS and HORROR CLASSICS , which I also own . I 've watched everything in the MYSTERY and HORROR sets , and , while the latter is padded with flicks that properly belong in the former , I did n't feel cheated by either . Moreover , some of the films included , such as DETOUR , IMPACT , BLUEBEARD , and TOO LATE FOR TEARS , actually are classics of a sort , deserving of repeated viewings . Only about 36 of the 50 films included in SCI FI CLASSICS remotely qualify as science fiction or even as "" sci fi "" -- and the only "" classics "" among them are famous ( or infamous ) anti - masterpieces on the order of ROBOT MONSTER , TEENAGERS FROM OUTER SPACE , MESA OF LOST WOMEN , and SANTA CLAUS CONQUERS THE MARTIANS ; the balance comprises sword - and - sandal strongman epics , e.g. , HERCULES AND THE TYRANT OF BABYLON , and jungle epics , e.g. , WHITE PONGO , QUEEN OF THE AMAZONS , and Clyde Beatty 's LOST JUNGLE . If you simply must have copies of low - budget programmers such as UNKNOWN WORLD , HORRORS OF SPIDER ISLAND , and THE INCREDIBLE PETRIFIED WORLD on hand for those occasions when THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL does n't ring your chimes , you 'll like this package .

56791,4,"Low Quality Sword and Sandal Movie Delmer Daves ' mediocre direction of the sequel to the equally pathetic film "" The Robe "" starring Richard Burton . A totally contrived film that demonstrates no competence in either screenplay , direction , acting , or historical accuracy of any sort . Avoid at all costs unless you 're expecting to see it as a comedy . Compared to Kubrik 's incredible direction for ' Spartacus ' a few years later , the gladiatorial scenes in this film are second rate . Even the low budget film ' Barabas ' with Anthony Quinn had better direction than this worthless film . The screenplay is contrived , the script is worthless , and the acting utterly shallow from everyone on this film : at least ' The Robe ' had Richard Burton . Victor Mature continues to act as if he just came out of a cocktail lounge after a few martinis too many . Jay Robinson continues his idiotic and ridiculous performance of Caligula as if the character were a retarded bufoon instead of the diabolical genius of cruelty and perversion ( See Hurt 's performance in the BBC 's ' I , Claudius ' to see how a good actor handles this character . ) In short , reading the New Testament or going to a church sermon is far more entertaining and historically faithful than watching this garbage film . Just the fact that Victor ' Manure ' is in this film says it all . Ignore this pathetic film and watch ' Spartacus ' , ' Barabas ' , or even the fantasized ' Gladiator ' for some good Gladiatorial films . As for Biblical films , ' Ben Hur ' , ' The Ten Commandments ' or ' Quo Vadis ' are films that are worth watching much more than this putrid Hollywood junk .",317,0,0.00037735849056606466,0.00037735849056606466,0.03927658208737475,0.00037735849056606466,0.00037735849056606466,0.00037735849056606466,0.00037735849056606466,0.00037735849056606466,0.00037735849056606466,0.00037735849056606466,0.00037735849056606466,0.00037735849056606466,0.00037735849056606466,0.00037735849056606466,0.00037735849056606466,0.00037735849056606466,0.00037735849056606466,0.00037735849056606466,0.00037735849056606466,0.00037735849056606466,0.2850582745530979,0.00037735849056606466,0.00037735849056606466,0.00037735849056606466,0.00037735849056606466,0.00037735849056606466,0.022202815373192762,0.00037735849056606466,0.00037735849056606466,0.00037735849056606466,0.00037735849056606466,0.00037735849056606466,0.10752957594951026,0.00037735849056606466,0.00037735849056606466,0.00037735849056606466,0.00037735849056606466,0.00037735849056606466,0.00037735849056606466,0.00037735849056606466,0.024215444706307463,0.00037735849056606466,0.00037735849056606466,0.5051135337456099,0.00037735849056606466,0.00037735849056606466,0.00037735849056606466,0.00037735849056606466,0.00037735849056606466,0.00037735849056606466,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

56795,4,"desperation Controversy courted the release of this film and people went to see it for the actual depictions of sex between the actors , thinking somehow it would be pornographic or titillating . But this film showed two desperate , middle - aged strangers ( with all their flaws abundantly clear ) meeting once a week for no - strings - attached encounters . The fact that the audience sees graphic moments adds only to the "" desperate "" , tawdry , pathetic feel of their relationship . Naturally , one of the two of them becomes too curious and wants to know more about the other partner , one of the greatest pitfalls in the dangerous pursuit of anonymous encounters : sooner or later , anonymity is not good enough anymore .",133,0,0.30635664669076057,0.0010526315789474632,0.0010526315789474632,0.1103875042093153,0.0010526315789474632,0.0010526315789474632,0.0010526315789474632,0.0010526315789474632,0.0010526315789474632,0.0010526315789474632,0.0010526315789474632,0.0010526315789474632,0.0010526315789474632,0.0010526315789474632,0.0010526315789474632,0.0010526315789474632,0.0010526315789474632,0.0010526315789474632,0.0010526315789474632,0.0010526315789474632,0.0010526315789474632,0.0010526315789474632,0.0010526315789474632,0.0010526315789474632,0.0010526315789474632,0.0010526315789474632,0.05527991473063908,0.0010526315789474632,0.0010526315789474632,0.0010526315789474632,0.0010526315789474632,0.0010526315789474632,0.0010526315789474632,0.0010526315789474632,0.0010526315789474632,0.053812512976481056,0.0010526315789474632,0.0010526315789474632,0.0010526315789474632,0.0010526315789474632,0.0010526315789474632,0.0010526315789474632,0.0010526315789474632,0.4267950003401683,0.0010526315789474632,0.0010526315789474632,0.0010526315789474632,0.0010526315789474632,0.0010526315789474632,0.0010526315789474632,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1

Let the audience in on the torment and conflict of Raskolnikov ( the main character ) and interplay of the characters that is so powerful in the book . What I saw was an acceptable theatrical production on film . I 've written much more but it 's unfortunately been truncated .

Those who think differently really ought to either : ( a ) focus a little more ; ( b ) examine their true motives ; or ( c ) get a life",86,0,0.0010526315789474384,0.15465987914692234,0.0010526315789474384,0.0010526315789474384,0.0010526315789474384,0.0010526315789474384,0.0010526315789474384,0.1551301279494864,0.0010526315789474384,0.0010526315789474384,0.0010526315789474384,0.0010526315789474384,0.0010526315789474384,0.0010526315789474384,0.0010526315789474384,0.0010526315789474384,0.0010526315789474384,0.0010526315789474384,0.0010526315789474384,0.0010526315789474384,0.0010526315789474384,0.49002897017095104,0.0010526315789474384,0.0010526315789474384,0.0010526315789474384,0.0010526315789474384,0.0010526315789474384,0.0010526315789474384,0.0010526315789474384,0.0010526315789474384,0.0010526315789474384,0.0010526315789474384,0.0010526315789474384,0.0010526315789474384,0.0010526315789474384,0.0010526315789474384,0.0010526315789474384,0.0010526315789474384,0.0010526315789474384,0.0010526315789474384,0.0010526315789474384,0.0010526315789474384,0.0010526315789474384,0.0010526315789474384,0.1517599701010581,0.0010526315789474384,0.0010526315789474384,0.0010526315789474384,0.0010526315789474384,0.0010526315789474384,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1

56880,4,"A Christmas Memory I 'd rather forget . First off I do not dislike Adam Sandler , I rather enjoy some of his raunchy antics on film , not so much because I like raunchy antics , but because of the underlying message . Adam Sandler really does have a good heart and his films always show this . You can scoff at his bathroom jokes and spitting , farting etc , but he does that to satisfy his fans who paid money to see him , he is loyal to his fans and to his friends . Ever notice how he always gives jobs to Rob Schneider and Dana Carvey ? No one else does , that 's a good friend , also his good old fashioned small town morals always win out of the rich , evil fat cats who try to squeeze him in his films . He never sinks to there level either , perhaps that is why ECN was such a creepy , deeply disturbing film , I can not , in recent memory recall a more unpleasant time at the movies , what was he thinking ? Early on in the film his character , a drunken loser , belches very loudly in a Chinese restaurant "" Ok I go take shower now "" says Chinese waiter . I wanted to take a shower too , very soon after that scene . For starters Mr. Sandler seems to think he is a voice over man , he is not . His idea of a character voice is to squeak his lines out in a nearly impossible to understand whiny nasal twang that is not unlike running a nail down a chalkboard . One can barely understand he is trying to do a character , and he barely is . Also he is the voice of at least four of his characters , he is equally bad in each . Perhaps the most confusing and depressing is the old white heard man who lives with his sister in a little old house , he wants desperately to win a patch saying he is the town good guy or something , he coaches the kids basketball team , he has been for years , and apparently does not work except to do crappy jobs for no pay so people can ignore and not appreciate him , he is simply there to be lovable , and put upon , he is slightly less subtle then a pie in the face ( as is the so - called humor here ) . The script calls for Sandlers character to be a total jerk for no other reason other then to be redeemed at the end , there is no real motivation for his bazaar , cruel and badly aimed antics other then the screenplay calls for them . He starts off the film by driving a snowmobile drunk and smashing two ice sculptures , a menorah and a Christmas thing , I forget what it was . He is a repeat offender so his sentence will be a harsh one , but along comes old squeaky voice to offer the judge a chance to give him a reduced sentence , he lets him coach basketball with him in lue of time in the clink , I can just see the road runner and bugs bunny rolling there eyes and shaking there heads , surly , even in a cartoon there is some sort of rule book . Not here . Of course the judge remands him to the custody of squeaky and off they go . The film then goes on to showcase some of the most outrageous , mindnumbing scenes of animated mayhem this side of a Japanese manga involving tentacles and girls in school uniforms . He goes to the basketball game and insults the children , ridiculing one boy for being fat , the coach is knocked unconscious and puts his hand in his pants "" nice kitty kitty "" he squeaks , what the ? ? ? ? then an angry father gets on Sandlers bad side ( his only side ) and is force fed a jock strap "" I hope you like them extra sweaty "" Ho Ho Ho . For the next part of the film which seems like eight days , crazy or otherwise , his house is burned , he pushes his benefactor down a hill , in a porta potty which freezes feces on him , he is rescued by deer who lick the poop off him , on smiles with a load of ca ca in his teeth . We are treated to this twice . God bless us , every one . By the time the paint by number ending finally gets there we are also subjected to a number of songs , each worse then the last , fortunately they are forgettable as well as bad "" If I move my bowls without using the spray .... that 's a technical foul "" is one of few lines I remember , thank you God . By reading this one might assume , as I did , that this is irreverent in the good way , poking fun at old Christmas standards , but it is not . It is disgusting , badly written , annoying and very , very cruel . The two dimensional nice old brother and sister are treated horribly , for no good reason with no motivation or payoff , the songs are unlistnable and the dialogue is hard to understand , this is not always a bad thing . Of course we discover why the hero is such a jerk , a childhood trauma involving a car crash on Hanukkah , he hooks up with is old sweetheart and lives happily ever after . The same can not be said for the audience . Why would anyone think this was funny or appropriate , who is the audience ? There are many vulgar sexual references that are not claver or cutting edge they are sad and out of place , the over all feel of the film is one of depressed Sinicism and a morbid sense of doom and hopelessness .

56932,4,"Not for absolute begginers THE BADI ca n't say I dislike this item , but I did not like it either . Even though I 'm still a novice golfer ( score between 95 - 105 ) and been playing for about 18 months , I 've read a lot of golf fundamentals articles and studied like 4 other DVDs ... ( yes I 'm an instruction junky ) and I can say that this instrutor ( Simon Holmes ) misses to point out many important fundamental factors that influence a good swing , and even though I like how the DVD has a well structured lesson category listing , he does not explain deeply enough on many things . The filming production seems to have a good intention for this DVD , but it lacks camera closeups / slowmotions on the ball , clubhead , ball lies and graphical enhancements for better understanding of what he want 's to explain . I mean with today 's technology on DVD production , this seems to be a cheap one . THE GOODHe has very good tips on many subjects that I think they 're transparent for a very beginner . If this is not your first instructional DVD , and just want to gather a new bunch of tips , then buy it . Otherwise a better selection that I can reccomend for a complete golf school DVD , is the Wally Armstrong 's Ultimate Golfing Experience . The set is very cheap because it 's a compilation of old ' 80s and 90'videos from that instructor , and from the 5 DVD 's in the box , you can thrash 2 if you like , but for $ 17 bucks ... HEY ! ! is worth it!I hope this helps and saves you some money",306,0,0.11529364124529344,0.00037735849056607843,0.00037735849056607843,0.00037735849056607843,0.00037735849056607843,0.00037735849056607843,0.00037735849056607843,0.00037735849056607843,0.04843029204257778,0.00037735849056607843,0.00037735849056607843,0.00037735849056607843,0.23444144463415834,0.00037735849056607843,0.00037735849056607843,0.00037735849056607843,0.00037735849056607843,0.2298605401527946,0.0192452830188684,0.00037735849056607843,0.00037735849056607843,0.00037735849056607843,0.00037735849056607843,0.00037735849056607843,0.00037735849056607843,0.0395742270438546,0.00037735849056607843,0.00037735849056607843,0.00037735849056607843,0.00037735849056607843,0.00037735849056607843,0.00037735849056607843,0.08051975225306561,0.00037735849056607843,0.00037735849056607843,0.025193436351266685,0.00037735849056607843,0.00037735849056607843,0.00037735849056607843,0.027262133126361998,0.00037735849056607843,0.00037735849056607843,0.020218627463676298,0.00037735849056607843,0.1452436415360053,0.00037735849056607843,0.00037735849056607843,0.00037735849056607843,0.00037735849056607843,0.00037735849056607843,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

I can defintely see why someone wanted to remake this movie . After watching this movie I turned to my wife and said , "" This movie would have been great if it would have stared someone / anyone with an ounce of talent ! "" The acting is very affected and self - conscious ... understand that 's how Hong Kong mega - stars always act ( its a sort of US 1930 's throwback style ) . I really , really despise US film remakes - but Martin must have seen the same potential so many others saw in the intriguing storyline . I would suggest watching the US version first and coming back to the original afterward so that you do not ruin the surprises - not to mention this movie is avoidable without the new - found intrigue .

56990,4,"The worst Best Picture winner ever ? ? ? First off , let me explain why I purchased the AROUND THE WORLD IN 80 DAYS DVD in the first place , sight unseen . One , I was trying to collect as many notable films of the 1950 's as I could on DVD , to add to my personal library . Two , it was the winner of the 1956 Best Picture Oscar ( how bad could it be , right ? ) . And third , it was on sale at my local wholesaler . So I figured , what the hey , I 'll take a chance . Talk about a COLOSSAL disappointment . I 'm a huge movie buff . I 'm only 32 years old , but I love all sorts of films and genres from different periods and countries . I love old black white and silent films , and I do n't shy away from foreign films either . I 'm also a huge fan of Warner Brothers ' 2-Disc Special Edition DVDs . I try to keep an open mind about all the films I see , but I just ca n't come up with any convincing arguments to either buy or watch this film / DVD.To start , there is NO GOOD REASON why this film should be 3 hours long . It could have very easily been edited down to 2 , if not 90 minutes . There is almost no script to speak of , and what little there is consists of trite exchanges and banter with barely 2 memorable lines of dialogue . There are endless shots of open seas or country , followed by about 30 seconds of dialogue , followed by EVEN MORE endless footage of different locales . There is no real drama or comedy going on to drive the film , and the pacing is absolutely DREADFUL ... I found myself hitting the "" fast - foward "" button on my remote on more than a few occasions , simply because I knew I was n't missing any dialogue and the establishing shots would go on for 1 or 2 minutes STRAIGHT!Secondly , the entire cast is virtually wasted . David Niven is always a delight to watch , but is never given a chance to make Fogg truly shine . He has one demeanor that he holds throughout : stiff and mannered , with little or no variation . Cantinflas , who supposedly was one of the highest paid comedians in the world at the time 80 DAYS was produced , gives us little reason to believe how or why he was such a sensation ( other than doing his own stunt work ) . He 's mildly amusing at best , and his accent is so thick and mumbled that I had to rewind and replay some scenes with the "" subtitle "" button on . As for the "" noted "" cameos ... again , the actors / comedians are given little to do and barely play to their strengths and familiarity . The only cameo actor who stuck out as having any real performance or impact was the great John Carradine ( ca n't miss that voice!).It 's hard to believe it took THREE different writers to come up with such a frustratingly bland , lifeless and unfunny script ( not to mention headscratchingly illogical ... when Cantinflas rescues the Shirley MacLaine Princess character , would n't she fall in love with HIM , her actual rescuer , rather than the cool and distant Fogg , who only ordered the rescue ? Talk about a missed opportunity for some genuine comedy!).Although this film obviously has some fans , I wonder if it 's only because of some overriding nostalgia factor , whether it was seeing it for the first time back in 1956 or on TV as a child . Other than that , I ca n't understand how anyone could seriously recommend this film . Yes , it 's beautifully photographed , and the costumes are great , but THAT 'S IT . I ca n't believe that 80 DAYS won the Best Picture Oscar of 1956 , a year that also gave us GIANT , THE TEN COMMANDMENTS , THE KING AND I , THE SEARCHERS ... hell , even FORBIDDEN PLANET or INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS should have won before this overblown moving postcard . I'm sorry to say that I probably wo n't bother watching this film again and will most likely end up reselling my DVD copy ( if anyone will take it ! ) . Certainly my most disappointing DVD purchase EVER . Do n't say you were n't warned !",798,0,0.07911811694116513,0.00013698630136987816,0.019543856383204192,0.018188525436747285,0.00013698630136987816,0.00013698630136987816,0.014470249532446923,0.00013698630136987816,0.00013698630136987816,0.00013698630136987816,0.011784900127823331,0.00013698630136987816,0.00013698630136987816,0.00013698630136987816,0.00013698630136987816,0.00013698630136987816,0.00013698630136987816,0.08744540187622721,0.020666807898044266,0.00013698630136987816,0.3029324046469932,0.00013698630136987816,0.00013698630136987816,0.034046782189316546,0.00013698630136987816,0.04727329324258408,0.00013698630136987816,0.00013698630136987816,0.00013698630136987816,0.00013698630136987816,0.00013698630136987816,0.00013698630136987816,0.00013698630136987816,0.00013698630136987816,0.00013698630136987816,0.014316852583375892,0.00013698630136987816,0.00013698630136987816,0.00013698630136987816,0.00013698630136987816,0.011055548664560618,0.014283031939513007,0.00810819863913303,0.3119715093509193,0.00013698630136987816,0.00013698630136987816,0.00013698630136987816,0.00013698630136987816,0.00013698630136987816,0.00013698630136987816,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

57047,4,"Nail on the Head I first saw this in the theatre because I like Dennis Quaid and Scarlett Johansson . I had never really seen Topher Grace outside of ' That 70 's Show ' which I never kept up with on a regular basis . I fell in love the movie first time I saw it and bought it soon after it came out on DVD . Mr. Grace plays a 26 year - old executive moving up faster in the world than his experience allows him to comprehend . He 's become such a machine in a competivie world that he 's loses his way in life . I was able to relate to his character very well and assume many my age did too . One of mentor 's has told me repeatedly that the mid - twenties can be one of the roughest times in life . So many things are going at once on so many levels . To me , this movie captured that .

57052,4,"Werner Heisenberg , King of Noir . Leave it to the Coen Brothers to make Werner Heisenberg 's Uncertainty Principle the crux of a film noir , and darned if they do n't make a good case for it in "" The Man Who Was n't There . "" ( Typically , they put their argument in the mouth of a loutish lawyer who ca n't even remember Heisenberg 's name . ) Chain - smoking nebbish barber Ed Crane ( Billy Bob Thornton ) makes the only decisive ( and dishonest ) action of his life , and thus begins a chain of events that ends in the doom of himself and several , mostly not - so - innocent , bystanders . In "" The Man Who Was n't There , "" the phrase "" decisive action "" is an oxymoron ; everything Crane and the other characters do is governed solely by chance . Everything that happens -- from the wrong stranger turning up at the wrong time to a horribly timed punch in the face -- changes everything forever , and always for the worse . Set in 1949 in Santa Rosa , Calif. ( a tip of the hat to Hitchcock and "" Shadow of a Doubt , "" perhaps ? ) "" The Man Who Was n't There "" looks perfect . Like every other Coen film , it 's a marvel of production design , and the genius photographer Roger Deakins nails to a tree the dusty black - and - white look of such classic noirs as "" Double Indemnity "" and "" Out of the Past . "" Thematically , however , "" The Man Who Was n't There "" resembles nothing so much as a much more elegant , much better acted remake of Edgar G. Ulmer 's "" Detour , "" in which the characters drift in a low - rent Sartrean hell , totally the victims of fate . But whereas "" Detour "" is more than the sum of its parts , "" The Man Who Was n't There "" is less . The Coen Brothers may believe in chance , but on the screen they leave nothing to chance , so that everything in "" The Man Who Was n't There "" is TOO perfect . In the end the film has the same overstudied , clinical quality that afflicts every Coen film except "" Fargo . "" ( It must be admitted , though , that only one Coen film--""The Hudsucker Proxy""--is ruined by that quality . ) The acting is as superb as in any Coen film . Thornton -- in a role that is nearly wordless except for the voiceover narration tying the plot together -- burns a hole in the celluloid with his intense , hangdog gravity . There are also glittering supporting performances by Frances McDormand as Thornton 's philandering wife Doris ; James Gandolfini as her paramour and boss ; Jon Polito as a shady businessman ; Michael Badalucco as Thornton 's motormouth brother - in - law ; Scarlett Johansson as the teenager Thornton chastely fancies ; and especially Tony Shalhoub , nearly stealing the picture as Freddy Riedenschneider , defense attorney extraordinaire .",545,1,0.0003333333333333686,0.0003333333333333686,0.041846174894848966,0.0003333333333333686,0.0003333333333333686,0.0003333333333333686,0.0003333333333333686,0.22341029567191348,0.10902960608626715,0.0003333333333333686,0.0003333333333333686,0.0003333333333333686,0.0003333333333333686,0.0003333333333333686,0.0003333333333333686,0.0003333333333333686,0.0003333333333333686,0.0003333333333333686,0.0003333333333333686,0.0003333333333333686,0.0003333333333333686,0.14090829500225524,0.0003333333333333686,0.0003333333333333686,0.0003333333333333686,0.024320714664494616,0.0003333333333333686,0.0003333333333333686,0.0003333333333333686,0.0003333333333333686,0.0003333333333333686,0.0003333333333333686,0.0003333333333333686,0.0003333333333333686,0.0003333333333333686,0.04251436345562395,0.0003333333333333686,0.0003333333333333686,0.0003333333333333686,0.0003333333333333686,0.0003333333333333686,0.0003333333333333686,0.0003333333333333686,0.364287174295945,0.03968337592865013,0.0003333333333333686,0.0003333333333333686,0.0003333333333333686,0.0003333333333333686,0.0003333333333333686,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0
57058,4,"Inspiring and well - made Highly enjoyable tale of the life of Marty Maher , the Irish immigrant who rose from humble waiter to become West Point 's beloved athletic trainer and football coach for more than 50 years . Despite personal tragedies , and through two World Wars , Maher inspired generations of young men who came through the distinguished Army officers ' academy , including future legends like Omar Bradley and Dwight D. Eisenhower . Tyrone Power is excellent and compelling as he portrays Maher from young idealist to elderly sage , Irish accent intact all the way . The scenery and West Point pageantry is fun to watch ( although some of it looks like it was filmed inside a studio -- but much else looks like it may have been filmed at the Military Academy ) . Interestingly , there 's not really all that much football in this film -- there 's a little , but it 's mainly the story of Maher and his family , and the young men he came to love like his own sons . With the flame - haired Maureen O'Hara as Maher 's Irish wife Mary , giving a radiant performance . Sentimental in that ' 50s way , of course , but the legendary director John Ford ( working with a cast made up of many of his favorites ) always puts a bite behind the sweetness",240,1,0.0004545454545454891,0.0004545454545454891,0.0004545454545454891,0.0004545454545454891,0.0004545454545454891,0.0004545454545454891,0.0004545454545454891,0.30355692052569566,0.0004545454545454891,0.0004545454545454891,0.0004545454545454891,0.023181818181817974,0.0004545454545454891,0.0004545454545454891,0.0004545454545454891,0.0004545454545454891,0.0004545454545454891,0.0004545454545454891,0.0004545454545454891,0.0004545454545454891,0.0004545454545454891,0.0004545454545454891,0.0004545454545454891,0.0004545454545454891,0.0004545454545454891,0.0004545454545454891,0.0004545454545454891,0.0004545454545454891,0.0004545454545454891,0.1437510585943843,0.0004545454545454891,0.0004545454545454891,0.0004545454545454891,0.0004545454545454891,0.1295246095528796,0.0004545454545454891,0.0004545454545454891,0.0004545454545454891,0.04433608065073468,0.0004545454545454891,0.11074893351791372,0.023966823186674552,0.0004545454545454891,0.20184284669898883,0.0004545454545454891,0.0004545454545454891,0.0004545454545454891,0.0004545454545454891,0.0004545454545454891,0.0004545454545454891,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
57066,4,"Greatest injustice since Sacco and Vanzetti The question at hand in the film Paradise Lost is not as much did these three teenagers commit this heinous act , but rather was there enough evidence to convict them for the murders . The answer , presented by material in the film , is an unflinching no . There was only speculation and rumor to convict the three . The film 's strengths are that it does n't preach , at least not in an overly wrought narrative , and it contains intimate moments with the accused and their families as well as the families of the victims . I can understand the pain and confusion of the victim 's families . What is hard to understand is the bloodlust and need for revenge and retribution that immediately takes hold of them . The victims ' families are the most terrifying aspect of this film . At one point the mother of the Byrnes child says in a hateful and spiteful tone "" I hate them ... I hate them and the mother 's that bore them . ""Is there anything wrong with being hellishly angry with someone who has butchered your child ? No , quite natural really . But the point of this film is that judgment was passed on these kids long before the trial even started . I imagine the Bible belt is a very scary place to be raised in ... I 'll have to ask Brad Pitt what he thinks about it some time . On the issue of the prosecution . They had next to nothing . A very questionable confession from a terrified kid , Jessie , with a 72 IQ , hearsay from a couple of kids who claim they heard Damien bragging about the murder but have no proof , a knife found behind Damien 's house which does n't match the wounds on the bodies , and the assertion that because Damien read about Wicca , he must be a Satanist . To look at the three kids is also an interesting aspect of the film . Jessie , a very small and slow kid seems a bit lost in the world . His IQ is low but he has no previous records of any type of behavior that would associate him with murder . Jason speaks in short breathless words and seems also to suffer from a low IQ . Damien is the key to everything in this film though . The defense made the key mistake of letting Damien take the stand for two reasons . The first reason is that Damien appears to have ADD and after the first 10 minutes of questioning he sort of fades away and answers in bland yes and no 's . The second reason , and the most important , is that Damien is obviously extremely bright . Normally this would n't seem to be a problem but judging from every single person the filmmakers put on camera , smart people are hard to come by in that area of the world . Damien scared them . All of this adds up to the fact that there was not enough evidence to put these kids away and there were other , more sinister and shocking , suspects that needed to be pursued . The war rages on for the West Memphis Three and it is indeed frightening to think that they did it , and terrifying to think they did n't",589,1,0.19488745300594051,0.0927517936298248,0.00023529411764708496,0.031118473965316775,0.00023529411764708496,0.05374626944191988,0.00023529411764708496,0.00023529411764708496,0.00023529411764708496,0.00023529411764708496,0.00023529411764708496,0.00023529411764708496,0.09464446291731221,0.00023529411764708496,0.00023529411764708496,0.00023529411764708496,0.00023529411764708496,0.00023529411764708496,0.01199590290650278,0.013436212757595272,0.00023529411764708496,0.00023529411764708496,0.00023529411764708496,0.00023529411764708496,0.026911104134573424,0.00023529411764708496,0.00023529411764708496,0.00023529411764708496,0.00023529411764708496,0.00023529411764708496,0.00023529411764708496,0.013926573187522917,0.08628368990265506,0.00023529411764708496,0.00023529411764708496,0.00023529411764708496,0.00023529411764708496,0.00023529411764708496,0.00023529411764708496,0.00023529411764708496,0.05260623143054009,0.05339656204030849,0.00023529411764708496,0.22750935619486246,0.03831532624983038,0.00023529411764708496,0.00023529411764708496,0.00023529411764708496,0.00023529411764708496,0.00023529411764708496,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0
57068,4,"A Very Good ( But Sad ) Movie All of these bad reviews confuse a movie they did n't like with a badly made movie . This is a very well made movie , with perfectly competent performances . The tone is quite serious , and the ending wo n't cheer anyone up . But then there are many people who loved Titanic , which I found utterly depressing . More to the point , though , who cares about the problems of these rich kids ? Not me . The REAL reason to watch this is to see Molly Ringwald at her most beautiful . And if you enjoy this film , check out Less Than Zero , another gloomy but solid ( and underrated ) ' 80s film .

57122,4,"One of a kind . When I sat down to watch a movie called Three Woman with the knowledge that one of the three woman is Shelley Duvall , my first reaction was that I would be better off drinking a nice , tall glass of toilet water . But , that reaction was short lived . It is rare for me to enjoy a movie that I was determined to hate from the first second , but this movie forced me to pull a 180 . The ominous feel of the movie gripped my attention within the first five minutes and never let go . It is a trance like movie . I found that I could n't stop from watching yet , I did nt know why I was watching . Very bizzare , and very mezmerizing .

57125,4,""" ha ha ha , you did n't say the magic word , ha ha ha ... "" I read the book in middle school and watched the movie shortly afterwards . A few of the characters were switched around , but I was so impressed with the adaptation . A thriller that still makes me nervous and jumpy - the kids in the kitchen scene and when Mr. Arnold 's arm drops on Ellie 's shoulder as she 's trying to turn the generator back on , for example . There have been countless lines I 've memorized and quoted at appropriate and innapropriate times , due to my obsession . And after watching it more than 25 times , I 've come to appreciate it more . Great cast - Sam Neil is my favorite . Richard Attenborough is a little too cute and nice , but I liked his white clothing , the hat , and the amber cane . Wayne Knight was incredible as Nedry , the slob . He 's as likeable as ever , though somewhat the villain . I always hate it when he dies . Jeff Goldblum fit the description of Ian Malcom from Crichton 's novel well . Crichton sparked my interest in Chaos Theory , sometimes called The Butterfly Effect . I am a firm believer in it . And of course , in the novel and film , Malcolm was right . "" Life finds a way ... "" ( In Chaos Theory , the system is very sensitive to small changes in external conditions , and "" random "" --unpredictable-- events result from the "" normal "" equation / setup , because there is never a fixed set of outcomes ; the system is unpredictable because of its complexity . Hammond thought his system was without error , that he was in complete control . He believed that the dinosaurs would fail to reproduce because all were engineered to be female , but he was wrong - the dinosaurs evolved because of the replacement amphibian DNA that was used to fill in the gaps in the dinosaur DNA . This DNA gave the dinosaurs the ability to change sex in order to reproduce , "" survive , "" in a single - sex environment . And it turned out that Hammond was wrong about many other equations - things are not as black and white as he thought , and it is problematic to predict long - term behavior of his animals.)Love the scene where the lawyer is eaten while sitting on the toilet . We watched the Mr. DNA segment in a high school biology class . I 've always thought it explained the process very well for something that is complicated ( though I found Mr. Hammond 's live speaking lines to be unrealistic ... was he really planning to be there for each tour?).The kids were kind of annoying . I did n't notice this until I was a little older , but Lex ( "" I prefer to be called a hacker "" ) uses Silicon Graphics ' 3D file system navigator to turn power back on in the park . Their logo is on the monitor . If only UNIX were as popular as Windows is now ... Anyway , the soundtrack was classic - it was the first CD I bought , back in the mid-90s .

57127,4,"Scared me away from the bathtub when I was 15 ! THis was the first scary movie I ever saw in the cinema , and it made a strong impression on me . The bathtub scenes were so eerie that I only took showers for a few years after I saw this movie at 15 - that is how much it scared me . I have since watched it as an adult and was able to keep it in healthier perspective , although I do have to say it is pretty scary and well done . Watching it many years later , I was surprised that it lacked a lot of the 70 's cheese that you see in many films from that era . The carpet and some of the clothes were funny , but it did n't detract from the film .

57162,4,"Fred Astaire , Rita Hayworth , Jerome Kern , Johnny Mercer ... And "" I 'm Old Fashioned "" In some of Fred Astaire 's movies there 's only one excellent reason to watch , and that 's to watch Fred Astaire . In You Were Never Lovelier there are three other excellent reasons . Rita Hayworth . Jerome Kern . Johnny Mercer . The four of them have concocted a romantic and funny South American fable that features some great dancing by both Astaire and Hayworth and some memorable songs by Kern and Mercer . Eduardo Acuna ( Adolphe Menjou ) , a wealthy Buenos Aires businessman , has four beautiful daughters , and in the Acuna family they must marry in age order . The eldest fulfills her responsibilities and the two youngest have beaus they 're now anxious to share vows with . But the second eldest , Maria ( Rita Hayworth ) is in no hurry . She wants romance and charm and the men she meets are just panting boys . Then she sees Robert Davis ( Fred Astaire ) , a very charming , down - on - his - luck dancer , singing Dearly Beloved at her elder sister 's wedding . He tries to chat her up ; she stares him down . Then the plot intervenes . Before long she knows what she wants . Robert knows what he wants . Eduardo Acuna knows what he does n't want ... a down - on - his - luck dancer in the family . From then on it 's songs , dances , romance and misunderstandings , which moves into songs , dances and romance . The plot feels sluggish at times and there 's way too much Xavier Cugat and his orchestra , but Astaire and Hayworth are at their peak , Kern has written some memorable melodies and few could top Mercer at lyric writing , none in Hollywood . Hayworth not only was a gorgeous creature , she was a gifted dancer ; many think she was the best Astaire worked with . Technically , she not only handled the steps Astaire created , she did so without a hint of effort . After you 've watched the dances a couple of times , go back and watch again , but this time concentrate on her face and her hand and arm action . She gives every indication of being utterly relaxed and enjoying herself , even in the fast tap routines . She seems naturally to find the most graceful attitude for an extended arm , a turn of her head , a raised hand . She may not be quite as good as Astaire , but she 's good enough . Among the stand - out routines are:--The Audition Dance . Robert shows up at Acuna 's office and demands a chance to show his stuff as a dancer . From there Astaire takes off on a fast tap routine that takes him all over the floor , onto Acuna 's desk , the sofa and chairs . He works into the dance a cane , a rug , the drapes and Acuna 's head . --I'm Old Fashioned . This is probably the best romantic wooing dance Astaire did . It 's all fluid motion and spontaneous recognition , danced on the elegant , polished outdoor landing of Acuna 's mansion . Rita Hayworth is a vision , and matches him step for step . We move from Maria declaring with humor and assurance that Robert 's the man for her , to Robert 's protestation that he 's just a guy from Omaha , Nebraska , to the dance that brings them closer and closer together until we know through the dance that a love match has just happened . The funny exit through the doors and back into the living - room , bumping into each other , each giving way , bumping again and then going in together arm in arm hits just the right note . The dance works so well in part because Kern and Mercer came up with a classic : I'm old fashioned , I love the moonlight , I love the old fashioned things . The sound of rainUpon a window pane , The starry song that April sings . This year 's fanciesAre passing fanciesBut sighing sighs , holding hands , These my heart understands . I'm old fashionedBut I do n't mind it . That 's how I want to be , As long as you agree , To stay old fashioned with me.--The Shorty George . This fast tap routine starts out with Maria visiting Robert at a rehearsal . He sings The Shorty George and she takes a couple of lines . He looks surprised that she knows the song . He starts to dance and invites her to join him . Hayworth stays right with Astaire and looks like she 's having the time of her life.--You Were Never Lovelier . Robert declares his feelings for Maria , but more misunderstandings occur . Finally , everything is resolved . Robert shakes off some knight 's armor he was wearing ( there is sort of a reason ) and appears below Maria 's bedroom window in black tie . She rushes down ... and off they go dancing while all the members of the Acuna family look on approvingly . And the Johnny Mercer lyrics and Jerome Kern music brings us to the happy end : You were never lovelier , you were never so fair ; Dreams were never lovelier , Pardon me if I stare . Down the sky the moonbeams fly to light your face;I can only say they chose the proper place . You were never lovelier , and to coin a new phrase , I was never luckierIn my palmiest days . Make a note , and you can quote me , honor bright , You were never lovelier than you are tonight",1014,1,0.00016129032258066186,0.06656329102101786,0.00016129032258066186,0.00016129032258066186,0.00016129032258066186,0.00016129032258066186,0.00016129032258066186,0.0764715165177051,0.00016129032258066186,0.00016129032258066186,0.00016129032258066186,0.00016129032258066186,0.00016129032258066186,0.00016129032258066186,0.00016129032258066186,0.00016129032258066186,0.046353131555295385,0.00016129032258066186,0.00016129032258066186,0.00016129032258066186,0.31090199656204837,0.00016129032258066186,0.00016129032258066186,0.07719127768046943,0.02067142554937686,0.031265084673221304,0.022300369089335415,0.00016129032258066186,0.018654635793996188,0.028170102475711965,0.00016129032258066186,0.00903663383026075,0.055446501788182945,0.00016129032258066186,0.00016129032258066186,0.012777691804090127,0.00016129032258066186,0.00016129032258066186,0.02620503628847527,0.00016129032258066186,0.00016129032258066186,0.00016129032258066186,0.027652534368523225,0.00016129032258066186,0.05126809372189072,0.11374809663523738,0.00016129032258066186,0.00016129032258066186,0.00016129032258066186,0.00016129032258066186,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0

Congregating in a filthy , deplorable shooting gallery the gang is shown in graphic manner getting high .

Remembering the constipation from a previous attempt he goes out to score suppositories . In a humorous scene , cramps force him to use the filthiest toilet in Scotland into which he drops his precious suppositories . He then dives into the disgusting toilet to retrieve them . McGregor eventually does clean up complete with cold turkey induced horrific hallucinations , escaping to London and working as a realtor . His buddies follow him there and reel him back into the life . McGregor and Carlyle and two other buddies eventually have their dreams come true, ........ the big drug deal .

57218,4,"a must - see This documentary gives a brief introduction to Al - Jazeera , which , if you did n't know already , is the main arab language newschannel . It is a source which has won a great deal of respect in the arab world for it 's willingness to go where other , stated - owned and controlled arab networks wo n't tread . In this sense it is more than a mere arab CNN in that it stands out more in the general landscape of arab media . The filmmakers here interview Al - Jazeera personel , as well as some american journalists , and the american official which liases with Al - Jazeera for Centcom , the american Central Command in the present Irak war ( which happens to be 30 miles from Al Jazeera headquarters ) . It covers the timeline from just before the war , to just after Bush anounced main millitary operations to be over . By striving to be neutral , the documentary allows you to see how Al - Jazeera see themselves and how they conceive their mission in the world . They are very disappointed in the United States , but adhere strongly to its values . Also interesting is how being "" on the arab side "" gives them a very different perspective from western media in spite of the fact that they clearly espouse its values , like when they are angered by Pentagon protests at their having showed images of US prisoners , when western media routinely show Iraki POWs . An unexpected insight the documentary affords you is that it lets you see just how incompetent millitary media management can be . The american liaison does n't speak a word of arabic in spite of being assigned by his goverment to the most important arab news source , and as if that were n't enough , he is barely articulate in english and clearly does n't know anything about the local context and history . Another instance of bungled media operations is when centcom tells journalists about the deck of cards with the most wanted iraki officials , but does n't have the foresight to have some to give to journalists , irritating the very people they are trying to win over . All in all it 's a compelling watch which gives you a good look into the producers of news in the west and arab worlds . It gets four stars rather than five because of it 's sometimes amateurish handling of flow , which makes it at times a bit unfocused",440,1,0.21193946800371244,0.0003846153846154184,0.0003846153846154184,0.0003846153846154184,0.038797054844452825,0.0003846153846154184,0.0003846153846154184,0.15356591124277605,0.0003846153846154184,0.0003846153846154184,0.0003846153846154184,0.0003846153846154184,0.1360597877613126,0.0003846153846154184,0.0003846153846154184,0.0003846153846154184,0.0003846153846154184,0.0003846153846154184,0.019605405833445794,0.0003846153846154184,0.0003846153846154184,0.11860542683139512,0.0003846153846154184,0.0003846153846154184,0.0003846153846154184,0.0003846153846154184,0.0003846153846154184,0.0003846153846154184,0.0003846153846154184,0.0003846153846154184,0.0003846153846154184,0.17540308833507098,0.0003846153846154184,0.0003846153846154184,0.0003846153846154184,0.0003846153846154184,0.0003846153846154184,0.0410496041177817,0.08920502226082025,0.0003846153846154184,0.0003846153846154184,0.0003846153846154184,0.0003846153846154184,0.0003846153846154184,0.0003846153846154184,0.0003846153846154184,0.0003846153846154184,0.0003846153846154184,0.0003846153846154184,0.0003846153846154184,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Since I 've already reviewed and bought both of these as separate items , I 'm not gon na repeat anything about each show ( see individual reviews for that ) . I will just rehash what I have all along . Despite its missing pieces from the book , the Original is still 5 star material . The "" in betweener "" is only worth it 's value because it is a disc copy ( as opposed to a tape copy ) . My advice , buy the Original separately , and read the book to get the "" real missing years "" . If you are building a library of "" ALL Richard Chamberlain "" , then buy both or this combo .

Oh , sure , I rooted for Charlie and his uncle , the poorest of the poor , simply trying to make ends meet . And who did n't despise Veruca Salt , the bratty English tart -- with a pushover for a father -- who acted like the world was her private oyster?But having recently purchased and viewed this movie on DVD with my wife and little daughter , I was dazzled at how magical the Chocolate Factory still is , even in our age of CG film wizardry . And without having seen the new version , I ca n't help but think that even the versatile Johnny Depp is not up to the task of leaping Gene Wilder 's timeless portrayal of the candy tycoon , Willy Wonka . More impressive was the fact that this movie clearly dates from a time in hollywood when filmmakers were not above delivering straightforward , old - fashioned morality tales with universal appeal . Several deadly sins are on display throughout this film , including gluttony , vanity , greed , and avarice ; and the end results of these unchecked urges are plain to young and old alike . The lessons for children and parents are hilariously and sometimes embarrassingly illustrated , and I have to wonder if this has been preserved in the new film , or scuttled for some altogether more nebulous message more in tune with the 21st century postmodernism that Hollywood has embraced?I'll have to check it out . Meanwhile , see the classic , and be charmed all over again",338,1,0.00033898305084749056,0.00033898305084749056,0.016516352987928154,0.00033898305084749056,0.00033898305084749056,0.00033898305084749056,0.00033898305084749056,0.00033898305084749056,0.02096380676332388,0.00033898305084749056,0.00033898305084749056,0.00033898305084749056,0.18739479617103352,0.00033898305084749056,0.00033898305084749056,0.00033898305084749056,0.00033898305084749056,0.03208260448257072,0.00033898305084749056,0.00033898305084749056,0.24568859873547527,0.00033898305084749056,0.00033898305084749056,0.03585998183911115,0.00033898305084749056,0.00033898305084749056,0.00033898305084749056,0.00033898305084749056,0.00033898305084749056,0.00033898305084749056,0.00033898305084749056,0.00033898305084749056,0.00033898305084749056,0.00033898305084749056,0.08217816148220419,0.00033898305084749056,0.00033898305084749056,0.017322854805713758,0.00033898305084749056,0.00033898305084749056,0.00033898305084749056,0.05463084655587008,0.02110388166159099,0.27303777553212605,0.00033898305084749056,0.00033898305084749056,0.00033898305084749056,0.00033898305084749056,0.00033898305084749056,0.00033898305084749056,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

If you do , within the first 10 minutes , you will pause it , and have to run out for chinese food instantly and not the quick take out junk either , but the honest to god traditional chinese cuisine that the father makes . I adore this movie , It is a heartwarming , hilarious story about a Widower Retired Master Chef and his Three very different daughters . Ang Lee gives us insight into this family from the perspective of how love and life and humanity can be compared to eating and drinking .

57264,4,"Realistic , Yet Hopeless War Story . Based upon director and writer Oliver Stone 's own experiences in Vietnam , PLATOON was the first major motion picture about that war directed by a veteran from that conflict . The movie revolves around a young American soldier , Pvt . Chris Taylor ( a young Charlie Sheen ) and the platoon he lives and fights with during his tour of duty . The battle sequences are very gritty , graphic , and realistic . Taylor serves under the direct leadership of Sgt . Elias Grodin ( Willem Dafoe ) , but both men are under the command of Staff Sgt . Bob Barnes ( Tom Berenger ) . Grodin and Barnes have two completely different views of leadership and opposing worldviews . Grodin represents everything that is good and noble and worth fighting for in the conflict , while Barnes represents all the evil and ugliness of the war . At its core then , PLATOON is a movie about the internal war for one soldier 's soul between good and evil . Though Stone based the film upon his own experiences , there are scenes that have been embellished and the view Stone presents is only one view of the war -- see the film WE WERE SOLDIERS for the opposite view as presented by Stone in PLATOON.Despite the negative outlook upon life , the military , and the Vietnam War , PLATOON is probably Oliver Stone 's best movie to date . Stone 's direction of the film is brilliant from the two - week boot camp the actors endured before principal filming , to the fine details such as the color of the wrapping paper on the cigarettes , to filming in sequence , to recognizing the talent of Johnny Depp , Stone illustrated in PLATOON was that he was a great director and one to be reckoned with . The film contains fine performances : Tom Berenger , Willem Dafoe , Charlie Sheen , Forest Whitaker , Francesco Quinn , John C. McGinley , and Johnny Depp all give powerful portrayals that ground the movie in humanity , despite the deep metaphysical connotations . PLATOON won the 1986 Oscar for Best Picture , Stone won the Best Director Oscar , and also received a nomination for Best Original Screenplay . I was surprised and found that I enjoyed PLATOON , though there were several parts of the film that I found myself aghast . I 've never been in battle myself , but I do know that war is hell . Nevertheless , I can not bring myself to agree with the film 's negative worldview and ultimately the loss of one 's soul to evil . Despite this , there are many positive things within the movie . This is a movie that any film buff should see and people who enjoy war movies might enjoy it as well ( though they might prefer something more hopeful such as SAVING PRIVATER RYAN or WE WERE SOLDIERS )",511,1,0.0002564102564102784,0.0002564102564102784,0.0002564102564102784,0.018430471348847524,0.0002564102564102784,0.0002564102564102784,0.0002564102564102784,0.12165401204251604,0.014627934500182987,0.0002564102564102784,0.0002564102564102784,0.01346523226563884,0.0002564102564102784,0.0002564102564102784,0.0002564102564102784,0.0002564102564102784,0.0002564102564102784,0.0002564102564102784,0.0002564102564102784,0.0002564102564102784,0.19537504254936253,0.0002564102564102784,0.0002564102564102784,0.0002564102564102784,0.0002564102564102784,0.0002564102564102784,0.0002564102564102784,0.0002564102564102784,0.0002564102564102784,0.0002564102564102784,0.0002564102564102784,0.12845372798040866,0.0002564102564102784,0.0002564102564102784,0.1153571530351085,0.0002564102564102784,0.0002564102564102784,0.0002564102564102784,0.04883799817704317,0.0002564102564102784,0.0002564102564102784,0.0002564102564102784,0.0002564102564102784,0.33328560758807046,0.0002564102564102784,0.0002564102564102784,0.0002564102564102784,0.0002564102564102784,0.0002564102564102784,0.0002564102564102784,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

Or if you want to just lose yourself in a big Kids marathon you can select",154,1,0.0005263157894737292,0.0005263157894737292,0.0005263157894737292,0.0005263157894737292,0.0005263157894737292,0.15288501352332132,0.0005263157894737292,0.0005263157894737292,0.0005263157894737292,0.0005263157894737292,0.0005263157894737292,0.0264623897839276,0.0005263157894737292,0.0005263157894737292,0.0005263157894737292,0.0005263157894737292,0.0005263157894737292,0.24165426469317913,0.0005263157894737292,0.0005263157894737292,0.0005263157894737292,0.0005263157894737292,0.0005263157894737292,0.07881511944970408,0.0005263157894737292,0.02895240921411849,0.0005263157894737292,0.0005263157894737292,0.022953506786742316,0.04058860597305995,0.0005263157894737292,0.0005263157894737292,0.0005263157894737292,0.0005263157894737292,0.0005263157894737292,0.07725107454453445,0.0005263157894737292,0.0005263157894737292,0.0005263157894737292,0.0005263157894737292,0.0005263157894737292,0.0005263157894737292,0.0005263157894737292,0.0005263157894737292,0.27396621944993577,0.03541876500252778,0.0005263157894737292,0.0005263157894737292,0.0005263157894737292,0.0005263157894737292,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0

57300,4,""" I am the bleepin ' king of Dirk ! "" Given that pornography is a multi - jillion - dollar - a - year business , it 's sort of surprising that it has n't received the cinematic treatment more often , but Boogie Nights provides it with the sort of skewed , darkly comic treatment that it almost certainly deserves , and becomes a certifiable classic in the process . Following the story of Eddie Adams , a simple - minded , almost impossibly well - endowed teenager from suburban California who achieves porn stardom as Dirk Diggler before turning 20 , Boogie Nights is both a time - tested star - is - born - and - almost - blows - it - all story and a loving tribute to a time and place that will probably never be replicated and the individuals who made it what it was . Paul Thomas Anderson 's directing is as excessive and stylish as you 'd expect from a movie centered on the porno industry , with Anderson pulling out every trick in the book -- long tracking shots , underwater closeups , montages , movie - within - a - movie views , and some moments that approach stream - of - consciousness ( Dirk 's vision of his professional name literally exploding off a neon sign being a prominent example ) . Naturally , Anderson also loads the movie up with period details , right down to the Farah Fawcett poster in teenage Dirk 's room , the platform shoes , and the obligatory disco sequences . Its visual flair aside , though , Boogie Nights is also the sort of insanely quotable , watch - it - until - you've - memorized - it movie that seemed to come out in droves in the nineties ( Trainspotting , Fargo , Goodfellas , Swingers , True Romance , etc . etc . etc . ) but has been in disturbingly short supply this decade . This movie simply seems to have everything you can think of going for it , especially its murderer 's row of a cast -- Burt Reynolds ( Jack Horner ) , Don Cheadle ( Buck Swope ) , John C. Reilly ( Reed Rothchild ) , Julianne Moore ( Amber Waves ) , William H. Macy ( Little Bill ) , Luis Guzman ( Maurice Rodriguez ) , Tom Jane ( Todd Parker ) , Philip Baker Hall ( Floyd Gondolli ) , Philip Seymour Hoffman ( Scotty Jay ) , and Alfred Molina ( Rahad Jackson ) all figure prominently -- and even Wahlberg ( Dirk himself ) and Heather Graham ( Rollergirl ) have roles that are perfectly suited to their relative limitations as actors . That said , what really gives the movie its resonance is the obvious sympathy with which it treats its characters , who are generally easy to laugh at but equally easy to like . The main characters almost entirely have hopes , aspirations , and attachments beyond the rather closed world of their profession -- Jack 's desire to be a serious filmmaker ; Dirk 's ridiculous pseudo - Karate and Reed 's equally ridiculous poetry ; Buck 's goal of opening his own stereo store ; Amber 's attempts to get back in touch with her son , which she blatantly compensates for by mothering her co - stars -- helping us see them as fleshed - out characters , not just plot devices in the story . Since there is n't really a plot to speak of , the movie is told as a series of episodes , Goodfellas - style , with several extended pieces -- the pool party at Jack 's House where Eddie / Dirk gets introduced to the whole crew ; the New Year 's Eve party celebrating the start of the ' 80 's ; the fake drug deal gone bad at a Rahad 's house -- serving to turn the narrative in new directions . This last set piece -- when Dirk , Reed , and Todd head over to Rahad 's house to sell him some baking soda disguised as cocaine and it quickly degenerates into a laughably misguided robbery attempt -- deserves special mention , as it 's easily one of the most fascinating single scenes in recent film memory . It starts off almost surreal , with a skinny Chinese guy walking around randomly lighting firecrackers and Rahad ( clad only in underwear , a bathrobe and slippers ) discoursing semi - coherently as he sings along to not - so - classic 80 's songs on a mixtape . From there it just gets progressively darker and tenser , with the lighting , acting , and direction all perfectly serving to ratchet up the feeling of desperation and horror as Todd kicks his ill - conceived robbery plot into motion and things spin way out of control . Molina 's over - the - top performance , more than anything else , makes the scene , as he turns Rahad into a manic ball of drug - fuelled energy and , later , a shotgun - toting avenging angel determined to take his revenge . I would n't say Molina turns in the best performance I 've ever seen in a movie , but it it probably the best performance I 've seen from someone who only got one scene in the whole movie . The ' 80 's are , of course , the hangover from the joys of the previous decade , as the emergence of video downgrades the quality of the product , cocaine suddenly becomes addictive , and Dirk starts to become too big for his britches in more ways than one . Fittingly , as the disco era gives way to tougher times in the eighties , the movie takes a darker turn , becoming grittier , more downcast and a lot more violent , but no less compelling . All the unbridled energy and creativity of the first half is still present , just in a decidedly less sunny form . Even when people are getting beaten up and shot left and right , the movie 's pedal - to - the - metal pacing makes it all but impossible to look away . Well , except maybe for the notorious money shot at the end , but by then I for one did n't care .",1090,1,0.05470197452167499,0.06442886959079414,0.009252933530539655,0.00013333333333335142,0.00013333333333335142,0.00013333333333335142,0.007113655907301724,0.00013333333333335142,0.00013333333333335142,0.00013333333333335142,0.0072662161159709375,0.010417897065320684,0.043393893802769444,0.00013333333333335142,0.01232590813707438,0.00013333333333335142,0.00013333333333335142,0.00013333333333335142,0.006799999999999069,0.04554548636690032,0.38441278750194363,0.00013333333333335142,0.00013333333333335142,0.019164509692929776,0.00013333333333335142,0.00013333333333335142,0.05522372912942423,0.00013333333333335142,0.00013333333333335142,0.00013333333333335142,0.00013333333333335142,0.00013333333333335142,0.00013333333333335142,0.00013333333333335142,0.00013333333333335142,0.00013333333333335142,0.01063264901129608,0.00013333333333335142,0.00013333333333335142,0.02541910372095807,0.00013333333333335142,0.007045727162864438,0.00013333333333335142,0.2039029569055136,0.00013333333333335142,0.028685035170057507,0.00013333333333335142,0.00013333333333335142,0.00013333333333335142,0.00013333333333335142,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0

57309,4,"Ups and Downs -- War and Remembrance miniseries from 1988 I did not see this series when it originally aired in the late 80 's . I had seen Winds of War , however , and -- at that time , I loved it . Now , when I purchased the DVD 's , both series seem somewhat dated and the acting stilted at times to the point of being a distraction . I particularly have trouble with accepting Robert Mitchum as a virile , intelligent , sombre , alert and perceptive , about 50-something Pug Henry . I wish some filmmaker ( Curtis would be great ! ) would do a REMAKE of this entire project -- making it into a 4 hour feature movie -- tightening up the script entirely ( apologies to Mr. Wouk who wrote the teleplay ) -- mostly keep in the historical scenes -- but more realistic battle scenes especially those at sea-- and do away with some of the long , soap opera dialogue scenes . Keep the Holocaust part intact --these were the MOST powerful Holocaust scenes I 've EVER seen and I 've seen most of them ; but have someone like Kevin Costner be Pug Henry ( or Harrison Ford ) . And find a truly young , very vibrant Natalie ( an actress who has a commanding yet somehow innocent presence ) , and a gorgeous , rather naive rebel leading man to play Byron ( Briney ) .

57314,4,""" Death to the fascist insect that preys on the life of the people ! "" The documentary , "" Guerrilla -- The Taking of Patty Hearst "" is a good , solid look at the bizarre story behind the Symbionese Liberation Army ( the SLA)--how the SLA formed , what actions / crimes they committed , and how the group was finally apprehended . The film examines the political climate in 1970s America , and how disillusionment with government led to the formation of the revolutionary SLA . Political rhetoric aside , the SLA careened through California on a crime spree that involved the murder of two people and even descended into the pettiness of shoplifting a pair of socks . But more than just an investigation into the events surrounding the SLA , filmmaker Michael Stone raises some interesting philosophical questions about crime and punishment . Using interviews with surviving SLA members Russ Little and Michael Bortin -- as well as archival news footage of the times , the documentary examines how the SLA -- led by escaped criminal DeFreeze Cinque -- zoomed into the headlines after the 1974 kidnapping of Patty Hearst , daughter of William Randolph Hearst . Several members of the SLA were Berkeley students -- including Emily Harris -- who worked in the UC Berkeley 's registrar 's office . With Patty Hearst as a hostage , the SLA began making demands for food distribution for poor communities , but lest one imagines that the SLA members were driven by egalitarian motives , it must be remembered that the SLA financed their lifestyle by robbing banks . During the robbing of a bank in Carmichael , customer Myna Opsahl was shot in the stomach by a shotgun blast and left there to die . No doubt the most shocking aspect in the history of the SLA was Patty Hearst 's transformation from kidnap victim to the gun - toting ' Tania ' ( renamed for an old girlfriend of Che Guevara ) who participated in several bank robberies . The documentary includes televised pleas from Hearst 's parents for Patty 's safety , audiotapes from Patty announcing that she 's joined the group , as well as clips of Patty 's former fiance , Stephen Weed . Tim Findley -- a SF Chronicle reporter who covered this bizarre case -- also appears adding his insightful comments . The kidnapping of Patty Hearst and her subsequent brainwashing / conversion to the SLA remains disturbing , and certainly raises many philosophical questions . Was she just an innocent kidnapping victim , or was she young and impressionable enough to be influenced by the SLA 's theories on class war ? Did the fact that the Hearst family is rich and powerful have any bearing on their daughter 's Presidential pardon ? Well watch the documentary and decide for yourself . There 's so much to be learned from watching a documentary that explores in depth an old news item that still remains locked in the archives of one 's memory . DVD extras include comments by the director Michael Stone , the audiotapes by Patty Hearst , footage of the Hibernia bank robbery , and segments of court hearings between SLA members and the son of murder victim Myna Opsahl . These speeches from the former SLA members -- as they try to explain and justify the murder of Opsahl -- serve as a reminder of the irrevocable damage caused by taking a life -- displacedhuma",590,1,0.13783159101754572,0.0004444444444444769,0.030877825351860604,0.0004444444444444769,0.0004444444444444769,0.0004444444444444769,0.0004444444444444769,0.1654625650546608,0.0004444444444444769,0.0004444444444444769,0.0004444444444444769,0.0004444444444444769,0.0004444444444444769,0.0004444444444444769,0.022666666666665697,0.0004444444444444769,0.0004444444444444769,0.0004444444444444769,0.02266666666666672,0.0004444444444444769,0.0004444444444444769,0.0004444444444444769,0.0004444444444444769,0.0644416512493158,0.0004444444444444769,0.0004444444444444769,0.0004444444444444769,0.0004444444444444769,0.0004444444444444769,0.025723523183565966,0.0004444444444444769,0.043762308959100105,0.0004444444444444769,0.0004444444444444769,0.0004444444444444769,0.0004444444444444769,0.0004444444444444769,0.0004444444444444769,0.0004444444444444769,0.0004444444444444769,0.0004444444444444769,0.06793708157802224,0.0004444444444444769,0.27355932652192033,0.0004444444444444769,0.08465931915795966,0.043522585703826264,0.0004444444444444769,0.0004444444444444769,0.0004444444444444769,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0

If you are more interested in learning more about broadway , rather than just seeing performances , then I would buy "" Broadway : The American Musical "" ( which can be found on Amazon ) .",216,1,0.20030257204722482,0.00044444444444449906,0.00044444444444449906,0.00044444444444449906,0.00044444444444449906,0.061589064559258486,0.00044444444444449906,0.00044444444444449906,0.00044444444444449906,0.00044444444444449906,0.00044444444444449906,0.00044444444444449906,0.00044444444444449906,0.00044444444444449906,0.00044444444444449906,0.00044444444444449906,0.00044444444444449906,0.1538331896302971,0.00044444444444449906,0.00044444444444449906,0.00044444444444449906,0.10905875842737828,0.00044444444444449906,0.029469253247787448,0.00044444444444449906,0.00044444444444449906,0.00044444444444449906,0.00044444444444449906,0.00044444444444449906,0.00044444444444449906,0.00044444444444449906,0.022666666669990992,0.08208436688424901,0.00044444444444449906,0.00044444444444449906,0.00044444444444449906,0.00044444444444449906,0.00044444444444449906,0.032435264846032465,0.00044444444444449906,0.12584310424692305,0.00044444444444449906,0.00044444444444449906,0.0941830252090733,0.00044444444444449906,0.07120140089844956,0.00044444444444449906,0.00044444444444449906,0.00044444444444449906,0.00044444444444449906,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0
57337,4,"A cynical "" On The Town . "" It is a Gene Kelly vehichle and there are three wartime buddies , but that 's pretty much where the "" On The Town "" similarities end .

57340,4,"Still Funny Maybe you had to be there . Maybe the actual film never quite measures up to what has been preserved in the memory of a certain generation . And with literary roots in journalistic observations of the blandly benign Cameron Crowe , maybe it lacks the nerve to truly explore the teenage sex blues with the farcical abandon of its vulgar cousin Porky's . But even today Fast Times remains funny , with witty set pieces and a host of emerging Hollywood stars flirting , dating and hooking up to the rock soundtrack of the period . As burnout surfer Jeff Spicoli , Sean Penn achieved well - deserved legendary status . Yet special props go to Judge Reinhold as the hang - dog dirty old senior .

57346,4,"redemption Two years later , the Red Sox fan still wakes up on the odd morning late in September thinking it never happened . It was a utopian dream , the comfort of the drugged and sleeping . But it * did * happen . It 's here on film . They could n't have made this all up and - besides - I remember it . Like it was yesterday . The producers of this DVD did n't have much of a World Series series to work with . The Sox swept the Cardinals in four . The real drama was the American League Championship Series . Still , the producers have done a remarkable job of building the context of the Curse of the Bambino , the tragedy snatched from the jaws of triumph in years that are branded into the thighs and brains of Red Sox fans - 1967 , 1975 , 1986 - the new Spring hopes that make one feel a little foolish . The mind games . The despair . The self - loathing . It all ended in 2004 . It 's right here on film . The names now fit comfortably beside those of Yaz and the rest of Fenway 's venerable ghosts : Schilling , Damon ( still beloved in pinstripes ) , Pedro , Millar , Derek Lowe , Trot , Big Papi , Manny Being Manny , ' Skip ' Francona , the undyingly heroic field captain ' Tek ' Varitek , the man paid to steal one base ( Dave Roberts ) . The gutsy trade of Nomar . Then there were the demons of this passion play : All the Yankees , but particularly A - Rod , who played the part of a bizarrely emasculated Lucifer . And all the Yankees , again . And again . Everybody else was just there that season for bit parts and background noise for Big Papi 's walkoff homers and Curt Schillings epochal bloody sock , the crux of Red Sox Nation 's unlikely redemption . A Red Sox fan watching this DVD for the fifth time can still not suppress the goosebumps . Where were we for this game ? And that game ? The true fans among us are slightly embarrassed about the fact that we remember where , a stroke of intellectual capacity that is supposed to be reserved for truly international events . As I write this in mid - October , 2006 , the Sox are at home and Detroit is facing off with Oakland for the American League Championship . It does n't matter . We won . It 's right there on the DVD . Plus , the soundtrack is brilliant . It all ends in glory after all , not ashes .

57353,4,"Tour de force acting ! There have been emblematic films that plainly , justifies its success based on serious denounces that attempt against the environment . But few times , we had had the opportunity to watch with such boldness the ferociousness , constancy and dedication like this one . We should be back to the times if Silkwood or The China syndrome to feel with such powerful intensity the importance about the magnitude of the ethical limits of the industrialization and the preservation of the environmental health ; that degenerated in an unpredictable scandal of majuscule proportions On the other hand of the coin , ( and I must confess I have never been a special fan of Mrs. Roberts ) she displayed by far , the best of her repertoire and gave us a very real portrait that deserved her the Academy Award that year . One more thing : in order to the fairness , I would personally would have stated decreed an equal number of votes with another superb and perhaps never equaled performance : Ellen Burstyn and "" Requiem for a dream "" . And that I keep this statement taking into account that famous double prize between Barbara Streisand and Vanessa Redgrave in 1967 , where the difference in what acting concerns was even major .

57384,4,"FUNNY AND DELIGHTFUL COMEDY "" Office Space "" is a very funny comedy . Many parts of the film were a delight . In the beginning , when everyone is stalled in traffic , I knew the feeling . Working at Initech Corporation as a computer programmer makes for one dull job in the life of Peter Gibbons ( Ron Livingston ) . Besides having a job he hates , he is enclosed in a cubicle as everyone else is . Then there is his boss Lumbergh -- an arrogant jerk . Life for Peter Gibbons is just one boring day after another . That is until he decides to go see a counselor at the suggestion [ and demands ] of his then girlfriend . While undergoing hypnotic suggestion , the psychologist dies of a heart - attack . But Peter is now a changed man . He no longer cares about his job , and says whatever 's on his mind . And his boss Lumbergh gets a healthy dose of this new Peter . When Peter learns of the impending layoff [ courtesy of John C. McGinley and his partner ] at Initech Corporation , he decides to hatch an idea of ripping off the company with a computer virus . His two fellow co - workers and friends are only too happy to go along : afterall , they 're part of the layoff 's . And on top of that , the company men want to make Peter a supervisor . This film is funny on many levels . With Jennifer Anniston as the love interest of Peter , and the character actors that make up the film -- it makes for an enjoyable watch . Jennifer Anniston 's character and her dealings with her boss and his "" FLAIRS "" are also funny . This is a highly recommended comedy . I 'm sure we can all relate to some of the funny scenes that are played out in the film between Peter and his boss Lumbergh .

57386,4,"the white warrior Kickboxer came out a year after the highly popular "" Bloodsport "" and like Bloodsport , Kickboxer is no doubt a "" Van Damme classic "" . There are plenty of fights and lots of good training sequences , however the acting suffers - worse than Bloodsport in that department . As for the plot - revenge - go figure . But we do n't need good acting and plot to enjoy this movie . Hey , it came to the point a good american martial art movie strives off of bad acting and weak plots so you can focus more on the action . Fortunately , Kickboxer delivers it well . The movie begins with a couple of good fights right away . About 1/2 of the movie is training sequences , but many are enjoyable to watch . The final fight is between the villain , Tong Po ( played by Michel Qissi ) and Kurt Sloane ( Van Damme ) . Its a rather lenghty fight , about 10 minutes , which is nice . Above all else , they fight with hands wrapped in rope with broken glass glued on , and yes the result is some blood during the fighting . Kickboxer is the only martial art movie I know of that used this "" ancient Thai style of fighting "" ( with the exception of Kickboxer 2 and a small scene in Ring of Fire ) . I really enjoyed this . I also enjoyed Michel Qissi . He had maybe one line in the movie , but still succeeded in making Tong Po a great villain , who also will return in the sequal . Lastly , we ca n't forget to mention the Van Damme dance - Napoleon Dynamite would be proud . Also keep an eye out for Ong Soon Han ( main villain in both Bloodsport 2 and Dragon : The Bruce Lee Story ) , who has a short fight against Tong Po about 1/2 way through the movie",343,1,0.00032258064516132334,0.085036324142596,0.00032258064516132334,0.00032258064516132334,0.00032258064516132334,0.00032258064516132334,0.00032258064516132334,0.00032258064516132334,0.00032258064516132334,0.00032258064516132334,0.00032258064516132334,0.019093610580521572,0.00032258064516132334,0.00032258064516132334,0.00032258064516132334,0.00032258064516132334,0.00032258064516132334,0.00032258064516132334,0.016448458587682253,0.00032258064516132334,0.532012475006509,0.17801660416717835,0.00032258064516132334,0.01766901296904824,0.00032258064516132334,0.00032258064516132334,0.021245479024232565,0.00032258064516132334,0.00032258064516132334,0.00032258064516132334,0.00032258064516132334,0.017887900857591208,0.00032258064516132334,0.00032258064516132334,0.00032258064516132334,0.01725421334978168,0.00032258064516132334,0.00032258064516132334,0.00032258064516132334,0.00032258064516132334,0.08243269550840614,0.00032258064516132334,0.00032258064516132334,0.00032258064516132334,0.00032258064516132334,0.00032258064516132334,0.00032258064516132334,0.00032258064516132334,0.00032258064516132334,0.00032258064516132334,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
57388,4,"Defines a different kind of movie Maybe you 've heard that "" it 's all been done before . "" Gaiman and McKean prove that wrong with this unique movie . It really is something new . McKean has worked for years in the comic industry , defining a visual style that works at a visceral level . The style has many ways to look , depending on the combination of collaged photos and painterly fantasy . Some times McKean 's work evokes sculpture in concrete or stone , other times it 's a pen - scrawl of some horrible fear trying to waken . Disparate elements come together on his canvas to create a rich visual experience . I never imagined that such painterly fantasy worlds could come to life - well , I was wrong . This movie 's imagery defies easy description . I can only invite you to see it for yourself , and to experience a movie that is truly like no other . The small - screen video makes me regret missingn the big - screen theater experience . The sound track generally works well , too , from the surreal drone of Mrs. Bagwell 's Victrola to the nightmare chant of the Jill - in - the - boxes during Helena 's transformation . I 'm not normally one to notice , but Mirrormask 's music complements its look flawlessly . You did n't come here for the story : light and dark in conflict , lost mystic artifact , plucky youth , untrustworthy side - kick . The acting does n't distinguish itself either , despite some great hissing from the evil queen and good moments from the sphinxes . Stephanie Leonidas does a good job in the Helena role , with a convincing sulky / sultry mix . If you liked the acting in the original Dr. Who series , this will rise to your highest expectations . The story is n't the strength here . You 'll see it and remember it for creating a look that others are sure to copy.//wiredweir",352,1,0.0002777777777778051,0.0002777777777778051,0.0002777777777778051,0.0002777777777778051,0.0002777777777778051,0.0002777777777778051,0.0002777777777778051,0.0002777777777778051,0.07392852527843784,0.0002777777777778051,0.0002777777777778051,0.0002777777777778051,0.08516664606010117,0.0002777777777778051,0.0002777777777778051,0.0002777777777778051,0.0002777777777778051,0.0002777777777778051,0.0002777777777778051,0.0002777777777778051,0.22829669439873068,0.14303865064531665,0.0002777777777778051,0.014869193528929915,0.0368889625252183,0.0002777777777778051,0.0002777777777778051,0.0002777777777778051,0.02655554753000001,0.0603607016308232,0.0002777777777778051,0.0002777777777778051,0.0002777777777778051,0.0002777777777778051,0.04005371086716506,0.0002777777777778051,0.0002777777777778051,0.0002777777777778051,0.07845519682002591,0.0002777777777778051,0.06463369770637481,0.0002777777777778051,0.0002777777777778051,0.0002777777777778051,0.11796205706992402,0.01951263816117375,0.0002777777777778051,0.0002777777777778051,0.0002777777777778051,0.0002777777777778051,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0
57398,4,"Horror In The Sky I remember seeing this film when I was 7 or 8 years old and it scared me senseless . Seeing people getting their heads chopped off and mutalated from who knows what that flies around a big city gave me an uneasy eerie feeling . I did n't know what the name of this movie was and I was looking for it in the video stores . I stumbled onto this accidentally and taking my chances of this being the dragon in the sky killing people movie that I saw 20 years ago , I bought it . After seeing it again , this is the movie that scared me to death so many years ago . Though , by today 's standards , this movie is rather cheap and cheesy , it still gave me that uneasy eerie feeling . This movie is original , having a flying dragon that is summoned by ritual killings , that eats people like birds eat worms . This movie is a hybrid of Godzilla and slasher flicks . This is definately B - movie material , but it 's fun to watch and brings back some childhood memories ... and that is worth more than the price of admission",211,1,0.0004255319148936482,0.0004255319148936482,0.0004255319148936482,0.04645447760140118,0.0004255319148936482,0.0004255319148936482,0.0004255319148936482,0.0004255319148936482,0.0004255319148936482,0.0004255319148936482,0.0004255319148936482,0.0004255319148936482,0.0004255319148936482,0.0004255319148936482,0.0004255319148936482,0.0004255319148936482,0.0004255319148936482,0.0004255319148936482,0.021702127659574213,0.0004255319148936482,0.5475946689441188,0.0004255319148936482,0.0004255319148936482,0.0004255319148936482,0.0004255319148936482,0.0004255319148936482,0.0004255319148936482,0.0004255319148936482,0.0004255319148936482,0.0004255319148936482,0.0004255319148936482,0.0004255319148936482,0.05427224573054099,0.0004255319148936482,0.0004255319148936482,0.0004255319148936482,0.0004255319148936482,0.0004255319148936482,0.0004255319148936482,0.0004255319148936482,0.2637674024725305,0.0004255319148936482,0.0004255319148936482,0.0004255319148936482,0.0004255319148936482,0.04748567333651374,0.0004255319148936482,0.0004255319148936482,0.0004255319148936482,0.0004255319148936482,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

57407,4,"Has any couple ever sizzled like Harlow vs Gable ? I do n't think so , be it in the jungle , a New York high rise or at sea . Hepburn and Tracy were great , no argument . But they were so modern and urbane , not rowdy and sexy , always fighting like Harlow and Gable . China Seas is a fine example of this chemistry . Yeah , and its a pretty good story too . Gable is Capt . Gaskell , skipper of a passenger / merchant ship running from Hong Kong to Singapore . Harlow is the floozie , Dolly , he had a fling with on shore . The ship is carrying gold . There is a terrific typhoon , and a pirate raid in which the ship is seized for a while . They torture the Captain , but he does n't reveal where the gold is . Dolly is mixed up in a conspiracy with a crewman , Wallace Berry , against the Captain because she is mad at him . She of course changes her mind . The Captain is trying to ditch Dolly and thinks he 's meant for Lady Sybil , played by Rosalind Russell , an old flame . But he and Dolly really are in love . Unfortunately the collaborations between Harlow and Gable was cut short at five movies with Harlow untimely and early death several years later .",244,1,0.0006451612903226509,0.0006451612903226509,0.0006451612903226509,0.0006451612903226509,0.026362040849689787,0.0006451612903226509,0.0006451612903226509,0.07928867111376631,0.0006451612903226509,0.0006451612903226509,0.0006451612903226509,0.0006451612903226509,0.0006451612903226509,0.0006451612903226509,0.032903225766296465,0.0006451612903226509,0.0006451612903226509,0.0006451612903226509,0.0006451612903226509,0.0006451612903226509,0.3531679592678073,0.11956491528210839,0.0006451612903226509,0.0006451612903226509,0.0006451612903226509,0.09878979769799763,0.038483990741316344,0.0006451612903226509,0.0006451612903226509,0.0006451612903226509,0.0006451612903226509,0.0006451612903226509,0.0006451612903226509,0.0006451612903226509,0.0006451612903226509,0.0006451612903226509,0.0006451612903226509,0.0006451612903226509,0.08218700317950721,0.0006451612903226509,0.1428007831982819,0.0006451612903226509,0.0006451612903226509,0.0006451612903226509,0.0006451612903226509,0.0006451612903226509,0.0006451612903226509,0.0006451612903226509,0.0006451612903226509,0.0006451612903226509,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
57429,4,Almost all of it has come true ... Videodriome is a movie I 've been a fan of for years . I use the movie as a test to see if people are REAL movie and horror fans and not just posers . The best part of the film is that any day now Fox will greenlight a reality TV show where twenty - somethings are killed in front of a live studio audience . If you 're new to the work of David Croneburg- check this out ASAP and see what all the fuss is about .

WHAT WORKS : The title sequence is great , perhaps one of the best in all of cinema ( another Amazon reviewer noted this , so I 'm not alone ) ; the soundtrack is phenomenal ( 'nuff said ) ; the plot is intriguing ; the humanimal make - up is fine ( ' Hyena ' looks especially horrific ) ; the film possesses an undeniable creative pizzazz ( i.e. it 's moody , atmospheric and insane ) ; and Marlon Brando 's 35 minute stint in the film is as captivating as always ( you can probably tell I 'm a huge Brando fan -- in particular , "" One - Eyed Jacks , "" "" Mutiny on the Bounty "" ( 1962 ) , "" The Young Lions , "" "" Superman "" and "" Apocalypse Now "" [ not "" Redux "" ] ) . WHAT DOESN'T WORK : The third act of the film is almost total insanity , except for the final ten minutes or so ; as a result the story will lose the interest of those who have no appreciation for such artistic flair . CLOSING THOUGHTS : I really enjoyed seeing Brando in his old age in this flick ; it proves he had his magnetic charm until the end . If you enjoyed Brando as ' Kurtz ' in "" Apocalypse Now "" you 'll appeciate him in "" Island ; "" in fact , as already noted , Dr. Moreau is a variation of Kurtz in his old age ( i.e. nutjob in the jungle).If you 're predisposed for such a flick , "" Dr. Moreau "" is weird , but certainly worthwhile .",443,1,0.0003389830508474939,0.0003389830508474939,0.0003389830508474939,0.0003389830508474939,0.03426530681643884,0.0003389830508474939,0.0003389830508474939,0.0003389830508474939,0.02276433246673583,0.0003389830508474939,0.0003389830508474939,0.0003389830508474939,0.1985400773832346,0.0003389830508474939,0.0003389830508474939,0.0003389830508474939,0.0003389830508474939,0.0003389830508474939,0.017282688547140386,0.0003389830508474939,0.19876297114017522,0.0003389830508474939,0.0003389830508474939,0.04225808916942659,0.0003389830508474939,0.0003389830508474939,0.0003389830508474939,0.0003389830508474939,0.0003389830508474939,0.0551673414925753,0.0003389830508474939,0.0003389830508474939,0.0003389830508474939,0.0003389830508474939,0.1288832418460721,0.0003389830508474939,0.0003389830508474939,0.0003389830508474939,0.027464321293080966,0.0003389830508474939,0.0003389830508474939,0.0003389830508474939,0.0003389830508474939,0.2610523078112203,0.0003389830508474939,0.0003389830508474939,0.0003389830508474939,0.0003389830508474939,0.0003389830508474939,0.0003389830508474939,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
57456,4,"Casts Made In Heaven Casts were chosen by the author Hemingway himself . That short comment on this film opening was really the miracle . Particularly Gary Cooper as American dynamiter Roberto and Ingrid Bergman as hapless young girl Maria could happen only through the number of miracles . SPAIN IN YOUR BACKYARDAs the movie opening says shooting took place Sonora Pass in California not in Spain . Is n't it ironic because Sierra Nevada Mountain Range itself was named by Spanish reminding them of the homeland mountains when they occupied the part of California . BONDED BY MOVIE DEALAt that time movie actors were strongly tied by contracts and that prevented both Gary Cooper and Ingrid Bergman from the role Hemingway wanted on the film . To win him the movie company had to pay huge money and Maria took it by accicent . She even cut her own hair to be Maria eventually sacrificing the next movie role . DELETION OF POLITICAL ASPECTThat is why the movie became successful and became a very entertaining one . The movie focus on the love development between Maria and Roberto which was excellently shown though a bit old - fashioned . Bergman 's Maria was so natural and you can see how far she was into the role . But the time provided another politics : American hero fighting against Dictatorship an ally of Nazi and Facists . That worked far better than any of government sponsored war propaganda I suppose . SUPPORTING ACTORS and ACTRESSSupporting actors and actresses did the job quite well particularly I think ANSELMO was well performed . PABLO was also nicely acted particularly Pablo grinning at the scene of falling snow is truly scary reminding me of Jack Torrarence of SHINING.PILAR is a bit of letdown but not bad . THE ENDINGI suppect there was alternative version where Roberto could survive but the ending place it quite vague . Old fashioned theatrical ploy . I see why BUTCH CASSIDY and SUNDANCE KID ends the similar way . THE BRIDGEWhy must an American explode the bridge at THE BRIDGE AT RIVER KWAI ? The answer might be here . REAL AMERICAN DYNAMITERHemingway might have probably heard of the story of American dynamiter somewhere and combined his own self to create the hero Robert Jordan . THE GOOD WAR interviews the model of Robert Jordan , Irvin Goff . It is said Maria was created by the image of Ingrid Bergman . Verdict : Very entertaining movieRating : 91 out of 100 The presence of Ingrid Bergman alone contributes 10 point plus . Recommended for any of classic movie fans",442,1,0.00024390243902441887,0.00024390243902441887,0.00024390243902441887,0.023839452416875195,0.00024390243902441887,0.0240836500963858,0.00024390243902441887,0.00024390243902441887,0.017581502868760118,0.00024390243902441887,0.00024390243902441887,0.013351194213643433,0.00024390243902441887,0.00024390243902441887,0.00024390243902441887,0.00024390243902441887,0.00024390243902441887,0.00024390243902441887,0.00024390243902441887,0.00024390243902441887,0.4177809531667477,0.00024390243902441887,0.00024390243902441887,0.00024390243902441887,0.00024390243902441887,0.00024390243902441887,0.00024390243902441887,0.00024390243902441887,0.00024390243902441887,0.00024390243902441887,0.00024390243902441887,0.10063833977280302,0.08033087062260448,0.00024390243902441887,0.00024390243902441887,0.00024390243902441887,0.015273595763078577,0.00024390243902441887,0.00024390243902441887,0.014068518554413965,0.00024390243902441887,0.00024390243902441887,0.00024390243902441887,0.25674677809031493,0.00024390243902441887,0.026792949312420412,0.00024390243902441887,0.00024390243902441887,0.00024390243902441887,0.00024390243902441887,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0
57476,4,"Modigliani : Beautiful Art history has always been an interest of mine , and I 'm a big fan of other art movies such as "" Girl With a Pearl Earing "" and "" Merchant of Venice . "" So when I found out about Modigliani I was happy to take the time to go watch it . Not only was it worth my time , but it was a beautiful filmed movie that depicted the life of a very passionate man in a time when passion was n't looked fondly on . Everything about the movie is amazing , from the sets to the acting . I feel this is one of Andy Garcia 's best films in some time , not only is he convincing , but he fits the part of Modigliani better than any other actor could . They focused the movie around his rivalry with Picasso , which I find to be one of the most interesting things about it . You do n't only get an insight into one artist , but many . You see the life the artists were living and the obstacles they had to overcome to get their art out into the world . Modigliani also had a tragic romance with a young catholic girl , who 's father did n't want her with the struggling painter . The story is the perfect depiction of the religious standards in that time period . Overall this was a great movie , and I would strongly suggest that you take the time to check it out . You wo n't regret it , it 's probably one of the best movies of the year",282,1,0.00037735849056606667,0.00037735849056606667,0.00037735849056606667,0.00037735849056606667,0.00037735849056606667,0.00037735849056606667,0.01924844182341405,0.11864299859793773,0.048170030731374984,0.00037735849056606667,0.00037735849056606667,0.00037735849056606667,0.00037735849056606667,0.00037735849056606667,0.00037735849056606667,0.00037735849056606667,0.00037735849056606667,0.00037735849056606667,0.00037735849056606667,0.00037735849056606667,0.43515614216080034,0.00037735849056606667,0.00037735849056606667,0.0870026288589903,0.08120463598943797,0.00037735849056606667,0.00037735849056606667,0.00037735849056606667,0.00037735849056606667,0.00037735849056606667,0.00037735849056606667,0.016670266934774053,0.00037735849056606667,0.00037735849056606667,0.00037735849056606667,0.00037735849056606667,0.00037735849056606667,0.00037735849056606667,0.00037735849056606667,0.00037735849056606667,0.08308570408309829,0.01924756693617311,0.00037735849056606667,0.07647724426135645,0.00037735849056606667,0.00037735849056606667,0.00037735849056606667,0.00037735849056606667,0.00037735849056606667,0.00037735849056606667,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
57477,4,"fun and quick workout I have both Madonna Grimes workouts DVD 's and fell in love with her 10 minute workouts . It was a great way to start my day , I was hoping that this tape included two new workouts alas they were the same , but with disapointment comes satisfaction . The other 10 minute workouts give me a chance to change my early morning workouts , and learn a workout that I never thought that I would learn and enjoy doing . Jayna 's bellydance helps you to feel sexy and still enjoy the feeling you get from her low impact toning , also great moves you can use for other reasons . Rania 's upper body is really fun , some of the steps are a little harder to do on carpet since you do this barefoot . Suhaila workout I am intimidated by . I have not been able to watch it long enough to complete it . I have a little trouble getting past the control that she has on her butt cheeks . She can contract them one at a time . Some mornings I get enough energy and do multiple workouts from this tape . They are really fun . This tape has a bonus YOGA , I had never tried YOGA and this gave me an opportunity to try it . I highly recommeded this DVD / VHS . I love the 10 minute workouts . With this DVD / VHS there are no excuses you can always find 10 minutes in a day .",265,1,0.07644945979380936,0.1130374678197951,0.00039215686274514676,0.16252067129034922,0.039898608482931947,0.00039215686274514676,0.00039215686274514676,0.00039215686274514676,0.00039215686274514676,0.00039215686274514676,0.00039215686274514676,0.020319712701082814,0.00039215686274514676,0.00039215686274514676,0.00039215686274514676,0.00039215686274514676,0.00039215686274514676,0.11868947200958332,0.020000000000001194,0.00039215686274514676,0.00039215686274514676,0.00039215686274514676,0.00039215686274514676,0.00039215686274514676,0.00039215686274514676,0.08359775340472525,0.00039215686274514676,0.00039215686274514676,0.00039215686274514676,0.00039215686274514676,0.00039215686274514676,0.00039215686274514676,0.03888489578352955,0.00039215686274514676,0.12492140635683599,0.00039215686274514676,0.00039215686274514676,0.00039215686274514676,0.00039215686274514676,0.00039215686274514676,0.00039215686274514676,0.00039215686274514676,0.00039215686274514676,0.00039215686274514676,0.00039215686274514676,0.16420938364169338,0.022569207931347278,0.00039215686274514676,0.00039215686274514676,0.00039215686274514676,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0

You can feel the pain , agony and raw human emotion in his photographs . He is right in the middle of shooting with mostly a wide angle just a few feet away from danger .

I really liked the music composition , as it flowed gently with the story . In a way , I 'm glad this film didnt't win "" Best Picture "" . For one reason . The on - location scenery is absolutely breathtaking to watch . Maybe its too perfect . Later on , We find out it 's not Wyoming , but it Alberta , Canada . Take a star away !

57517,4,"Pretty Woman Pretty Woman ( 15th Anniversary Special Edition ) has to be considered one of the most classical , romantic comedies made throughout the years . Julia Roberts and Richard Gere are excellent actors together and without them I do n't believe the movie would have been the same . This classic "" fairy tale "" movie where the woman finds the man of her dreams is funny and different from the all the rest . This is not your typical romantic movie and I believe that is why so many people love this movie . Pretty Woman is a film that will always capture its audiences heart with a little added humor here and there . The 15th Anniversary Special Edition also brought some never - before - seen scenes , deleted scenes , and commentary . The deleted scenes are also a must watch , they are just simply hilarious , and you also get to see how the actors were behind the scenes . I would recommend this movie to anyone who loves romantic movies , but who also likes added comedy as well . Pretty Woman is definitely one of the greatest films ever made .",201,1,0.0004255319148936421,0.0004255319148936421,0.0004255319148936421,0.0004255319148936421,0.0004255319148936421,0.0004255319148936421,0.04538254734686378,0.0004255319148936421,0.0004255319148936421,0.0004255319148936421,0.0004255319148936421,0.0004255319148936421,0.0004255319148936421,0.0004255319148936421,0.0004255319148936421,0.0004255319148936421,0.0004255319148936421,0.0004255319148936421,0.0004255319148936421,0.0004255319148936421,0.40024092627941904,0.2385605685280606,0.0004255319148936421,0.0004255319148936421,0.0004255319148936421,0.0004255319148936421,0.0004255319148936421,0.0004255319148936421,0.0004255319148936421,0.0004255319148936421,0.0004255319148936421,0.0004255319148936421,0.0004255319148936421,0.0004255319148936421,0.0004255319148936421,0.12726500814826586,0.0004255319148936421,0.0004255319148936421,0.023554706172445056,0.0004255319148936421,0.023485907817353532,0.0004255319148936421,0.0004255319148936421,0.12321246336716533,0.0004255319148936421,0.0004255319148936421,0.0004255319148936421,0.0004255319148936421,0.0004255319148936421,0.0004255319148936421,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

I have all 4 of Jillian 's endurance strength training DVDS and they are very good especially when combined with 30 - 45 mins . cardio . The Maximize Full Frontal DVD is a little more intense than Jillian 's Shape Up Front DVD ; it has more core work , more one - leg moves and the cardio segments always use dumbbells . The Maximize Back In Action DVD is also a little more intense than Jillian 's Shape Up Backside DVD ; it has more core work , harder exercises and additional power moves . All 4 DVDs are an excellent buy and since they are all short workouts , you can easily combine them with cardio for a well - rounded 60 minute workout .

57557,4,"fun show I have n't watched the first season - I just started watching the show so I 'm a very brand new viewer - but I 've seen two episodes of season 2 and this is really a good show . Its subject matter is grim , yes , but there are light moments and the cast has nice chemistry , especially David Boreanaz ( Buffy the Vampire Slayer , Angel ) and Emily Deschanel . The stories are interesting w / out being too scientific so anyone can follow along . And I never realized how much information a person can get just by examining someone 's bones ( okay , maybe only in tv land ) .",120,1,0.0007142857142857914,0.08070205322390259,0.0007142857142857914,0.0007142857142857914,0.0007142857142857914,0.0007142857142857914,0.0007142857142857914,0.0007142857142857914,0.0007142857142857914,0.0007142857142857914,0.0007142857142857914,0.0007142857142857914,0.0007142857142857914,0.0007142857142857914,0.0007142857142857914,0.0007142857142857914,0.0007142857142857914,0.0007142857142857914,0.0007142857142857914,0.0007142857142857914,0.5285697086846254,0.0007142857142857914,0.0007142857142857914,0.0007142857142857914,0.0007142857142857914,0.0007142857142857914,0.0007142857142857914,0.0007142857142857914,0.04377454338374356,0.0007142857142857914,0.0007142857142857914,0.0007142857142857914,0.0007142857142857914,0.0007142857142857914,0.08588295631711584,0.08867240695735241,0.0007142857142857914,0.0007142857142857914,0.0007142857142857914,0.0007142857142857914,0.0007142857142857914,0.0007142857142857914,0.0007142857142857914,0.0007142857142857914,0.0007142857142857914,0.14096976000468553,0.0007142857142857914,0.0007142857142857914,0.0007142857142857914,0.0007142857142857914,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

57567,4,"The most ultra - realistic depiction of Hilter to date . Seeing / hearing a movie such as this in the German language adds another layer which makes the movie ultra realistic . Furthermore the actors who play the key roles , especially Hitler , but also Goebbels , Speer , Himler are so alike to the actual historical figures it really is eerie . What sets the film apart from other WWII / Hitler films is that the characters are portrayed as human beings -- NOT stereotypical Hollywood caricatures . What makes it chilling is that these human beings can be charming and yet a split second carry out the most horrific acts one can imagine . Furthermore the the director avoids melodrama . The events unfold on the screen naturally drawing the the viewer into the events as if one were actually in the bunker witnessing the horrifying events before the fall of Berlin . As good as Schindler 's List and Saving Private Ryan were , this film by comparision makes the them seem too contrived and over - acted .

57597,4,""" Everything For Everybody ! "" ~ A Very Merry Christmas To Us All Now with the release of the ' 38 version of ' A Christmas Carol ' I can once again enjoy the antics of the grumpy old Ebenezer Scrooge as played by Reginald Owens . In my opinion not as good as the later Alastair Sim version in ' 51 , but all in all a wonderful film that can be enjoyed by the whole family . This version is not as dark and scary as the ' 51 production , so if you have a young child you want to introduce to this wonderful Christmas story of transformation and redemption for the first time this is definitely the version they should view first .

57635,4,"Just in time for Winter ! This is my first WATP video , but I started at the highest mile because I am an intermediate / advanced exerciser so I knew I needed something high intensity to get my heart rate going , but mostly I was looking for variety in my workout . And I must say , I just love this video . It is the only video I own that MAKES me want to do it . I truly enjoy working out , but when I find a workout that makes it fun and mixes things up , I know I hit the jackpot . This workout can be perfect for most exercisers , although beginners probably want to start with her starter videos and gradually work up to the Super Challenge . Leslie is a good instructor , but as most have mentioned , she does talk quite a bit and has a very annoying laugh . But its about the workout , not the sound of her voice , and in that , WATP Super Challenge accomplishes alot .

57636,4,Exceptional Footage of The Worst DAY in our History As an American I find this video showing the incredible distruction and the first responders who are operating at the scene of this enormous tragedy compelling . To think that this terrorist attack actually happened on our soil is truly unbelievable . Another reviewer from France states that the footage is nothing special ! That is the furthest from the TRUTH ! I guess the he believes that the terrorist attack never took place !

57649,4,"A Feel Good Film With Interesting Psychological Conflict "" The Bells of St. Mary 's "" was a shrewd move by Paramount Studios and director Leo McCarey , whose successful prequel film about the likable and practical Catholic priest Father O'Malley , "" Going My Way "" , spawned the 1945 release , which included an additional element that provided the basis for an interesting psychological conflict . Irish Catholic McCarey was impressed by letters he received from movie fans who enjoyed "" Going My Way "" and suggested that he do a similar film showcasing the role that nuns played in the Catholic world inhabited by Father O'Malley . Bing Crosby had garnered a Best Actor Oscar for "" Going My Way "" and McCarey secured the services of the beautiful Ingrid Bergman to play Sister Benedict , the Mother Superior of St. Mary 's School . Crosby found himself immediately clashing with Bergman on certain points relating to the parish , but through it all a mutual respect existed between them . Each realized that the other was committed to the best interests of St. Mary's . Dudley Nichols , a Best Original Screenplay Academy Award winner a decade earlier for the John Ford film about the Irish political conflict starring Victor McLaglen , "" The Informer "" , directed his effort in the script toward presenting Crosby and Bergman in periodic conflict , but learning from those experiences . Much of the contrast , they realize , stems from the way that men and women view situations . One phase of the film showing this difference is when Bergman teaches a young student who has been victimized by a bully how to box as a means of restoring order . She feels a tinge of guilt since the youngster 's failure to fight back and receipt of a beating in the process stemmed from his obedience to her stricture against fighting at St. Mary 's . When Crosby pursues a conventional macho posture in extolling the need for protecting oneself and praises the fighting skills of the bully , the nun has had enough . She purchases a boxing instructional book written by former heavyweight champion Gene Tunney and adeptly instructs the obedient youngster in the manly art of self - defense as he ultimately teaches the bully a lesson . Crosby recognizes her teaching skill and becomes cognizant of the strength of her feminine viewpoint . An area where Crosby and Bergman cooperate is in seeking the answer to the nun 's fervent prayer . She believes that of the mortgage holder of their property , Henry Travers , who has built a modern building next door and seeks to use the church property for an employee parking lot , may through prayer and proper persuasion be convinced to give them his modern structure . The result would be a new school and no further need to use the tired current facility . The effectiveness of Crosby and Bergman stems from their soft sell technique with just the right pinch of Christian charitable thought thrown into the mix . Travers , who can not sleep nights and experiences heart problems , confides to the priest and nun separately that he wishes he was better liked . Their soft sell approach in advancing the "" It is more blessed to give than to receive "" precept along with the accompanying feel good element of charity prompts Travers to see things in a light more favorable to the interests of St. Mary's . Crosby and Bergman are delights to behold in this feel good film . They provide challenges to each other through disagreement and an effective front when they team up on the issue of greatest importance to them , the welfare of St. Mary 's parish .",641,1,0.0002777777777778023,0.0002777777777778023,0.0002777777777778023,0.0002777777777778023,0.0002777777777778023,0.0002777777777778023,0.0002777777777778023,0.24464841248074642,0.046825608455049024,0.0002777777777778023,0.0002777777777778023,0.020111278311030437,0.0002777777777778023,0.0002777777777778023,0.0002777777777778023,0.0002777777777778023,0.09012550309218505,0.0002777777777778023,0.0002777777777778023,0.0002777777777778023,0.04474795550461366,0.05367588898610484,0.0002777777777778023,0.0002777777777778023,0.0002777777777778023,0.03454188601460367,0.021250005870396264,0.0002777777777778023,0.0002777777777778023,0.0002777777777778023,0.0002777777777778023,0.0002777777777778023,0.0002777777777778023,0.0002777777777778023,0.0002777777777778023,0.0002777777777778023,0.031982767267784665,0.0002777777777778023,0.020278036383855103,0.0002777777777778023,0.0002777777777778023,0.04865267280096535,0.0002777777777778023,0.2436760027012421,0.0573695918439176,0.0002777777777778023,0.03211439028750503,0.0002777777777778023,0.0002777777777778023,0.0002777777777778023,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0

The double disc set has some nice bonus features too . Disc one contains the film with a theatrical trailer and an intruduction by Donald Richie . Disc two has a poster gallery and interviews with director Masaki Kobayashi , actor Tatsuya Nakadai , and writer Shinobu Hashimoto .

It was a very sad day when the election was stolen from Mr. Gore , but this movie gave me a new realization . That being in office would have held this man back . His talent and passion truly shine through here and are very contagious . This is not a movie that leaves you feeling hopeless and wondering what you can do . Mr. Gore lists plenty of things we as individuals can start to do to make changes . He gives a website climatecrisis.net for more ideas and info . If you think this might be too boring for your taste , give it a chance and watch it if only to see the giant jellyfish .

57684,4,"Wonderful WonderfulTerry Gilliam is the Orson Welles of our time . Lambasted by critics for his excesses , admired by others for his genius . I 'm with the genius crowd . Brothers Grimm is probably the most unfairly panned movie I 've seen in a long while . Gilliam 's style is baroque , and by a director who knows the definition . Visually , this can be quite stunning , as various nasty and beautiful things poke out of corners of a scene . Sort of like a Durer woodcut as imagined by Hieronymus Bosch . And the Brothers Grimm is perfect ground for Gilliam 's magic - a dark fairytale that is also has a clash of ideas . It 's 1812 , the Age of Napoleon , not a good time for the Imagination . Nevertheless , con - men Jake and Will Grimm are cashing in off of superstition and fear , since it 's also an Age of Anxiety , and people believe more than ever in things that go bump in the night . The bumbling Grimms are played , quite effectively by Matt Damon ( who pulls off the accent nicely ) and Heath Ledger ( a head scratching , eye - squinting success ) . Their evil counterparts , End Products from the Age of Reason , are a French general , played by Jonathan Pryce , and his wacky henchman , played by the always wonderful Peter Stormare . Little girls are disappearing in a small town , and something needs to be done about it . And the Grimms are caught in the middle . You will recognize bits and pieces of various fairy tales , as the Grimms stumble and bumble along to try and figure out the mystery . To reveal more would be cheating you out of a great tale and some genuine surprises .

57723,4,"Every one a gem Every film in this collection is a gem . Annie Hall and Manhattan are both top notch , followed by Bananas , Everything you wanted to Know about Sex , Sleeper ... heck , even Interiors was such a radical departure its worth seeing at least once or twice . But to me the real diamonds in the rough of this set are Stardust Memories and Love and Death . These two films are probably Woody 's least talked about , but really , I think they are both fantastic films . Love and Death is full of the witty one liners and pratfalls that were prevelant in his "" earlier , funnier "" works ... but you can see in the dialogue of Love and Death that Woody was maturing . And Stardust Memories , my favorite Woody film . This film says so much for anyone who fancies themselves an "" artist "" who is trying to figure out what they want to say ... and how to say it . Maybe my one beef is the lack of extras on these DVD 's ... but for the money , you ca n't beat the price of this set",205,1,0.0005263157894737256,0.0005263157894737256,0.0005263157894737256,0.0005263157894737256,0.0005263157894737256,0.0005263157894737256,0.0005263157894737256,0.0005263157894737256,0.0005263157894737256,0.0005263157894737256,0.0005263157894737256,0.0005263157894737256,0.13946056011911845,0.0005263157894737256,0.0005263157894737256,0.0005263157894737256,0.0005263157894737256,0.0005263157894737256,0.0005263157894737256,0.0005263157894737256,0.0005263157894737256,0.0005263157894737256,0.0005263157894737256,0.0005263157894737256,0.0005263157894737256,0.16814896158191983,0.0005263157894737256,0.0005263157894737256,0.0005263157894737256,0.027877375363725823,0.0005263157894737256,0.0005263157894737256,0.0005263157894737256,0.0005263157894737256,0.0005263157894737256,0.05570452178976979,0.0005263157894737256,0.0005263157894737256,0.0575812677163502,0.05033024128771175,0.09817500052606726,0.0005263157894737256,0.0005263157894737256,0.3806168084574403,0.0005263157894737256,0.0005263157894737256,0.0005263157894737256,0.0005263157894737256,0.0005263157894737256,0.0005263157894737256,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
57730,4,"Great for beginners Not being familiar with yoga , I chose this DVD because of Rodney Yee 's reputation and the low cost . What I found was an easy to follow workout that makes you feel relaxed , and yet energized , after the first session . There are no bells or whistles , just a great workout . I 've purchases two other titles in the series , Power Yoga - Strength and Power Yoga - Stamina , and I switch off each workout . Some of the moves are more difficult than others , but it gives you something to work up to . If I could n't do a stretch , I would go as far as I could and hold it . It was a great feeling when I was finally able to stand in a pose or do a stretch that initailly I was unable to do . Aside from these video 's , the only equipment that you need is a mat which is extremely important to prevent slipping and back pain ... I DO know this for a fact .",188,1,0.12659905035406943,0.09593232012778108,0.0006896551724138662,0.0006896551724138662,0.11741948206214885,0.0006896551724138662,0.0006896551724138662,0.0006896551724138662,0.0006896551724138662,0.0006896551724138662,0.0006896551724138662,0.0006896551724138662,0.13764872687307209,0.0006896551724138662,0.0006896551724138662,0.0006896551724138662,0.0006896551724138662,0.03957096853366912,0.0006896551724138662,0.0006896551724138662,0.0006896551724138662,0.0006896551724138662,0.0006896551724138662,0.038839243885645434,0.0006896551724138662,0.0006896551724138662,0.0006896551724138662,0.0006896551724138662,0.0006896551724138662,0.0006896551724138662,0.0006896551724138662,0.0006896551724138662,0.12495565219665014,0.0006896551724138662,0.0006896551724138662,0.0006896551724138662,0.0006896551724138662,0.0006896551724138662,0.0006896551724138662,0.0006896551724138662,0.0006896551724138662,0.1030989291989712,0.0006896551724138662,0.0006896551724138662,0.0006896551724138662,0.08834248560573131,0.10000693426570666,0.0006896551724138662,0.0006896551724138662,0.0006896551724138662,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0
57749,4,"Excellent for beginners / intermmediates If you can get through David 's boot camp video with moderate effort , this video may be a bit too easy for you . That said , this is an excellent workout for a beginning or intermmediate exerciser . David does a great job of breaking the exercises down and offering comments to help you maintain good form . He is very encouraging throughout . The workout progresses from easy to more difficult and can be made tougher by increasing the amount of weight used ( two dumbbells needed ) . There are a few innovative moves thrown in as well . Since the difficulty level of any workout video is relative , I 'll give a quick background of myself - I run 4 - 5 times a week , for a total of 40 + miles / week . I also lift weights 2 - 3 times a week , incorporating plyometrics and compound movements . I 've personally found David 's boot camp video to be just the right amount of intensity when using 5-lb dumbbells and think this one - on - one video is great for days I have less energy . Regardless of fitness level , you are sure to enjoy this workout . If you need to make it more intense , use heavier weights . The biggest thing to remember about David 's style ( in my opinion ) is to really * focus * on every repetition , * focus * on the muscle being worked , and * focus * on isometrics ( contracting the muscle without movement - eg . pushing against a brick wall is isometric ) . Hope this helps",289,1,0.00041666666666670356,0.00041666666666670356,0.06250054981421035,0.09879708753042944,0.07642582131569965,0.00041666666666670356,0.00041666666666670356,0.00041666666666670356,0.00041666666666670356,0.00041666666666670356,0.00041666666666670356,0.00041666666666670356,0.227217636748752,0.00041666666666670356,0.00041666666666670356,0.00041666666666670356,0.00041666666666670356,0.00041666666666670356,0.00041666666666670356,0.00041666666666670356,0.00041666666666670356,0.00041666666666670356,0.00041666666666670356,0.00041666666666670356,0.00041666666666670356,0.00041666666666670356,0.00041666666666670356,0.00041666666666670356,0.00041666666666670356,0.00041666666666670356,0.00041666666666670356,0.00041666666666670356,0.00041666666666670356,0.00041666666666670356,0.00041666666666670356,0.00041666666666670356,0.00041666666666670356,0.00041666666666670356,0.1699556699261451,0.00041666666666670356,0.03950509766750209,0.00041666666666670356,0.00041666666666670356,0.00041666666666670356,0.00041666666666670356,0.1688506143828696,0.13924752261439013,0.00041666666666670356,0.00041666666666670356,0.00041666666666670356,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0
57761,4,"refreshing new Elvis musical A fun musical comedy , THE TROUBLE WITH GIRLS is n't the usual Elvis Presley film but it 's completely charming with it 's faithful period recreation and fine supporting cast . Presley plays Walter Hale , manager of the traveling "" Chautauqua "" tent - show , circa . 1927 , who gets mixed up in the lives of the residents of the latest town to host the show . Hale finds himself falling in love with Charlene ( Marlyn Mason ) , organiser of the children 's activities ; whilst trying to help local single mother Nita Bix ( Sheree North ) when she murders her nasty married boyfriend ( Dabney Coleman ) . Presley 's numbers include "" Swing Down Sweet Chariot "" and "" Clean Up Your Own Backyard"" . It 's certainly a lot better than some of the other Elvis films from the same period ; and seeing Elvis in a more traditional musical is a great treat . Marlyn Mason , probably one of Presley 's most formidable leading - ladies , is stunning ( and her rendition of "" Sign of the Zodiac "" is a knockout ) . Nicole Jaffe ( as the amorous hotel clerk ) , Vincent Price ( eccentric speaker "" Mr Morality "" ) , John Carradine ( as a colourful Shakespearian actor ) , Joyce van Patten ( disgruntled former channel swimmer Maude ) and Edward Andrews ( as Hale 's beleaguered assistant ) are also fine . Fans of classic TV shows should keep an eye out for Anissa Jones ( "" Family Affair "" ) and Susan Olsen ( "" The Brady Bunch "" )",285,1,0.0005714285714286392,0.0005714285714286392,0.0005714285714286392,0.0005714285714286392,0.06220031415519328,0.0005714285714286392,0.0005714285714286392,0.0005714285714286392,0.0005714285714286392,0.0005714285714286392,0.0005714285714286392,0.0005714285714286392,0.0005714285714286392,0.0005714285714286392,0.0005714285714286392,0.0005714285714286392,0.0005714285714286392,0.0005714285714286392,0.0005714285714286392,0.0005714285714286392,0.2761833212142872,0.0005714285714286392,0.0005714285714286392,0.0527290751032859,0.03424810900373669,0.0005714285714286392,0.0931643767946293,0.0005714285714286392,0.0005714285714286392,0.0005714285714286392,0.0005714285714286392,0.02914285714285846,0.0005714285714286392,0.0005714285714286392,0.18996167721976823,0.0005714285714286392,0.0005714285714286392,0.0005714285714286392,0.06681686849896912,0.03335944418897108,0.0005714285714286392,0.0005714285714286392,0.0005714285714286392,0.13933681382115506,0.0005714285714286392,0.0005714285714286392,0.0005714285714286392,0.0005714285714286392,0.0005714285714286392,0.0005714285714286392,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

57767,4,"look out chan and li - here comes jaa Recently realizing that Jackie Chan and Jet Li are about done with movie making for the most part , I always wondered if there was anyone who could take over . Chan and Li are one of a kind and the best out there . Fortunately , Tony Jaa has entered the scene with skills and originality of his own . The first thing I like about Tony Jaa is he is an expert in Muay Thai fighting , something new and original for the good guy in a movie . The next thing I like is that he fights like Jet Li and does stunts like Jackie Chan , though once again he adds his own originality quite often . Ong Bak is pure action excitement - do n't expect a deep story and do expect horrible English dubbing that is just down right annoying ( you can still switch to subtitles with Thai spoken if desired ) . If these 2 things do n't matter to you , this movie just plains rocks . Its a bit slow here and there , but overall it is filled with all the action you could want - illegal club fights , an incredible club brawl fight , tons of stunts and chases , a car chase scene that is actually done with carts instead of cars , a ring fight , and a good ol finale showdown that combines great fighitng with stunts , lasting for a good 10 minutes . I also liked the background music for the movie - lots of smooth laid - back hip hop beats . I'm pleased to say that with newcomer Tony Jaa to the world of martial arts films , the loss of Chan and Li someday soon wo n't be as bad . Ong Bak is brilliant action and originality . The only thing that could make it 5 stars is if it had a better story and decent dubbing , which Chan and Li movies do much better",347,1,0.0697430622130717,0.04139797667703611,0.0003076923076923284,0.0003076923076923284,0.0003076923076923284,0.0003076923076923284,0.0003076923076923284,0.0003076923076923284,0.0003076923076923284,0.0003076923076923284,0.0003076923076923284,0.0003076923076923284,0.0003076923076923284,0.0003076923076923284,0.0003076923076923284,0.0003076923076923284,0.0003076923076923284,0.0003076923076923284,0.015688204116611433,0.017821583428548036,0.40626875758456776,0.42008178798808615,0.0003076923076923284,0.0003076923076923284,0.0003076923076923284,0.0003076923076923284,0.0003076923076923284,0.0003076923076923284,0.0003076923076923284,0.0003076923076923284,0.0003076923076923284,0.0003076923076923284,0.0003076923076923284,0.0003076923076923284,0.0003076923076923284,0.0003076923076923284,0.0003076923076923284,0.01576785876130888,0.0003076923076923284,0.0003076923076923284,0.0003076923076923284,0.0003076923076923284,0.0003076923076923284,0.0003076923076923284,0.0003076923076923284,0.0003076923076923284,0.0003076923076923284,0.0003076923076923284,0.0003076923076923284,0.0003076923076923284,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

57771,4,"MLB Bloopers DVD review This DVD was better than I could have asked for . It uses footage from the tv show This Week In Baseball [ TWIB ] , and real baseball games over the past few years to cover the silly side of America 's Pastime . It goes behind the scenes with a bunch of players including Tim Hudson , Ryan Dempster , select Phillies players , and many others , as well as looking at past characters who stand out in the game such as Tommy Lasorda and Yogi Berra .

57772,4,"Getting my feet wet . This is a sad little gem of a movie . I really liked that the plot explored more themes than just romantic love . The story had as much to do with issues of identity , community , and fidelity . In my opinion , there were a few technical and narrative flaws that kept the film from attaining the level of greatness that it should have achieved , especially when considering the quality of the performances . The slight quiver in Weisz 's voice was right on target as was Perez 's accent . The rest of the illustrious cast was more than capable . Considering the type of story and the setting , I ca n't help but think that a three - part mini - series would have been a more appropriate treatment than a feature film . I emerged from watching the movie with a feeling that there was a lot more to explore beneath the surface of each character",169,1,0.000588235294117713,0.000588235294117713,0.04363882005745443,0.000588235294117713,0.000588235294117713,0.000588235294117713,0.000588235294117713,0.000588235294117713,0.000588235294117713,0.000588235294117713,0.000588235294117713,0.000588235294117713,0.000588235294117713,0.000588235294117713,0.000588235294117713,0.000588235294117713,0.000588235294117713,0.000588235294117713,0.000588235294117713,0.000588235294117713,0.27476821062578616,0.19285710099087855,0.000588235294117713,0.03267361419893756,0.000588235294117713,0.027242178200728943,0.000588235294117713,0.000588235294117713,0.000588235294117713,0.000588235294117713,0.000588235294117713,0.000588235294117713,0.0676620283431552,0.000588235294117713,0.000588235294117713,0.000588235294117713,0.000588235294117713,0.000588235294117713,0.000588235294117713,0.000588235294117713,0.000588235294117713,0.000588235294117713,0.000588235294117713,0.3358639299359975,0.000588235294117713,0.000588235294117713,0.000588235294117713,0.000588235294117713,0.000588235294117713,0.000588235294117713,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

57782,4,"It 's A Real Cool World I 'll tell ya ... if I read one more review written by someone born after 1980 dissing Bakshi , I think I 'm going to start kicking rump and taking names . Do people diss Disney ? Hardly , until they became such a movie mill that they are computer generating what used to be created by hand with a loving touch . Look at "" Cool World "" as the AntiToonworld of "" Roger Rabbit "" . The characters are psychedelic , psychotic , retro and bent . There is a great deal of ( expected ) sexuality and lewdness , pushing the edge of the PG-13 as far as it can go . Lots of puns and inside jokes it takes an adult to appreciate , something Warner Bros. cartoons were masters at . Granted , they do n't always hit the mark here , and there 's more chemistry when the Doodles are on than when the Noids take over . But I dare anyone to watch that scene with Holli cooing "" Let 's Make Love "" to a sweating Mel Torme wannabe while she 's having trouble keeping her Noidness intact and not feel the simulataneous urge to salivate and giggle . The transformation of Noids to Doodles when the wand is removed is humorous ... a lounge lizard literally becomes one , a cowboy becomes a horse , a female lead a blank eyed Orphan Annie . The end cap , where Byrne 's character becomes a dim witted but sincere superhero , is happily reminiscent of Captain Sternn from "" Heavy Metal "" . Yes , the acting is practically phoned in . Yes , the plot is odd . But get over it , folks , it 's adult animation , and it 's entertaining .

57820,4,"Entertaining Murder Mystery and Impressive Early Example of Noir Visual Style . "" I Wake Up Screaming "" was the first film noir made at 20th Century Fox . Its greatest distinction is its visual style whose low - key lighting and dark shadows would become archetypal of film noir after World War II . Cinematographer Edward Cronjager created a striking early example of "" noir "" lighting -what John Alton appropriately called "" mystery lighting""- in this film made in 1941 , before the United States entered the War . The story is based on the novel of the same name by Stephen Fisher , adapted for the screen by Dwight Taylor , who moved the action to New York , gave it a flashback structure , and turned it into one of those hybrids so common in pre - War Hollywood that combines multiple genres : Mystery , romance , musical ( the singing scene was cut ) , comedy , suspense , and psychological drama . But the suspense does dominate . When model and aspiring actress Vicky Lynn ( Carole Landis ) is murdered , the police are quick to blame Frankie Christopher ( Victor Mature ) , a fight promoter who met Vicky when she was a waitress , introduced her to all the right people , and managed her ascent to glamour girl -until she left him for Hollywood . Vicky 's down - to - earth sister Jill ( Betty Grable ) disapproved of her career choice but does n't want to believe Frankie responsible for her death . The Assistant District Attorney thinks early on that the creepy switchboard operator ( Elisha Cook , Jr. ) at the Lynns ' apartment building is the killer , but sadistic police detective Ed Cornell ( Laird Cregar ) wo n't let up on Frankie , constantly harassing and threatening him , leaving Frankie little choice but to find the killer himself . "" I Wake Up Screaming "" opens with an eyecatching credit sequence of names in lights sprawled across a dark cityscape . That got my attention . Then we move on to an interrogation room at the police station . Frankie Christopher is harshly lit with one lamp , surrounded by police officers in the shadows . Gorgeous , dramatic , low - key lighting . The faces of some characters , even Frankie , are sometimes completely blacked out . I do n't know if that is due to a film with limited tonal range or if it 's deliberate . But it 's daring . Everywhere we go in the station house , there are bars and shadows . The implication that the characters are trapped as if in a cage is overwhelming . The police station is like a template for film noir aesthetic . This really surprised me in such an early film , but it 's fabulous . This was Betty Grable 's first non - musical role . She 's all sweetness and goodness , but she is also level - headed , practical , and brave in the mold of a film noir helper - heroine . Unfortunately , every time she appears on screen we hear "" Somewhere Over the Rainbow "" , which eventually drove me a little nuts . Victor Mature makes a strong and appealing protagonist . But the stand - out performance comes from Laird Cregar as the very creepy , obsessed police detective Cornell . He 's truly unsettling and one of the most memorable noir villains . The dialogue is n't hard - boiled except for a few lines delivered by Vicky . But "" I Wake Up Screaming "" is a superb example of the film noir style as it was entering Hollywood 's visual vocabulary . The DVD ( 20th Century Fox 2006 ) : A few scenes show some white specks and lines , but this print is generally good . Sound is good . Bonus features : A deleted scene called "" Daddy "" ( 4 min ) , in which Betty Grable sings . This does n't fit the tone of the movie well , so it was best left out . "" Hot Spot "" ( text ) is a brief account of the film 's title change from "" I Wake Up Screaming "" to "" Hot Spot "" and back again . We can watch the opening credits for the film with the "" Hot Spot "" title ( 1 min ) . There are 3 "" Still Galleries "" : A Poster Gallery ( 3 posters ) , a Production Stills Gallery of behind - the - scenes photos ( 8) , and a Unit Photography Gallery of publicity stills ( 38 photos ) . It 's interesting to note that scenes are much more brightly lit in the publicity stills than in the movie itself . There is a theatrical trailer ( 2 min ) . Film noir historian Eddie Muller delivers a good , nearly constant audio commentary .

57821,4,"A Cunning Coming - Out Charmer With a Trio of Winning Female Performances First - time feature director / screenwriter Alice Wu 's 2005 indie comedy has familiar movie themes running all through it , but it is still an unexpected charmer with its laconic storytelling , unforced humor and a trio of winning performances . With a conflicted protagonist at its core , the film shares the same souffl � -light rom - com territory as Ol Parker 's half - hearted "" Imagine Me and You "" and Ian Iqbal Rashid 's overly cute "" A Touch of Pink "" . Wu , however , manages to bring a less derivative style to her venture due to the unique cultural subtext and more importantly , because her script unspools the fates of the main characters in meticulous vignettes . The plot focuses on Wil , short for Wilhelmina , an obviously talented Manhattan - based surgical resident who has kept herself closeted from her traditional Chinese family living across the East River in Flushing . Referred to just as "" Ma "" in the story , her mother is a widowed beautician , who only speaks Mandarin to her daughter and keeps flinging potential suitors at her . Wil 's eyes , nevertheless , are set squarely on a comely ballerina named Vivian , who happens to be the daughter of Wil 's supervising surgeon at the hospital . Meantime , Ma is in her own pickle as she finds herself pregnant and subsequently ejected from the family home . Ma moves in with Wil , and the inevitable consequences ensue . There are affecting moments of lightness and gravitas throughout , but much of the charm of the film comes naturally from the three leads . As Wil , Michelle Krusiec is a terrific find , evoking the simmering turmoil of her situation in unexpected ways even when the script fails her at times . Lynn Chen is saucy and inviting as Vivian , though I wish we could have seen one scene where she dances onstage since such a strong point is made on what style she wants to pursue . Both actresses make the attraction between the characters palpable , culminating in the inevitable girl - on - girl scene . Despite the beauty of her younger co - stars , Joan Chen is almost too gorgeous to be playing such an emotionally constrained character . Even though her character is supposed to be closing in on fifty , Chen is just 43 and frankly looks ensconced in her thirties , making her the rare case of looking far younger at the end of the movie than at the beginning . Yet , she is able to convey the necessary brittle , distanced manner as Ma , making her character 's self - discovery process more rewarding . The ending is on the pat side , especially a silly multiple confessional at a wedding and a wedged - in riff on "" The Graduate "" , but it does n't compromise the sweet - natured charm of the piece . Special mention should go to Harlan Bosmajian 's cinematography , which captures the saturated colors found in the Chinese - American community . The 2005 DVD contains Wu 's thoughtful commentary on a separate track , as well as several deleted scenes , a standard , ten - minute making - of featurette and a rather dull Sundance video diary",585,1,0.0002597402597402846,0.0002597402597402846,0.0002597402597402846,0.0002597402597402846,0.0002597402597402846,0.0002597402597402846,0.014570307037522616,0.0002597402597402846,0.0002597402597402846,0.0002597402597402846,0.0002597402597402846,0.0002597402597402846,0.0002597402597402846,0.0002597402597402846,0.04003910788342484,0.0002597402597402846,0.0002597402597402846,0.0002597402597402846,0.0002597402597402846,0.0002597402597402846,0.30179212665147614,0.0002597402597402846,0.0002597402597402846,0.0002597402597402846,0.0002597402597402846,0.015995133184650085,0.0002597402597402846,0.0002597402597402846,0.0002597402597402846,0.0002597402597402846,0.0002597402597402846,0.01512390211331765,0.023161477864463646,0.0002597402597402846,0.0002597402597402846,0.0002597402597402846,0.0002597402597402846,0.0002597402597402846,0.0002597402597402846,0.0002597402597402846,0.0002597402597402846,0.05165739577040336,0.0002597402597402846,0.39981115842549436,0.0002597402597402846,0.12720004041989577,0.0002597402597402846,0.0002597402597402846,0.0002597402597402846,0.0002597402597402846,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0
57822,4,"One of the most well done movies ever Scenes from a Marriage is a Swedish film by Ingmar Bergman . To me , this is one of the best films ever . It not only captures a great story , but it is done so well . What makes the movie so great is that you can relate to how they feel , act , and generally take care of issues . This is n't one of those American films where a person breaks off with someone and they start yelling and throwing objects at them . In here , as he is telling his wife about this other lover , she is without emotions , just staring off , with no real reactions whatsoever , a way most would respond . This is basically a 3 or 5 hour film about a wife who believes their marriage is great / perfect . It is later that she finds outs that perhaps , the marriage is n't so great when she listens to a patient decribe her marriage and why she wants a divorce . There , the wife wants to plan a trip with her husband and try to improve their marriage . He later says he 's been with a woman for a while now , and shortly there after , leaves her . After a year of so , they get together to sign the divorce papers , which turns out rough at the end . After some time , they get together again , and in some way , fall in love once again , even though both are married to other people . There , the movies ends . Great film ! Hard to watch some american films now , because most just seem horrible , and in ways , corny . I 'm glad I got to see a great film like this .",320,1,0.0003571428571428891,0.0003571428571428891,0.0003571428571428891,0.0003571428571428891,0.14189746672144543,0.0003571428571428891,0.0003571428571428891,0.0003571428571428891,0.0003571428571428891,0.0003571428571428891,0.0003571428571428891,0.0003571428571428891,0.0003571428571428891,0.0003571428571428891,0.0003571428571428891,0.0003571428571428891,0.0003571428571428891,0.0003571428571428891,0.0003571428571428891,0.0003571428571428891,0.3488153742121327,0.0003571428571428891,0.0003571428571428891,0.0003571428571428891,0.0003571428571428891,0.0003571428571428891,0.07542357200480919,0.0003571428571428891,0.0003571428571428891,0.0003571428571428891,0.0003571428571428891,0.03736195737102962,0.0003571428571428891,0.0003571428571428891,0.0003571428571428891,0.0003571428571428891,0.0003571428571428891,0.0003571428571428891,0.0003571428571428891,0.0003571428571428891,0.0003571428571428891,0.0003571428571428891,0.056546355771244894,0.324240988205051,0.0003571428571428891,0.0003571428571428891,0.0003571428571428891,0.0003571428571428891,0.0003571428571428891,0.0003571428571428891,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
57824,4,"an intellegent , unapreciated gem . starring my two favorite actresses Carla Gugino and Catherine Bell Threshold starring Carla Gugino ( Special guest Catherine Bell episode # 11 Outbreak ) : i loved this show . i liked it when it was on CBS and i like it even more now that i got the dvd 's with the unaired shows to at least try to bring it to some sense of a conclusion . Carla Gugino was very good ( as usual)playing a strong woman named Dr. Molley Anne Caffrey a contingency analayst who 's job it is to come up with worst case scenarios for any natural or man - made disaters . ( earthquake , hurricanes , WWIII , epidemics , worldwide finacial depression ) you get the picture . the one she is called upon for is for a scenario named "" Threshold "" ( hence the name of the show ) . Threshold - is the contengency plan for alien invasion . her job is now to put the plan in motion . to quickly assemble a team made up of a physian , a mathmatican / linguist , an areonautics engineer and navy seal whose job it is to implement the orders she gives out usually via military force or other covert means and to protect the "" Red Team "" . and asscess the threat and plan how to stop the threat . the actors who played the other members on Molly 's team were all good and i believed and cared for them all . but this review is about Carla and Catherine so i will get to the point . Carla owned the show , she carried it off just like she did in "" Karen Sisco "" she told a great story and added importance to a very well done show . i really do believe she is one of the best and underrated actresses in the business today . and she was just stunningly beautiful . every time she was on camera you could not help but to focus on her . the camera loved her . the beauty made you look her way . but the acting , the way she carried herself . made you stay focused on her . Catherine Bell was on the episode "" Outbreak "" this episode was about about how Molly and her team discovered that one of the ways the aliens could spread and infect people was through the food supply . now they already knew this a few episodes before but , they thought they took care of it , but they were wrong . Molley needed to know exactly how they spread it , to what foods and how long did it take effect on people who ate it . so she basically drafted Catherine Bell and made her apart of the team whether she wanted to or not . Catherine Bell played Dr. Daphene Larsons . an expert on Botony and Biology . who figured out that some foods were more likely to get it and that it was mainly tomatos and food like it that they need to worry about . i 'm afraid Catherine did not get much to work with here and she was only on it for that epsiode and only mentioned it the rest . i was told that had the show been picked up and went the next year she would have been a full blown cast member . But Catherine - like Carla - was stunningly beautiful . however she does not have the same presence as Carla does when she on camera . she did a good job - but she had next to nothing to work with and there was no essence within her or her character 's personality that took over when you got over her looks as opposed to Carla when she was on . Carla was on her game and stayed on it . it was her show . Catherine did the best she could with what little she had , she was not on her game . but it was n't her show . Carla and Catherine had really no interaction together . the only one they kinda had was when Molly was briefing Daphene on Threshold and the story thus far . and that was done with Daphine sitting in a chair looking confused and over - whelmed while Molly stood in front of her and explained it all . and it was all done using cross fade and fade in - outs edits . i appreciated the effects - nice touch - but i would have liked to see some real dialogue there . i 'm pretty sure had there been an episode 14 they would have done something together like i do n't know ; kick some alien butt together or Kissed . in conclusion - i loved the show . then tension kept me going and seemed real . it was n't neardy and though it was ScFi , i really did'nt get that feeling . there was more to the story , it was intellegently done and i wanted more . but they cancelled it . the last epsiode did however give it some closeuer so you do n't feel too cheated buying one season of the show . it left you having enough questions as to where you wanted to see more , but , could still come up with your own conclusions . they ended it like they could add more to the story at a later date in a form of a movie or another show but if they never do . then i guess it is still okay . the show was supposed to last three years going in accordance to Molly 's scernario : 1 . Threshold - we have spotted and accessed the threat . 2 . Foothold - they have established themselves on earth . we have notified the public and began to stop them by any means necessary . ( Probably what season 2 would have been called . 3 . Stranglehold - if it get to this point it either means we have stopped them and sent them home or they have won and anhilated us . ( Season three title i suppose . ) she never came up with a 4th stage . i guess it would be pointless .",1080,1,0.16891065324257978,0.026585203504450736,0.00012820512820514265,0.00012820512820514265,0.00012820512820514265,0.0415910308994869,0.013427993660813658,0.00012820512820514265,0.00012820512820514265,0.00012820512820514265,0.00012820512820514265,0.00012820512820514265,0.11422625226478833,0.00012820512820514265,0.006538461538460074,0.00012820512820514265,0.044404594150209586,0.00012820512820514265,0.00012820512820514265,0.00012820512820514265,0.07047935939607226,0.0760676090209323,0.00012820512820514265,0.00012820512820514265,0.00012820512820514265,0.00012820512820514265,0.030737333815397134,0.00012820512820514265,0.00012820512820514265,0.00012820512820514265,0.00012820512820514265,0.00012820512820514265,0.029409443806685618,0.00012820512820514265,0.00012820512820514265,0.06000054325871799,0.00012820512820514265,0.00012820512820514265,0.02515602448558145,0.00012820512820514265,0.00012820512820514265,0.00012820512820514265,0.00012820512820514265,0.14870241995534952,0.06671355364851499,0.04473493982179823,0.028083814299391538,0.00012820512820514265,0.00012820512820514265,0.00012820512820514265,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0

57837,4,"Overhyped cult film finally makes good . I 'd seen this film before , in a lesser unrestored edition , and was n't that impressed . Sure there 's some over - the - top moments worth a chuckle or two , but the majority of the film is pretty leaden and dull . Hardly the unintentional laugh riot it 's reputed to be . Thanks to Mike Nelson 's biting commentary , however , now the film really is funny . Damn funny . Which is why I demand we pass legislation , the sooner the better , requiring Mike Nelson commentaries on every major DVD release from here on out . He may be Hollywood 's last best hope , the only man who can save excrement like Mission Impossible 3 and Lady in the Water from heading straight to the bargain racks.(Okay , maybe I 'm overrating Mike 's abilities just a bit - nothing short of an Old Testament - style miracle could scrape the stink off of Lady in the Water - but if Lucas gave him a crack at Episodes 1 - 3 , I think we 'd be looking at pure marketing gold . C'mon Lucas , you know you ca n't resist any excuse to re - release yet another DVD version of your little sci - fi sextology .

Too bad she is more interested in making a quick buck these days marketing herself as a pop star and making purely pop albums like "" Up ! "" instead of making enduring popular country classics like "" The Woman In Me "" and "" Come On Over "" . Maybe she 's living too well nowadays to make soulful music .

57864,4,"the ultimate film noir THE POSTMAN ALWAYS RINGS TWICE is the epitome of how sublime the Film Noir genre can be . The story of a seductive young woman who goads the handsome hired - hand into murdering her much older husband . Based on the novel by James M. Cain and boasting the stylish performances of Lana Turner and John Garfield , this film was ensured of becoming an instant classic . Over half a century later , we are still singing it 's praises . From Lana Turner 's memorable entrance as Cora Smith ( clad entirely in white and smouldering like a stack of burnt tyres ) , the audience is taken on a rollercoaster of thrills . The drifter Frank Chambers ( Garfield ) is so completely infatuated that murder can be as easy as picking up a lipstick case . Cecil Kellaway , Karl Malden and Hume Cronyn co - star . The new DVD from Warners includes a fantastic documentary about John Garfield , plus still - galleries and trailers .

57875,4,"Gene Simmons plays a fantastic bad guy ! When I am watching a 1984 sci - fi movie , I am not expecting to see an oscar calibur portrail full of twists and turns . Some may call it predictible , but myself I feel that the story flowed and made sense . Too many times have I seen a movie wher its certainly unpredictable because the plot climax comes out of nowhere . Tom Sellek plays the part well and is very believeable as a hardened and some what cynical cop . Gene Simmons in one of his only noteworthy film performances takes his KISS type persona and plays the evil genius well . I for one enjoyed this movie alot , and unlike Blade Runner did n't find myself watching it 5 times to understand the very shallow story line .

57879,4,"Eye Candy All Around ! A+ As a moderate skiier , and a filmmaker myself , this hits it home for me . Warren Miller films are always shown locally , and there 's hardly anything imaginable that could make me miss his new movie every year . Not being a Heavy Metal fan , historically the music tends to be distracting , alas this ( past ) year 's edition "" Storm "" had just the right amount of pizazz and flare to make it my favorite yet . There are moments nearly every year that I take home with me , but Storm was filled with the most amazing skiing , some of the most unique locations , and might add the most exhilarating editing I 've seen in quite a while ! Kudos to you folks!If you can appreciate the splendor of mountain island skiing that harldy anyone on earth has even seen , let alone skiied , then this DVD will certainly expediate your plans for skiing this coming season .

57907,4,""" Love Story "" told by Paul Verhoeven Few days ago , I watched the documentary "" Z Channel : A Magnificent Obsession "" ( 2004 ) about a channel that had brought the great and unavailable anywhere else films to its 100 , 000 lucky subscribers in LA in 70s - 80s . While enjoying the clips from many Foreign and Independent movies that were the best part of documentary , I was able to recognize the movie that I saw many years ago in Moscow and still remember well , I could not only recall the title . I remember that the movie was Dutch , very erotic - in the raw , brutal , twisted yet beautiful and passionate way . Watching "" Z Channel ... "" I was happy to instantly recognize "" Turks fruit "" ( 1973 ) aka "" Turkish Delight "" made by Paul Verhoeven in 1973 . I checked with Netflix , the movie was available ; I bumped it up in my queue and just finished watching it . My memory served me well - Verhoeven 's early film is as naturalistic , earthy , brutal , erotic , humorous , poetic , poignant , and captivating as I remember it . Based on the novel by Jan Wolker , "" Turkish Delight "" stars young , hot , very sexy ( and I mean it - VERY SEXY ) Rutger Hauer as a bohemian free spirited and often cruel sculptor Eric and even younger Monique van de Van as his wife Olga , child - like yet as sensual as Eric was , "" the light of his life , the fire of his loins "" . The film that describes their stormy relationship has become the most financially successful Holland 's film that was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Foreign Language film and was proclaimed by Jan Wolker a "" 75 % masterpiece"" . There are not very many directors in the world that can create the atmosphere of raw sensuality as well as Verhoeven ( of his Dutch period , especially ) . Verhoeven is known for uncompromising approach to his work , fiery temperament , and aggressive movie - making . Joe Ezsterhaus who worked with Verhoeven on two films said about him : "" The guy is like his movies : brilliant , mercurial , very daring , perverse , a wonderful series of paradoxes and contradictions ... "" "" The Turkish Delight "" is all that and I love it but I can understand how its graphic sexuality , more than one disgusting and revolting scenes ( but they had to be in the movie ) and crude behavior may put off a lot of viewers . Be prepared , "" Turkish Delight "" is delightful but it is very intense and often not easy to watch .",485,1,0.00028985507246380183,0.00028985507246380183,0.00028985507246380183,0.00028985507246380183,0.00028985507246380183,0.00028985507246380183,0.00028985507246380183,0.07838221233355314,0.00028985507246380183,0.00028985507246380183,0.00028985507246380183,0.014788044745566208,0.00028985507246380183,0.00028985507246380183,0.00028985507246380183,0.00028985507246380183,0.00028985507246380183,0.00028985507246380183,0.00028985507246380183,0.00028985507246380183,0.3012186452223851,0.00028985507246380183,0.00028985507246380183,0.01826767288446902,0.03466237788843883,0.045048069872218224,0.00028985507246380183,0.00028985507246380183,0.00028985507246380183,0.00028985507246380183,0.00028985507246380183,0.00028985507246380183,0.02640309966883608,0.00028985507246380183,0.00028985507246380183,0.00028985507246380183,0.02005509159631958,0.014839578734835974,0.00028985507246380183,0.00028985507246380183,0.12901507878390805,0.014239282886267293,0.026584970802895472,0.26577123689914656,0.00028985507246380183,0.00028985507246380183,0.00028985507246380183,0.00028985507246380183,0.00028985507246380183,0.00028985507246380183,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
57911,4,"Good fantasy flick Ladyhawke is a big step ahead of most fantasy flicks . It seems to have all the usual bits : knight on a mysterious quest , lovable thief , and a loving couple under a vicious curse . Even these ordinary pieces rise above ordinary in this film , due largely to the outstanding cast : - Rutger Hauer ( the knight , of course ) , - Michelle Pfeiffer ( the other half of the cursed couple),- Matthew Broderick ( knave with a heart of gold ) , and - Leo Kern ( aging hermit , in on the terrible secret ) . Saying much more would mean saying too much , but it has the fairy tale ending you 'd hope for and expect - good guys get theirs and the bad guys get theirs . One thing about this movie ( or maybe the DVD transfer ) truly annoys me , however . Someone messed with the colors , like a newbie camera geek who just discovered gradient filters , and has n't learned how garish they can be . To whoever did it : please get someone with normal color vision to check your work next time . Outside of that , it 's a safe , entertaining movie .

57930,4,"ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL NEW VERSION OF OUR BELOVED MISS MARPLE I 've been a Christie fan since childhood and loved the early movies in spite of Rutherford 's handling of the character . I loved Joan Hickson 's portrayal of Miss Marple and never thought anyone else could "" be "" Miss Marple for me . Therefore I expected to be disappointed with these new releases . I AM NOT DISAPPOINTED , I LOVE THIS NEW VERSION ! After I cautiously viewed the first episode I came to fully appreciate Geraldine McEwan in the role . She is subtle , confident and highly adroit and I find her refreshing and wonderful . The stories themselves are entertaining and intriquing . Some reviewers complained that the scripts do n't stick to the originals , but this is not an issue for me here . Christie 's stories stay alive and fun even after having been done so often because they are n't always done the same way . Any tweaks to the storylines keep the material fresh and even improve it at times . I think it 's fun to be surprised by my old favorites ! Hooray for Geraldine McEwan ! I hope to see many more Miss Marple stories with her in the title role",215,1,0.00047619047619052357,0.10736251605707588,0.00047619047619052357,0.00047619047619052357,0.00047619047619052357,0.051365285765472474,0.00047619047619052357,0.00047619047619052357,0.09685793328027265,0.00047619047619052357,0.00047619047619052357,0.07190440281604697,0.00047619047619052357,0.00047619047619052357,0.00047619047619052357,0.00047619047619052357,0.00047619047619052357,0.00047619047619052357,0.00047619047619052357,0.00047619047619052357,0.20053759226100895,0.00047619047619052357,0.05784108434223791,0.040046093585453434,0.00047619047619052357,0.00047619047619052357,0.00047619047619052357,0.00047619047619052357,0.00047619047619052357,0.02182851508751262,0.00047619047619052357,0.00047619047619052357,0.056301059102195294,0.00047619047619052357,0.1680174803775537,0.063360934767681,0.00047619047619052357,0.00047619047619052357,0.00047619047619052357,0.00047619047619052357,0.00047619047619052357,0.00047619047619052357,0.00047619047619052357,0.00047619047619052357,0.046481864462249334,0.00047619047619052357,0.00047619047619052357,0.00047619047619052357,0.00047619047619052357,0.00047619047619052357,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

In other words , take a lot of "" The Dirty Dozen "" , mix a bit of "" Ocean 's 11 "" and add in some "" M*A*S*H "" plus "" Catch-22 "" and you 'll have "" Kelly 's Heroes "" . The film features a battered U.S. Army infantry unit , which has been on the front lines since landing at Omaha Beach . All they have on there minds is a little R and R , that includes booze and broads . That is until Pvt . Kelly ( Clint Eastwood ) interrogates ( with a bottle of brandy ) a captured German intelligence officer , who tells him about a Nazi convoy transporting 16 million dollars worth of gold bars . Kelly hatches a plan for his unit to go thirty miles into enemy held territory and steal the gold from a small French bank , that is being vigorously guarded by three Nazi ' Tiger ' tanks . I know in this day and age it might sound rather odd , but this is one war movie , that is not only suspenseful , but is also a whole lot of fun ! Is it an accurate portrayle of WWII ? Probably not . ( I doubt there were too many hippie tank commanders during the "" Big One "" ) This 1970 release pretty much through its ' hilarious , sharp script has more of a Vietnam era mentality , which satiracally makes fun of both the army and it 's attitudes about war . Unlike the John Wayne style war films of the past , these guys are hardly trying to be patriotic heroes , but they are just trying to make it through the war with their a * * 's intact ( and maby make a little profit on the side ) . The film features a large , talented cast , some of whom , were already stars and others , who later went on to become big names in both television and film . This includes Clint Eastwood , Telly Savalas , Donald Sutherland , Don Rickles , Caroll O'Connor , Gavin MacLeod , Stuart Margolin , Harry Dean Stanton and Len Lesser ( Uncle Leo from TV 's "" Seinfeld "" ) . How can you go wrong with a cast like that ? If your in the mood for a good action picture with some big laughs mixed in , then I would highly recommend Kelly 's Heroes """,481,1,0.00028571428571431804,0.07678495566410075,0.00028571428571431804,0.00028571428571431804,0.00028571428571431804,0.00028571428571431804,0.00028571428571431804,0.00028571428571431804,0.00028571428571431804,0.00028571428571431804,0.00028571428571431804,0.025159974742406842,0.051277096220523725,0.00028571428571431804,0.00028571428571431804,0.00028571428571431804,0.00028571428571431804,0.00028571428571431804,0.00028571428571431804,0.00028571428571431804,0.21732470763922251,0.20532877442706118,0.029504105246675152,0.00028571428571431804,0.00028571428571431804,0.00028571428571431804,0.08317270274423134,0.00028571428571431804,0.015578451752448399,0.05054006946383095,0.00028571428571431804,0.074405010701599,0.00028571428571431804,0.00028571428571431804,0.00028571428571431804,0.00028571428571431804,0.00028571428571431804,0.00028571428571431804,0.00028571428571431804,0.00028571428571431804,0.00028571428571431804,0.00028571428571431804,0.00028571428571431804,0.15978129425504187,0.00028571428571431804,0.00028571428571431804,0.00028571428571431804,0.00028571428571431804,0.00028571428571431804,0.00028571428571431804,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

57971,4,"Better than I was expecting Waiting was a pleasant surprise . It 's certainly filled with crude humor , but it manages to be funny anyhow . My first job was in a restaurant much like Shenaniganz and perhaps that 's why I found the movie so worth watching . The game the employees play is over the top , but a lot of the rest of the stuff portrayed goes on . If you 're a rude anus of a customer , do n't think for a second that the wait staff and cooks wo n't mess with your food - they will . It pays to be polite and tip well , especially if you are a regular . Chi McBride 's character as the dishwasher who also dispenses free psychological advice was great , and I thought Luis Guzman did a great job as Raddimus . All in all , based on personal experience , the movie was n't that far off of what really does happen behind the scenes in a typical Golden Corral or Ryan 's Steak House .

57992,4,"His swan song An exercise in self - aggrandizement , but done so well it 's forgivable . Set in London circa 1910 , Chaplin plays an aging music hall comedian who once made audiences laugh but is now over the hill . One day as he stumbles home drunk , he smells gas , and rescues a young girl ( Claire Bloom ) from a suicide attempt . He nurses her back to health and sees to it that she resumes her dancing career . Between being philosophical about life and keeping his own career afloat , Chaplin performs a couple of old routines from the past , including a great sketch with Buster Keaton in which he plays the fiddle and Keaton the piano ( it was both their swan songs ) . The movie is autobiographical and reeks of self - importance , with a number of references to Chaplin 's carrer in pictures alluded to . But there 's intelligence , too , and not a little sentimentality ( what Chaplin picture does n't contain this ? ) , but Chaplin is such a demanding master that there is n't a moment of sloughing off or cheapness . Chaplin did everything , from writing the script to composing the music , and all of it is touched with genius . Made in 1952 , the movie , amazingly , was not seen in Hollywood until 1972 .",241,1,0.0006896551724138417,0.0006896551724138417,0.0006896551724138417,0.0006896551724138417,0.03641551886065587,0.0006896551724138417,0.0006896551724138417,0.2138896894959522,0.0006896551724138417,0.0006896551724138417,0.0006896551724138417,0.0006896551724138417,0.0006896551724138417,0.0006896551724138417,0.0006896551724138417,0.0006896551724138417,0.0006896551724138417,0.0006896551724138417,0.0006896551724138417,0.0006896551724138417,0.4206702204034875,0.0006896551724138417,0.0006896551724138417,0.0006896551724138417,0.0006896551724138417,0.05216329894832155,0.0006896551724138417,0.0006896551724138417,0.05696442648502598,0.032922307561960594,0.0006896551724138417,0.0006896551724138417,0.0006896551724138417,0.0006896551724138417,0.0006896551724138417,0.0006896551724138417,0.0006896551724138417,0.0006896551724138417,0.0006896551724138417,0.0006896551724138417,0.0006896551724138417,0.0006896551724138417,0.0006896551724138417,0.0006896551724138417,0.0006896551724138417,0.1573193658308012,0.0006896551724138417,0.0006896551724138417,0.0006896551724138417,0.0006896551724138417,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
58000,4,"Excellent Film ( and a little history ) I thought this was an excellent , excellent film . I saw it for the first time last night , and I was struck by how well it was acted and filmed . ( It was directed by Jean Renoir , so it has his skill as a baseline recommendation , but it was exceptionally good . ) In response to those who protest that it gives an unrealistic view of war and ignores its horrors , I would admit that perhaps some of the conditions were idealized ( the prison rooms looked like slightly - dingy hotel rooms , and the treatment of the prisoners.)However , one should realize how different World War One was from World War Two or other more recent wars . WWI had a few decent reasons for being fought , but primarily it was about European countries seeking to defend their national pride and expand their territorial holdings . As seen in this film and "" All Quiet on the Western Front "" , ( and the poetry of e.e . cummings ) many soldiers got into combat and realized that they were not that different than the men on the other side of the trenches . They fought for the ideals of their respective countries , but separated from the propaganda , your enemy could be your neighbor . In WWII , there was an obvious evil ( genocide ) to fight against that needed to be defeated , but WWI had mostly stereotypes to lend menace . "" Grand Illusion "" , like "" The Rules of the Game "" reflects the decline of the great aristocratic families of Europe that was occuring during and after WWI . Ancient families that had controled dynasties for centuries were left without the power they had held . The world moved on and left them in anachronism , a reality which Von Rauffenstein and Boieldieu foresee . Much of the film is focused on the universality of the human condition . It does n't deny the differences between people , but it shows how the connections between people can transcend some of these barriers when faced with the reality of war",374,1,0.299542724475275,0.0004444444444444738,0.0004444444444444738,0.0004444444444444738,0.024063054053398113,0.0004444444444444738,0.0004444444444444738,0.1769120266224003,0.0004444444444444738,0.0004444444444444738,0.0004444444444444738,0.0004444444444444738,0.0004444444444444738,0.0004444444444444738,0.0004444444444444738,0.0004444444444444738,0.0004444444444444738,0.0004444444444444738,0.0004444444444444738,0.0004444444444444738,0.0004444444444444738,0.0004444444444444738,0.0004444444444444738,0.0004444444444444738,0.0004444444444444738,0.0004444444444444738,0.0004444444444444738,0.0004444444444444738,0.0004444444444444738,0.0004444444444444738,0.0004444444444444738,0.15555097725500577,0.0004444444444444738,0.0004444444444444738,0.0004444444444444738,0.0004444444444444738,0.0004444444444444738,0.0004444444444444738,0.10756019174795083,0.0004444444444444738,0.0004444444444444738,0.022666673229153646,0.0004444444444444738,0.16776916686502916,0.0004444444444444738,0.0004444444444444738,0.027268519085119285,0.0004444444444444738,0.0004444444444444738,0.0004444444444444738,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0
